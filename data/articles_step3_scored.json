    "body": "Zelensky guarded on Tomahawk missile talks with Trump after White House meeting\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky appears to have come away empty-handed from a White House meeting after US President Donald Trump indicated he was not ready to supply sought-after Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.\nZelensky said after the cordial bilateral that he and Trump had talked about long-range missiles, but decided not to make statements on the issue \"because the United States does not want an escalation\".\nFollowing the meeting, Trump took to social media to call for Kyiv and Moscow to \"stop where they are\" and end the war.\nThe Trump-Zelensky meeting came a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone, and agreed to meet him in Hungary soon.\nZelensky believes using Tomahawks to strike at Russian oil and energy facilities would severely weaken Putin's war economy.\nWhile Trump did not rule it out, his tone at the White House on Friday was non-committal.\n\"Hopefully they won't need it, hopefully we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks,\" the US president said, adding that America needed the weapons.\nTrump said sending the missiles would be \"an escalation, but we'll be talking about it\".\nAsked by the BBC if the Tomahawks had prompted Putin to meet Trump, the US president said: \"The threat of that [the missiles] is good, but the threat of that is always there.\"\nThe Ukrainian leader suggested his country could offer drones in exchange for the Tomahawks, prompting smiles and nodding from Trump.\nZelensky also complimented Trump on his role in securing the first phase of a peace deal in the Middle East, suggesting the US leader could build on that momentum to help end Russia's war in Ukraine.\nOutside afterwards, Zelensky was asked by a reporter if he thought Putin wanted a deal or was just buying time with the planned meeting with Trump in Budapest.\n\"I don't know,\" he said, adding that the prospect of Ukraine having Tomahawks had caused Russia to be \"afraid because it is a strong weapon\".\nAsked if he was leaving Washington more optimistic that Ukraine would get the Tomahawks, he said: \"I am realistic.\"\nIn a post on X, Zelensky said he had called European leaders to share details of the meeting with Trump, adding that the \"main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe.\"\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the call with European leaders was \"productive\" and promised that \"the UK will continue to send humanitarian aid and military support\".\nIn recent days, Trump had shown an openness to the idea of selling the Tomahawks, although Putin warned that such a move would further strain the US-Russian relationship.\nOn Thursday, Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks soon in Hungary.\nAsked whether Zelensky would be involved in those talks, Trump said before his meeting sitting alongside the Ukrainian president that there was \"bad blood\" between Putin and Zelenksy.\n\"We want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" he said. \"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated.\" He added that the three leaders \"have to get together\".\nTrump said his call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow would meet next week.\nTrump had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war, but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough.\nThey spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.\nBack in Ukraine, the BBC spoke on Friday to a couple repairing the small store they own in a suburb of Kyiv, after it was obliterated by Russian missiles last month.\nWhen the store-owner, Volodymyr, was asked about Trump's forthcoming summit meeting with Putin, he began to say: \"We appreciate all support\".\nBut he stepped away as tears welled up in his eyes. After a long pause, he composed himself and started again.\n\"Truth and democracy will win, and all the terrorism and evil will disappear,\" he said. \"We just want to live, we don't want to give up, we just want them to leave us alone.\"",

    "body": "Red Cross retrieves another body of dead hostage in Gaza, Israel says\nIsrael's military says another coffin containing the remains of a dead hostage which was handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza is now back in Israel.\nPosting on X, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) urged the public to \"act with sensitivity and wait for the official identification, which will first be communicated to the families\".\nThis was echoed by a statement from the prime minister's office, which asked people to \"refrain from spreading rumours and information that is not official\".\nHamas has returned nine of the 28 deceased hostages that were still in Gaza this week - the latest one will be the tenth if forensic testing confirms the identity of the remains matches those of a hostage.\nIn a statement on Friday night, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its team had taken \"all possible measures to ensure the deceased are managed with respect\", and that Israeli forensic authorities would now have the task of identifying the remains in Tel Aviv.\nThere has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.\nOn Friday night, the IDF again stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".\nHamas has said it remained committed to the ceasefire, including \"keenness to hand over all remaining corpses\".\nThe Palestinian group accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of impeding its ability to search for hostages' remains by not allowing heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza. It has blamed Israel for making the task of finding bodies difficult, because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble.\n- BBC Verify - Aid group suspends Gaza operations after ceasefire\n- US plays down claims Hamas is violating ceasefire deal\nSpeaking on Thursday at a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack, Netanyahu said he was \"determined\" to secure the return of all the dead hostages, and that the country would continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".\nAs part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\nAfter Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior Trump advisers said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.\nThe advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe that Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.\nWhile the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.\nAt least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "'It's scary to think I could have died': How Americans are coming back from fentanyl addiction\nKayla first tried fentanyl as a troubled 18-year-old, growing up in the US state of North Carolina.\n\"I felt like literally amazing. The voices in my head just completely went silent. I got instantly addicted,\" she remembers.\nThe little blue pills Kayla became hooked on were probably made in Mexico, and then smuggled across the border to the US - a deadly trade President Donald Trump is trying to crack down on.\nBut drug cartels aren't pharmacists. So, Kayla never knew how much fentanyl was in the pill she was taking. Would there be enough of the synthetic opioid to kill her?\n\"It's scary to think about that,\" Kayla says, reflecting on how she could have overdosed and died at any moment.\nIn 2023, there were over 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US. The march of fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, seemed unstoppable.\nBut then came a staggering turnaround.\nIn 2024, the number of fatal overdoses across the US fell by around 25%. That's nearly 30,000 fewer deaths – dozens of lives saved every day. Kayla's state, North Carolina, is at the forefront of that trend.\nWhy fatal overdoses have fallen so sharply\nOne of the explanations is a commitment to harm reduction. This means promoting policies that prioritise drug users' health and wellbeing rather than criminalising people - a recognition that in an era of fentanyl, drug-taking too often ends with death by overdose.\nIn North Carolina, where Kayla still lives, and where overdose fatalities are currently down by an impressive 35%, harm reduction strategies are well-developed.\nKayla no longer takes street drugs. And she's a client of an innovative law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programme in Fayetteville. It's a partnership between the town's police and the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition. Together, they work to divert substance users away from crime, and get them on the road to recovery.\n\"If someone's stealing from a grocery store, we run their criminal history. And often we see that the crimes they're committing appear to fund the addiction they have,\" says Lt Jamaal Littlejohn.\nThis might make them a candidate for the LEAD programme, meaning they can get support to tackle their addiction, and can start thinking about secure housing and employment.\nThe proponents of LEAD say it isn't about being soft on crime. Drug dealers still go to prison in Fayetteville. \"But if we can get people the services they need, it gives law enforcement more time to deal with bigger crimes,\" argues Lt Littlejohn, who watched his own sister struggle with a substance use disorder.\n- Listen to Assignment: Drugs, Overdose, Hope on The Documentary Podcast on the BBC World Service\nKayla has blossomed. She's such a long way now from the days when she used prostitution to fund her fentanyl habit. As part of the LEAD process, her criminal record has been wiped. She recently graduated as a certified nurse assistant, and is now working in a residential home.\n\"It's like the best thing ever. This is the longest time I've been clean,\" she says.\nCritical to Kayla's recovery has been treatment. She's been taking methadone for nearly a year when she tells her story to the BBC. \"It's keeping me from going back,\" she believes.\nMethadone and buprenorphine are medications used to treat opioid use disorder. They stem cravings and stop painful withdrawal. Nationwide, treatment has played a role in puncturing the overdose fatality statistics.\nIn North Carolina, it's been a game-changer: more than 30,000 people were enrolled in a programme in 2024, with numbers climbing in 2025.\n'You're still playing Russian roulette, but your odds improve'\nAt 09:00 at one of the Morse Clinics in the state capital of Raleigh, two or three people wait their turn in reception.\n\"The busiest time is 5.30am to 7am, so before work,\" says Dr Eric Morse, an addiction psychiatrist running nine clinics offering medication assisted treatment (MAT) in North Carolina. \"Most of our folks are working - once they're sober, they show up to work on time every day.\"\nThe clinic runs a finely-tuned operation. After patients check in, they're called to a dosing window to receive their prescription. They're in and out in minutes.\nThey'll randomly be drug tested for illicit narcotics. Dr Morse says around half his patients are still testing positive for opioids bought on the street, but he doesn't see this as failure.\n\"Maybe you're using once a week and you're used to using three times a day… You're still playing Russian roulette with fentanyl but you've taken a whole bunch of bullets out of the chamber, so your survival rate goes up significantly,\" says Dr Morse.\nThis is harm reduction. So rather than be expelled from the treatment programme, patients who get a positive drug test are given extra support and counselling. Dr Morse says 80-90% will eventually stop using street drugs altogether. And in time, many will taper off their medication too.\nThe abstinence debate\nNot everyone thinks this is the right approach.\nMark Pless is a Republican who sits in North Carolina's state House of Representatives, and used to be a full-time paramedic. He points out that illegal drug-taking starts with a choice.\nAnd he doesn't believe in harm reduction. In particular he's against treating opioid use disorder with medications like methadone or buprenorphine.\n\"You're replacing an addictive product with another addictive product,\" he says. \"If you have to take it in order to stay clean, it's still addictive. We've got to figure out how to get people to where they can do better – we can't leave them on drugs forever.\"\nHe favours abstinence treatment programmes, when drug users go \"cold turkey\".\nBut there's pushback from health professionals in North Carolina.\n\"I believe there are multiple paths to recovery,\" says Dr Morse. \"I'm not pooh-poohing abstinence-based treatment - except when you look at the medical evidence.\"\nDr Morse references a Yale University study from 2023 analysing the risk of death for opioid users in a treatment programme compared to people not in treatment. The study suggested that someone in abstinence treatment was as likely - or more more likely - to have a fatal overdose as a person who wasn't in treatment and was continuing to use street opioids like fentanyl.\nTreatment aside, another drug is helping.\nNaloxone is widely available, and used as a nasal spray it reverses the effect of an opioid overdose, helping someone breathe again. In North Carolina in 2024, it was administered more than 16,000 times. That's potentially 16,000 lives saved – and these are only the overdose reversals that have been reported.\n\"This is as close to a miracle drug as we can ever imagine,\" says Dr Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist specialising in street drugs at the University of North Carolina.\nMany users of narcotics like cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin want to know that what they're taking won't kill them. Some people use test-strips to check for fentanyl, because they know it's been implicated in so many fatal overdoses.\nBut the strips don't identify all potentially harmful substances. Dr Dasgupta runs a national drugs-testing laboratory. Users send him a tiny bit of their drug supply via local non-profit organisations.\n\"We've analysed close to 14,000 samples from 43 states over the last three years,\" he says.\nA generational shift\nTesting drugs for potentially dangerous additives is an additional weapon in the harm reduction armoury. Dr Dasgupta believes another reason for decreasing overdose fatalities in the US is that young people are avoiding opioids like fentanyl.\n\"We see a demographic shift. Generation Z are dying of overdose much less frequently than their parents or their grandparents' generations were at the same age,\" he says.\nDr Dasgupta isn't entirely surprised 20-somethings are steering clear of opioids. A shocking four out of 10 American adults know someone whose life has been ended by an overdose.\nIt was this epidemic of death, set in train in the 1990s by prescription opioids, that motivated North Carolina's former attorney general - now the state governor - to move against powerful corporations benefitting from so many Americans' dark spiral down into addiction.\nJosh Stein picked up the phone to his counterparts in other states, and took a leading role in co-ordinating legal action against opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers.\n\"There was a Republican attorney general in Tennessee, I'm Democrat in North Carolina… But we're all caring about our people and we're all willing to fight for them,\" Stein reflects.\nThe upshot, after years of intense negotiations, was an Opioid Settlement totalling some $60bn (£45bn). This is money that huge companies have agreed to pay to US states, to be used for the \"abatement of the opioid epidemic\". North Carolina's share is around $1.5bn.\n\"It has to be spent in four ways – drug prevention, treatment, recovery, or harm reduction. I think it's transformative,\" says Governor Stein.\nMeanwhile, funding from the national government is uncertain. The cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could have a tremendous impact on this area.\nIn the Morse Clinics in Raleigh, 70% of patients depend on Medicaid. If they lose health insurance, will they end treatment and become more vulnerable to death by overdose? Although North Carolina's drug fatality statistics look optimistic, thousands of people are still dying - and the state's black, indigenous and non-white populations haven't experienced the same rates of decrease.\nAnd there remain other states that have witnessed a stubbornly slower rate of decrease in lethal overdoses - including Nevada and Arizona.\nNo one is complacent. Least of all Kayla.\nIn the grip of fentanyl for three long years, she never overdosed herself, but she did have to save her friends. Kayla's parents didn't know what to do with her.\n\"They kind of gave up on me - they thought I was gonna be dead,\" she remembers.\nKayla credits Charlton Roberson, her harm reduction mentor, as being instrumental in her recovery. Her aim now is to taper off methadone and become medication- and drug-free. She also wants to find a job in a hospital.\n\"I feel more alive than I ever did when I was using fentanyl,\" she says.\nIf you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "Mystery heatwave warms Pacific Ocean to new record\nThe waters of the north Pacific have had their warmest summer on record, according to BBC analysis of a mysterious marine heatwave that has confounded climate scientists.\nSea surface temperatures between July and September were more than 0.25C above the previous high of 2022 - a big increase across an area roughly ten times the size of the Mediterranean.\nWhile climate change is known to make marine heatwaves more likely, scientists are struggling to explain why the north Pacific has been so hot for so long.\nBut all this extra heat in the so-called \"warm blob\" may have the opposite effect in the UK, possibly making a colder start to winter more likely, some researchers believe.\n\"There's definitely something unusual going on in the north Pacific,\" said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.\nSuch a jump in temperatures across a region so large is \"quite remarkable\", he added.\nThe BBC analysed data from the European Copernicus climate service to calculate average temperatures between July and September across a large area of the north Pacific, sometimes known as the \"warm blob\".\nThe region extends from the east coast of Asia to the west coast of North America, the same area used in previous scientific studies.\nThe figures show that not only has the region been warming quickly over the past couple of decades, but 2025 is markedly higher than recent years too.\nThat the seas are getting hotter is no surprise. Global warming, caused by humanity's emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, has already trebled the number of days of extreme heat in oceans globally, according to research published earlier this year.\nBut temperatures have been even higher than most climate models - computer simulations taking into account humanity's carbon emissions - had predicted.\nAnalysis of these models by the Berkeley Earth group suggests that sea temperatures observed across the north Pacific in August had less than a 1% chance of occurring in any single year.\nNatural weather variability is thought to be part of the reason. This summer has seen weaker-than-usual winds, for example. That means more heat from the summer sunshine can stay in the sea surface, rather than being mixed with cooler waters below.\nBut this can only go so far in explaining the exceptional conditions, according to Dr Hausfather.\n\"It certainly is not just natural variability,\" he said. \"There's something else going on here as well.\"\nOne intriguing idea is that a recent change to shipping fuels might be contributing to the warming. Prior to 2020, dirty engine oil produced large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a gas harmful to human health.\nBut that sulphur also formed tiny, Sun-reflecting particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols, which helped to keep a lid on rising temperatures.\nSo removing that cooling effect in shipping hotspots like the north Pacific could be revealing the full impact of human-caused warming.\n\"It does seem like sulphur is the primary candidate for what's driving this warming in the region,\" said Dr Hausfather.\nOther research suggests that efforts to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities has played a role in warming the Pacific too.\nThat dirty air did a similar job to shipping in reflecting sunlight away, while cleaning it up could have had the unintended consequence of allowing more ocean heating.\nPossible impacts for the UK?\nThe north Pacific's marine heatwave has already had consequences for weather on both sides of the Pacific, likely boosting very high summer temperatures in Japan and South Korea and storms in the US.\n\"In California, we've seen supercharged thunderstorms because the warm ocean waters in the Pacific provide heat and moisture,\" said Amanda Maycock, professor in climate dynamics at the University of Leeds.\n\"In particular, there are things we call atmospheric rivers… bands of air, which contain very high amounts of moisture that fuel themselves from the ocean waters,\" she added.\n\"So if we have warm ocean waters… they can then bring a lot of moisture onto the land, which then falls out as rain, or in the wintertime can precipitate out as snow.\"\nLong-term weather forecasting is always challenging, but extreme heat in the north Pacific has the potential to affect the UK and Europe in the coming months too.\nThat's because of relationships between weather in different parts of the world known as teleconnections.\n\"Although the current warm conditions are located in the north Pacific, these can generate wave motions in the atmosphere that can alter our weather downstream into the north Atlantic and into Europe,\" said Prof Maycock.\n\"That can tend to favour high-pressure conditions over the continent, which brings us more of an influence from the Arctic, where we have colder air,\" she added.\n\"That can be drawn over Europe and bring us colder weather in early winter.\"\nA colder outcome is by no means certain, as this is a complex area of science. Several other weather patterns also affect UK winters, which are typically getting milder with climate change.\nAnd a warm north Pacific appears to have different effects later in the winter, favouring milder and wetter conditions in some parts of Europe.\nEmerging La Niña in the tropical Pacific\nAnother factor to throw into the mix is what's happening further south in the eastern tropical Pacific.\nThere, surface waters are unusually cool - a classic sign of the weather phenomenon known as La Niña.\nLa Niña, and its warm sibling El Niño, are natural patterns, although research published this week highlighted that global warming could itself impact the swings between them.\nWeak La Niña conditions are expected to persist over the next few months, according to NOAA, the US science agency.\nAll else being equal, La Niña generally increases the risk of a cold start to winter in the UK, but also brings a higher chance of a mild end, the Met Office says.\n\"These two drivers in the north and tropical Pacific will be acting together this winter,\" said Prof Maycock.\n\"But since the La Niña is quite weak this year, the extreme warmth in the north Pacific could be more important for forecasting the winter ahead.\"\nAdditional reporting by Muskeen Liddar and Libby Rogers\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

    "body": "'Only sport we watch': Grand Sumo comes to London as search for fans beyond Japan pays off\nThere are not many sports that can keep an audience enraptured through 45 minutes of ceremony before the first point is even contested.\nAnd yet, the intricate traditions unfolding in a small clay ring - virtually unchanged in hundreds of years - managed to do just that.\nWelcome, then, to the Grand Sumo Tournament - a five-day event at the Royal Albert Hall featuring 40 of the very best sumo wrestlers showcasing a sport which can date its first mention back to 23BC.\nLondon's Victorian concert venue has been utterly transformed, complete with six-tonne Japanese temple roof suspended above the ring.\nIt is here the wrestlers, known as rikishi, will perform their leg stomps to drive away evil spirits, and where they will clap to get the attention of the gods.\nAnd above all this ancient ceremony, a giant, revolving LED screen which wouldn't look out of place at an American basketball game, offering the audience all the stats and replays they could want.\nSumo may be ancient, and may have strict rules governing every aspect of a rikishi's conduct, but it still exists in a modern world.\nAnd that modern world is helping spread sumo far beyond Japan's borders.\nIt was a \"random video\" which first caught Sian Spencer's attention a couple of years ago.\nThis was quickly followed by the discovery of dedicated YouTube channels for a couple of the sumo stables, where rikishi live and train, waking up early to practice, followed by a high protein stew called a chankonabe, and then an afternoon nap - all in the service of bulking up.\nThen she discovered the bi-monthly, 15 day championships, known as basho, and from there, she was hooked.\nThe London tournament was simply a \"once-in-a-lifetime\", not-to-be-missed, opportunity to see it all in real life, the 35-year-old says.\nJulia and her partner Cezar, who live in Edinburgh, discovered sumo through a more traditional route: a trip to Japan six years ago.\n\"We saw it as a very touristy activity, but we actually ended up loving the sport,\" says Julia, 34.\n\"From there on, we tried to find communities, information, just to learn more and more about it,\" Cezar, 36, adds.\nColleagues, friends and family, they found, could be quite taken aback by their new passion.\n\"It's the only sport we watch,\" explains Julia - so they found like-minded people on messaging apps like Telegram.\n\"We found Italian groups, English groups,\" says Julia.\n\"Outside of Japan, online is the only way to interact with the sport,\" adds Cezar.\nGoing to Japan is almost the only way to see a top-flight sumo tournament.\nThis week's event in London is only the second time the tournament has visited the city - the first time was in 1991 - while the last overseas trip was to Jakarta in 2013.\nBut even going to Japan isn't a guarantee of getting a seat. Last year was the first time in 24 years that all six of the bi-monthly, 15-day events had sold out in 28 years, Kyodo News reported - fueled by interest at home, and by the tourist boom which saw more than 36m foreigners visit in 2024.\nSo for many, the London tournament is the first time they have watched sumo in person - and it doesn't disapoint.\n\"Seeing it up close, you get a sense of the speed and the power which you don't get on TV. It was incredible,\" says Caspar Eliot, a 36-year-old fan from London. \"They are so big.\"\nTo win, one man needs to push another out of the ring or to the ground using brute strength. The majority use one of two styles to achieve this, often in split seconds - pushing, or grappling.\nEither way, the sound of the two rikishi colliding in the first moment of the match reverberates around the hall.\nCaspar and his wife Megha Okhai had been among those lucky enough to get tickets when they visited Japan last year - only for them not to arrive in the post in time.\nIt didn't stop them falling head over heels, however, and they have watched every basho this year. So when it came to the London Grand Sumo Tournament, they weren't taking chances.\n\"I think we had four devices trying to book tickets,\" Caspar tells the BBC ahead of the event, displaying his sumo towels proudly - a must for diehard fans. \"We got front row seats, on the cushions.\"\nThe cushions right next to the ring are of course highly prized - but also, a bit risky.\nOn Thursday, it was all 181kg and 191cm of Shonannoumi which went plummeting into the crowd - perhaps making those in the slightly cheaper seats breathe a sigh of relief.\nOf course, the size of the rikishi is one of the first things most people think of when they think of sumo. The Albert Hall's director of programming revealed to The Guardian earlier this week that they \"had to source and buy new chairs which can take up to 200kg in weight\".\nBut sumo - for all its sell-out events - is not without its troubles behind the scenes. A series of scandals over the last couple of decades around bullying, match fixing and sexism have dented its image.\nAnd then there is the fact that last year - while being a bumper one for ticket sales - saw the lowest number of new recruits joining the stables.\nPerhaps the strict life of a rikishi doesn't look as appealing as it once might have. Its popularity among young Japanese is also being threatened by other sports, like baseball. As Thomas Fabbri, the BBC's resident sumo fan, said: \"My Japanese friends think I'm mad, as they see it as a sport for old people.\"\nJapan's falling birthrate will also not help - nor is the Japanese Sumo Association's rule which restricts each stable to just one foreign rikishi. Despite this, Mongolians have dominated for the past few years - and one of the most exciting rising stars hails from Ukraine.\nNot that any of this has worried fans in London.\n\"Seeing all this ritual and ceremony that goes with sumo is quite special,\" fan Sian says. \"Now, seeing it in person, you feel like you are more part of it.\"\nJulia and Cesar agree in a message the next day.\n\"It's a Japanese sport but we didn't feel out of place, so many people from all around the world around us.\"\nFor Megha, the drama \"made it so incredible\" - as did meeting the other fans.\n\"Getting out of a very niche Reddit community and being able to see all these sumo fans in person and being able to chat with other people who are just as into this as we are - it was worth every penny of sumo gold.\"\nAdditonal reporting by Thomas Fabbri\nWant to watch?

    "body": "Can Putin's 'Flying Kremlin' travel through EU airspace to Budapest?\nThe summit has not been set in stone, but if Russia's Vladimir Putin does go to Budapest to meet US President Trump in the next two weeks, he would need to clear a few hurdles first.\nWhen Putin travelled to Alaska for his Anchorage summit in August, the US granted special permission for the presidential plane - a modified Ilyushin Il-96 airliner dubbed the \"Flying Kremlin\" that has four engines and is bristling with defence systems.\nRussian planes are banned from US airspace, and from EU airspace too. So if Putin does fly to Budapest he would need special dispensation if he decided to fly over an EU member state.\nIt is perfectly possible, but landlocked Hungary is not the easiest destination to get to for a Russian president who rarely sets foot abroad and has not travelled to the EU for years.\n\"For now, of course, it's not clear,\" says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"What we do have is the willingness of the presidents to hold such a meeting.\"\nDays after Putin ordered Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU froze the assets of both its leader and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nA blanket ban was also imposed on all Russian aircraft flying through the airspace of all 27 EU countries. Hungary and many of its neighbours are Nato member states too.\nPutin has also been accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of war crimes of unlawfully deporting and transferring of Ukrainian children to Russia.\nSo there are complications, although Hungary believes they can all be sorted out. Hungary is in the process of pulling out of the ICC anyway.\nPutin and Hungary's Viktor Orban, probably his closest ally in the EU, have already discussed the planned summit over the phone, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has told reporters \"we will of course ensure that he can enter Hungary, hold successful talks here, and then return home\".\nThe EU is unlikely to create obstacles either.\nIts executive commission has said any meeting that moves forward \"a just and lasting peace for Ukraine\" is welcome and it supports President Trump's efforts towards that.\nOne of the main drivers for its latest proposed sanctions on Russia - the 19th package so far - is to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, it says. And it points out there's no travel ban on Putin, only an asset freeze.\nThe biggest sticking point is how Russia's leader will fly from Moscow to Budapest. Clearly he will not be buying an Air Serbia ticket to Belgrade and catching the train to Hungary, which may be the most direct route to take.\nHe will want his Il-96 plane to guarantee his safety, but that will probably mean using the airspace of an EU and Nato member state and obtaining permission to break the EU's ban on Russian planes.\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said on Friday that \"in terms of the direction of travel, member states can give derogations but it must be given by member states individually\".\nNato has also referred the issue to respective national authorities, and as Trump is involved they may acquiesce.\nEven with dispensation, a look at the map shows Putin may have to take a circuitous route. Ukraine is out of the question, and probably Poland too because of Warsaw's icy relations with Moscow.\nPerhaps the most direct route goes via the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Turkey, through Bulgaria and either Serbia or Romania into Hungary.\nSerbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, knows Putin well and Air Serbia has direct flights to Moscow over EU airspace. Serbia is a candidate to join the EU but is not a member.\nIt is the EU countries, Bulgaria or perhaps Romania, that would need to give consent, and they would have to escort Putin's plane through their airspace.\nRomania has what is set to become the biggest Nato base in Europe, and Bulgaria is also building a Nato base as part of efforts to shore up the defensive alliance's eastern flank.\nThe BBC has approached the foreign ministries of both countries for comment.\nIf Putin wants to play it even more safely, he could fly via Turkey, around the south coast of Greece and then up through Montenegrin airspace before going over Serbia. But it is a far longer route.\nBudapest is not then the easiest of venues, even if it works very well for Viktor Orban, who has long had good relations with both Putin and Donald Trump.\n\"It's a leader that we like,\" said Trump on Friday, \"he likes him, I like him.\"\nA high-profile international summit will do Orban no harm at all, as he is trailing in the polls before elections next spring.\nWithin hours of Budapest being named as a venue, Orban was on the phone to Putin and declared on his Facebook page: \"Preparations are in full swing!\"\nOrban has little time for the EU's backing of Ukraine and he was quick to make clear Brussels would have nothing to do with the talks.\n\"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he told Hungarian radio on Friday.\nEuropean leaders will have other ideas when they see him at next week's summit in Brussels next week.",

    "body": "'Have a great life!' Trump orders prison release of disgraced ex-lawmaker Santos\nUS President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identify theft, ordering his immediate release.\nIn a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"\nThe former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023.\nSantos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people - including from his own family members, is currently serving his sentence at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.\nIn April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"\nHe reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"\nProsecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.\nIn his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service.\n\"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.\nTrump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old.\n\"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly reelecting me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month.\nA lawyer for Santos told the Associated Press that it remains unclear when his client would be released.\n\"The defence team applauds President Trump for doing the right thing,\" said Andrew Mancilla.\n\"The sentence was far too long.\"\nSantos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\nFrom there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.\nHe was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.\nA report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.\nSantos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.\nEarlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned.\nThe letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"\nHe wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions.\n\"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\n\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\n\"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"\nTrump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.\nIn May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.\nHe also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.",

    "body": "Polish judge refuses to extradite Ukrainian Nord Stream blasts suspect\nA Polish judge has refused to extradite a Ukrainian citizen – suspected by Germany of sabotaging the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September 2022 – arguing that if Ukraine was responsible for the attack, then it was a \"just\" act.\nVolodymyr Zhuravlyov, who was brought to Warsaw District Court in handcuffs, was detained in Poland last month on a European arrest warrant.\nJudge Dariusz Lubowski ordered his release, after a ruling that was met with a ripple of surprise from the crowd in court and a smile from the man in the dock.\nMr Zhuravlyov, along with others, is suspected of planting explosives deep beneath the Baltic Sea on the pipelines leading from Russia to Germany.\nBlame for the blasts, which crippled a long-controversial energy supply line from Russia to Germany, initially focused on Moscow until signs of Ukrainian involvement began to emerge.\nOfficials in Kyiv have repeatedly denied any role.\nExtradition cases within the EU are usually quick and straightforward, but the Nord Stream case is proving to be very different.\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, whose government is a key ally of war-torn Ukraine, immediately posted on X that the ruling was right.\n\"Case closed,\" he wrote.\nInside the giant district courthouse in Warsaw, Judge Lubowski announced his decision to the suspect, his family and legal team – and a large cluster of TV cameras.\nIn a long and passionate speech, he said he was considering only the request to send Mr Zhuravlyov to Germany, not the substance of the case itself. But he was clear that the context of the war in Ukraine was critical.\nThe judge described Russia's invasion as \"a bloody and genocidal attack\" and argued, quoting Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas, that Ukraine had the legal right to defend itself.\n\"If Ukraine and its special forces… organised an armed mission to destroy enemy pipelines – which the court does not prejudge – then these actions were not unlawful.\n\"On the contrary, they were justified, rational and just,\" he told the court.\nHe said the attack had \"deprived the enemy of billions of euros paid by Germany for the gas… and weakened Russia's military potential\".\nWhat could be seen as terrorism or sabotage in peace time, the judge said, was different in a time of war.\nGermany had in fact halted use of the two Nord Stream 1 pipelines after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 had not yet entered service.\nPoland has always been a vocal critic of that project for making Berlin too dependent on Moscow. The route deprived Poland of transit fees for the gas. Ukraine and the US were also longstanding opponents of the pipelines.\nJudge Lubowski insisted, though, that his ruling was a legal one, and not emotional or political.\nHe also questioned whether Germany had jurisdiction even to bring its case, as the explosions were in international waters on pipelines with majority Russian state ownership.\nAnnouncing that Mr Zhuravlyov would be released from custody, he said the Ukrainian would also get compensation from the Polish state.\n\"I am happy… it was a really very hard three weeks,\" Mr Zhuravlyov's wife, Yulianna, told the BBC in court after the judge's verdict.\n\"For me, as a Ukrainian, it was very important to hear that he understands us.\"\nShe said the family planned to stay in Poland, where they have lived since February 2022.\nEarlier, she described her husband's arrest at their home just outside Warsaw and said he denied any involvement in the sabotage.\nVolodymyr Zhuravlyov is a deep-sea diver, his wife has confirmed, but she called it a hobby and said he had no military role.\nHe has a business in Poland installing air conditioners. Mrs Zhuravlyova could not tell the BBC exactly where her husband was when three of the four Nord Stream pipelines were blown up, because she said no-one had asked her to check.\nHe is not the only suspect on Germany's list: another Ukrainian man was detained in Italy in August when he was on holiday.\nSerhiy Kuznetsov was also accused of \"unconstitutional sabotage\" and has denied any connection to the blasts. He is currently in a high security prison in northern Italy.\nA court in Bologna did rule he should be extradited to Berlin but earlier this week that verdict was annulled by the top appeals court in Rome and the case has been returned to Bologna to begin all over again.\nAsked about the decision, Germany's foreign minister said he respected the ruling and it was not the job of government to interfere with the courts.",

    "body": "Netanyahu 'determined' to pressure Hamas to find remaining dead hostages\nIsrael's prime minister has told a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that he is \"determined\" to secure the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza, and that the country will continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".\nBenjamin Netanyahu made the comments hours after Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages but said it was not able to access the remaining 19.\nThere has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all the bodies in line with last week's Gaza ceasefire deal, though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.\nHamas said later it remained committed to the ceasefire, including \"keenness to hand over all remaining corpses\".\nIn a statement, it accused Netanyahu of impeding its ability to search for hostages' remains by not allowing heavy machinery and diggers into the Gaza Strip.\nThe group is continuing to try to recover captives' bodies. In footage broadcast on Al Jazeera, Hamas gunmen appear to guard bulldozers digging in the dark in the southern city of Khan Younis.\nThe BBC understands that Hamas has given mediators coordinates and aerial photographs of bodies' locations.\nUS President Donald Trump meanwhile has signalled he was willing to see fighting resume if Hamas \"continues to kill people\", seemingly referencing reports of violence inside Gaza, where Hamas has been accused of violently targeting internal rivals in recent days.\nWriting on his Truth Social platform, the US president said \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill\" if the group did not desist.\nTrump has previously ruled out putting American soldiers on the ground in Gaza.\nEarlier on Thursday, the Israeli government confirmed that two bodies handed over by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday night had been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash.\nTheir return, which was overseen by masked Hamas gunmen in Gaza City, took the number of dead hostages returned since Monday to nine out of 28.\nAll 20 living hostages were released on Monday, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.\nIsrael has responded to the delay in returning all the bodies by threatening to restrict the amount of aid flowing into Gaza.\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu addressed an official memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl national cemetery in Jerusalem, two days after the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the 7 October attack.\nThe prime minister said he remained committed to securing the return of all the dead Israeli and foreign hostages, and reiterated his government's willingness to return to military action if Israel was attacked again.\nHe said: \"Our fight against terrorism will continue with full force. We will not allow evil to raise its head. We will exact the full price from anyone who harms us.\"\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.\nAt least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said Netanyahu's government should \"immediately halt the implementation\" of the ceasefire deal until the 19 bodies were returned.\nAfter Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing.\nThe advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.\nWhile the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.\nOne senior US adviser pointed to the level of destruction in Gaza as one reason the search might be slowed, and said rewards could be offered to civilians with information about the location of remains.\nHamas has complained to mediators that more than 20 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Friday.\nIsrael's military, which still controls more than half the territory, has said that it opens fire to remove threats to its troops.\nMeanwhile in Gaza, work is under way to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel in recent days in exchange for the hostages' bodies. A further 30 were returned on Thursday, taking the total to 120.\nThere had been some reports that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would reopen on Thursday, having been shut since the Gaza side was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024.\nThe ceasefire deal specifies its reopening would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, when wounded Palestinians were briefly allowed to pass through to receive medical treatment.\nOn Thursday, an official from Israeli military body Cogat said: \"The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations.\"\nThe official also stressed that \"aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing\". Instead, they said, it would continue to enter Gaza through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel and other crossings following Israeli security inspections.",

Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.\nBorn in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.\nAnton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\n\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.\nFor a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.\nA sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.\nTributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"\nAnother Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\".\n\"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.\nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

The opportunity in front of us is that we can find many more cancers - and many of the more aggressive cancers - at a much earlier stage when we have more effective and potentially curative treatments.\"\nNaser Turabi of Cancer Research UK said: \"Further research is needed to avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm. The UK National Screening Committee will play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS.\"",

    "body": "Buying more, wearing less - why India's Diwali gold rush is different\nAhead of the Hindu festival of Diwali, the jewellery market in Indian capital Delhi's vibrant Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood is teeming with crowds.\nShops have stayed open even on holidays, and at dusk, dozens of cars line up the streets as a string of flashy signboards beckon shoppers into the flower-adorned stores.\nSoaring gold prices - which have topped $1,440 (£1,081) for 10g - may have slightly dented demand for jewellery in the world's second largest market for the yellow metal this year, but Indians are not willing to entirely give up on their penchant for gold yet.\nDiwali, along with Dhanteras - a smaller festival that falls on Saturday this year - are believed to be auspicious occasions to buy precious metal, with hundreds of thousands of Indians flocking the markets to buy gold and silver coins, bars and jewellery, which they believe bring wealth and luck.\nSkyrocketing prices have created FOMO - or the fear of missing out - in the minds of buyers, who are worried prices might rise even further, Prakash Pahlajani, who runs Kumar Jewels, a family-owned business, told the BBC on a busy evening at his shop.\n\"As a result, I have more customers this year,\" Mr Pahlajani said.\nBut with prices - gold is up 60% and silver 70% - shooting through the roof, jewellers are having to change tack to counter stagnant customer budgets.\n\"People are not saying 'I don't want to buy'. Instead, they are saying, 'I'll buy a little less,\" said Tanishq Gupta, another jeweller down the road from Mr Pahlajani's shop.\nHe said he's had to be innovative and design pieces that look elaborate but have a reduced quantity of gold in them. A coin made of 250mg gold, which he sells for as low as $35, is now thinner but made to look as big as the heavier ones.\nCoins weighing a tenth of that, at 25mg, are also on offer in the market.\nPushpinder Chauhan, another retailer in the area, said higher prices had also exacerbated the growing preference for lighter jewellery this year, \"especially among younger buyers\" who want pieces for everyday wear and not just special occasions.\nSeveral jewellers the BBC spoke to pointed to another clear trend - more customers were buying gold and silver for investment rather than jewellery this year, something that is also reflected in bullion market data.\nWhile gold jewellery continues to account for the largest share of India's overall gold demand, the proportion driven by investment - primarily bars and coins - has been rising steadily, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).\n\"Jewellery's share declined to 64% in the second quarter of this year, from 80% in the same period in 2023, while investment demand increased from 19% to 35% over the same period,\" Kavita Chacko, the council's research head, told the BBC.\nA lot of that demand is also being fed by investment in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or digital gold, where September marked record high inflows.\nETF assets under management have surged by over 70% this year.\nBesides retail demand, gold prices are also being significantly influenced by India's central bank, with the metal's share in its foreign exchange reserves rising from 9% to 14% in 2025, according to WGC.\nIn fact, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been \"a major pillar of global gold demand over the past three years\", said Kaynat Chainwala who tracks commodities at Kotak Securities, a broking house.\nShe said the RBI has been stocking up on gold in a bid to diversify its foreign exchange holdings, reduce its dependence on the dollar and provide stability during geopolitical stress.\nGoing forward, with the festive and the wedding season under way, retail demand for gold and silver is expected to continue to hold up despite record-high prices, say experts.\n\"The affluent classes will continue to buy, though it is a setback for lower income families,\" said Madan Sabnavis, the chief economist at the state-run Bank of Baroda. \"Demand will hold up in value terms, even though volumes will fall.\"\nBut some families have been totally priced out of the market.\n\"I am now having to think a lot while buying - about whether to even get something,\" Bhavna, who's getting married in February, told the BBC outside Mr Pahlajani's jewellery store.\nFor the moment, she's held off her purchases and is waiting for prices to fall a bit so that she can come back to finish her wedding shopping.\nSuch strong cultural affinity for physical gold, particularly jewellery, means the appetite for the noble metal is unlikely to be dented in the long term, despite the short-term moderation, say experts.\nThis is especially true for a country where high gold holdings have given solid long-term returns, making many Indians affluent at a time when growth is stumbling and jobs are hard to come by.\nAccording to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held a staggering $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's GDP.\n\"This implies a positive wealth effect on the household balance sheet, given the uptrend in gold prices,\" Economists Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir wrote in a recent note, adding that Indian families are also benefitting from \"cyclical factors of lower interest payments with monetary policy easing, and the positive impact on disposable income through direct and indirect tax cuts\".\nThat's not a bad start to the festive season, even though record prices may have taken some glitter off the precious metal.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "'We have to prioritise South Africans': Anti-migrant movement blocks foreigners from healthcare\nA community clinic just north of Johannesburg has become the frontline of a battle in South Africa over whether foreigners can access public health facilities.\nWhat started as a small local action in one area in 2022 has spread, with activists from the avowedly anti-migrant group, Operation Dudula, picketing some hospitals and clinics in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. They check identity cards and stop anyone who is not South African from entering.\n\"Dudula\" means to remove something by force in the Zulu language.\nDespite some arrests, the authorities seem unable to prevent the pickets.\nThe site of their latest campaign is in Dieplsoot – a poor township of more than 200,000 people near the country's commercial hub.\nOn a cool, spring Thursday morning, Sicelokuhle Moyo, dressed in a blue-and-beige skirt, thick windbreaker and a black headwrap, set out early for the clinic.\nThe Zimbabwean, who has lived in South Africa since 2006, was going there, as she often did, to collect her medication for a chronic condition.\nBut this time, when she reached the gate, things were different.\nTwo men wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"Operation Dudula – Mass Deportation\" were stationed at the entrance. They demanded that everyone produce their documents before being allowed inside.\n\"I said that I had a passport. They said, they don't take passports. They want IDs only,\" Ms Moyo said, hiding her frustration behind a polite smile.\nDespite this being a potential flashpoint, there was a strange calmness and resignation as people knew that Operation Dudula activists had been violent in the past.\nAnyone unable to produce a South African ID book was turned away.\nSlowly walking from the entrance, Ms Moyo joined a group of women by the roadside, young children tied to their backs, waiting with uncertainty for what would happen next.\nTendai Musvava, a woman in her 40s, faced the same fate.\n\"I was standing in the queue and then they said, they [only] need some people with IDs. Me, I don't have an ID. I have a passport, I am from Mozambique. So, I can't get my medication because I don't have an ID,\" she said.\nMs Musvava, dressed in a bright orange winter jumper and a white hat, appeared despondent.\n\"I just feel like they do what they want because it's their country. I don't have a say. For now I have to follow whatever they say. I don't have a choice.\"\nSouth Africa is home to about 2.4 million migrants, just less than 4% of the population, according to official figures. Most come from neighbouring countries such as Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, which have a history of providing migrant labour to their wealthy neighbour.\nXenophobia has long been an issue in South Africa which has been accompanied by occasional outbursts of deadly violence, and anti-migrant sentiment has become a key political talking-point.\nHaving started as a campaign, Operation Dudula, which has, at times, been accused of using force to make its point, is now a political party with ambitions to contest next year's local government elections.\nParty leader Zandile Dabula insists that what her organisation is doing at public clinics in Johannesburg and other parts of the country is justified.\n\"We want prioritisation of South Africans. Emergency care - we understand that you must be treated - but if you are illegal you must be handed over to the law enforcers,\" she told the BBC.\nWhen challenged with the fact that many migrants are in the country legally, she pivots to the argument that South Africans need to be prioritised because there are minimal resources.\n\"Life comes first, we don't deny that, but it cannot be a freebie for everyone. We cannot cater for the whole globe. We don't have enough.\"\nThe constitution guarantees the right to access healthcare for everyone in the country, regardless of nationality or immigration status.\nBut Ms Dabula says the public health system, which caters for almost 85% of the population, is overburdened.\nShe says that some people have to wake up at 04:00 to join long queues at their local clinic because they know that if they don't get there on time, there will be no medication left.\nSouth Africa is a profoundly unequal society, with much of the country's wealth held in only a few hands. Unemployment and poverty levels are high and migrants, who often live in poor communities, are blamed by some for the problems people find themselves in.\nOperation Dudula's methods have found a sympathetic hearing among some Diepsloot residents.\nOne of them, South African Sipho Mohale, described Operation Dudula's campaign as \"a positive change\".\n\"The previous time when I was here, the queue was very long. But this time around, it only took me a couple of minutes to get my stuff and get out,\" he said.\nAnother resident, Jennifer Shingange, also welcomed the activists' presence in Diepsloot.\n\"As South Africans, we would come to the clinic, only to find that the medication we need is not available. But since foreign nationals stopped using the clinic, there has been a difference,\" she said.\nIronically, some South Africans have not been spared from the anti-migrant campaign.\nThey too have been turned away from public health facilities because they could not produce an ID book – more than 10% of South Africans are thought not to have proper documents proving their nationality.\nBut it is the flouting of the constitution in Operation Dudula's actions that angers activists on the other side of the argument.\n\"To have a group that is not sanctioned by the state to make decisions about who gets in and who gets out is deeply problematic,\" said Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer from the organisation Health Justice Initiative.\n\"Unless government gets a handle on this situation quite soon, it's going to lose the ability to do law and order itself.\"\nDeputy Health Minister Joe Phaahla told the BBC that his government was against the targeting of foreign nationals or anyone else trying to use local clinics and hospitals.\n\"We don't agree with that approach because health is a human right. As much as we understand the fact that the provision of services must be properly organised, you don't organise it through bullying kind of methods,\" he told the BBC.\nSeveral major political parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters and the Democratic Alliance, have also condemned Operation Dudula.\nBut a recent attempt to take it to court by the South African Human Rights Commission failed on a technicality, effectively allowing the group to continue its campaign.\nSeveral Operation Dudula members have been arrested in recent weeks for blocking the entrances of public health facilities. They were later released with a warning. The police's action, however, does not appear to have deterred the group.\nMs Hassan believes that stronger action is required saying that \"the police and the military should have been there on day one to prevent [the picketing] because that is simply lawlessness\".\nDr Phaahla said this measure was being explored but the police have said resources are \"stretched in terms of being able to monitor and intervene timeously when such incidents occur\".\nWhile the state hesitates over what to do, Operation Dudula appears emboldened and is turning its attention to public schools, saying that it is part of a campaign to fight illegal immigration.\nBut in Diepsloot, the group's action leaves people without the medical help they need.\nMs Musvava, who was turned away, is now looking for alternatives. Despite her meagre resources, she is considering going to the private sector.\n\"I think I'll have to go to the doctor. I will pay the money. I will have to sacrifice to get it,\" she said.\nShe had no idea how much it would cost her.\n\"I don't have money, but I will have to make a plan.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

    "body": "Putin-Trump call a curveball for Zelensky ahead of White House meeting\nNews of the phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, in which they agreed to meet in person to discuss the war in Ukraine, will have come as an unwelcome surprise to Kyiv.\nThe country is being hit hard.\nThe last 24 hours alone have seen Russia launch dozens of missiles and more than 300 drones at multiple targets.\nOnce again, they include a large amount of civilian infrastructure with further damage to the country's gas supply network, just as the first signs of cold herald a long, hard winter ahead.\nAttacks on the electrical grid are already leading to nationwide power outages.\nFor Ukraine's government it's a sign of Russian desperation.\nThe frontlines are at effective stalemate, involving huge loss of life for incremental territorial gains.\nAnd the Russian economy is feeling the effects of the Ukrainian military's increasingly effective drone strikes on oil depots.\nSo, President Volodymyr Zelensky's big hope was for more American military assistance to keep up that pressure.\nBefore he boarded his plane to Washington, he seemed to believe that things were going his way.\nThere was optimistic talk about Trump beginning to see the world through Ukraine's eyes, a big shift from that angry, humiliating Oval Office exchange in February when he accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\".\nThe failure of the Trump-Putin Alaska summit in August and the intensifying bombardment of Ukraine were – it was thought – all causing the US president to lose patience with his \"good friend\", as he has called Putin.\nThere were high hopes that Friday's meeting would finally yield the prize Ukraine has been seeking - Trump's permission for the purchase of long-range Tomahawk missiles.\nTrump's frustration with Putin was obvious on Sunday when he told reporters: \"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so.\"\nBut how much of a game changer the missiles would really be is in much dispute among military experts and, with the complicated logistics, it could be months before they were deployed.\nBut at the very least they would add to Ukraine's ability to strike deep into the heart of Russia and with a much more powerful weapon than any it currently possesses.\nThey would also send a potent physical message to Putin about America's shifting allegiances.\nSo, the two-and-a-half-hour Trump-Putin phone call, that took place while Zelensky was in flight, somewhat steals a march on the Ukrainian president's big moment.\nSo far, though, he's putting something of a brave face on it, suggesting in a post sent on his arrival in Washington that Russia was panicking.\nThe Kremlin was \"rushing to renew dialogue\", he said, precisely because of all the talk of the Tomahawks.\nOther analysts will see less panic and more of a classic Putin play at work in the phone call, which was said by the Kremlin to have taken place at Russia's behest.\nThe issue of the Tomahawks was indeed discussed, with Putin reinforcing his view that their deployment would be seen as a significant act of provocation.\nThe two men apparently discussed the \"colossal prospects\" – in Russia's words – for trade if peace were achieved.\nAnd then they agreed to their summit in Hungary. That will probably happen within the next two weeks, Trump said.\nAs Ukraine faces its fourth winter of war, few people here had much belief in Trump's claim that he could turn his \"success\" in the Middle East into momentum towards peace in Ukraine.\nOne woman the BBC spoke to, badly injured in a Russian strike on a civilian railway carriage, shrugged her shoulders when we asked her if she saw an easy way out.\n\"A person like Putin can't be trusted,\" she said from her hospital bed.\nAfter touching down in Washington on Thursday evening, Zelensky met representatives of defence companies who produce the powerful weapons he says he needs to strengthen Ukraine's protection.\nHe will still ask the White House for the Tomahawks.\nBut Trump's willingness to give them was always in doubt and must, surely, be now further called into question.\nMeanwhile, Russia is being given something.\nA familiar pattern is developing. Every time Trump grows increasingly frustrated with Putin's intransigence over Ukraine he is then placated by a conversation with the Russian president.\nEach time they speak he seems to be persuaded of Putin's point of view and backs off his threats to apply tougher sanctions or supply more destructive weapons.\nThe Hungary summit, offered without concessions, doesn't look like much of a loss of American patience.\nNever mind the Tomahawks.\nFor now, Ukraine has been given a long-range curveball instead.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Five takeaways from NYC mayoral debate as Mamdani and Cuomo clash\nThe three leading candidates for New York City mayor took the stage at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan on Thursday to make a case to lead America's biggest city.\nThey tangled over housing, Israel and Gaza, and President Donald Trump, with frontrunner Zohran Mamdani pressing main competitor Andrew Cuomo during the heated two-hour debate.\nWith early voting set to begin next week, neither dominated the evening - though both declared victory afterwards. The most recent polling suggests Mamdani has widened his lead to 46%, while Cuomo stands at 33%.\nThe outcome could have political implications beyond the Empire State as Trump looms large, and whoever wins will likely face pressure from Washington in some form.\nThe Democratic Party nationally is likely watching to see if the America's biggest Democratic stronghold chooses an establishment, centrist figure in Cuomo - who is running as an independent - or the progressive Mamdani.\nRepublicans also will watch to see if their candidate, Curtis Sliwa, continues to make inroads with his public safety platform.\nHere are five big takeaways from the night.\n1. Mamdani pressed on views on Palestinians\nMamdani's past statements on Israel and Palestinians came up several times during the night in questions from moderators and opponents' criticisms.\nThe candidate has stressed his support for Palestinians and statehood, and has fiercely criticised Israel's military operation in Gaza.\nHe also was criticised by Cuomo for declining to condemn the phrase \"globalise the intifada\". Many Jews argue this slogan is an antisemitic call for violence, but pro-Palestinian activists say it refers to a call for international solidarity with Palestinians.\n\"Why wouldn't he condemn Hamas? Why wouldn't he condemn Hasan Piker?\" said Cuomo, referring to the left-wing political commentator and streamer, who once said \"America deserved 9/11\".\nIn response, Mamdani said: \"I want to be very clear; the occupation is a reference to international law and the violation of it.\"\nAnd he added that the comments by Mr Piker - who he sat with for an interview on Youtube earlier this year - \"objectionable and reprehensible\".\nPressed by moderators on whether he could reassure voters concerned about his past comments, Mamdani said he would seek to serve as a mayor for all New Yorkers, including its large and ideologically diverse Jewish population.\nBut Cuomo attacked Mamdani for his views, calling the New York state assemblyman a \"divisive personality across the board\".\n2. The fourth man: Donald Trump\nThere were three candidates at tonight's debate but a fourth name kept coming up: Donald Trump.\nThe president has implied he wants to send the National Guard into cities controlled by Democrats and has moved to withhold government funds for infrastructure projects in New York City.\nTrump has also prioritised the city for his mass deportation policy, and the mayor — who has little power over federal immigration enforcement — will likely have to weigh the city's response.\nSliwa, the Republican, noted that the mayor would need to get along with Trump regardless of political views. But Mamdani made his opposition to the president explicit from his very first response, promising to \"take on Trump\".\nCuomo, meanwhile, positioned himself as the only candidate experienced enough to deal with the current White House, warning \"it will be Mayor Trump\" if Mamdani is elected.\n\"I fought Donald Trump,\" he told voters. \"When I'm fighting for New York, I am not going to stop.\"\n3. Affordability front and centre\nAs large as Trump looms, the biggest policy issue around this mayoral election is affordability. New Yorkers face high costs of living on everything - especially rent and groceries.\nIn his opening statement, Sliwa acknowledged the \"really serious issues of affordability\" facing the city. He called for the next mayor to free up vacant apartments in NYCHA - New York's public housing programme — and allow people to move in.\nThe moderators directly asked each candidate how much they paid for rent, groceries and whether they paid off credit card debt monthly.\nThe candidates pitched a volley of proposals to tackle the cost of living, including Mamdani's plan to make buses free and Cuomo's proposal to place income limits on people who resided in rent-stabilised apartments.\nCuomo criticised Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilised apartment -a form of affordable housing - even though his parents are wealthy (his mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair).\nCuomo also opposed Mamdani's proposed rent freeze on stabilised apartments, saying it would only postpone future increases, force building owners into bankruptcy, and fail New Yorkers who don't live in rent-stabilised apartments.\n\"If you think that the problem in this city is that my rent is too low, vote for him,\" Mamdani said in response. \"If you know the problem in this city is that your rent is too high, vote for me.\"\n4. Cuomo's controversies still loom\nCuomo touted his decades of experience in office, rising from federal housing secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration to New York governor.\nHowever, controversies surrounding his governorship have shadowed his campaign. He resigned as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general found he had sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo apologised for acting \"in a way that made people feel uncomfortable\" but denied allegations.\nThe New York attorney general also investigated his administration for undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding he understated the actual number of deaths.\nMamdani attacked Cuomo on these matters, accusing him of \"sending seniors to their death in nursing homes\", and accused him of lacking integrity.\nCuomo said the allegations about harming seniors in nursing homes were \"totally false\".\n\"During Covid, everyone did whatever they could in this state, and there have been numerous investigations where they've gone through it, and they said we followed federal guidance,\" Cuomo said. \"But yes, people died during Covid. And my heart breaks for everyone that broken, that died in this state and across this nation.\"\nSliwa, too, attacked Cuomo for the \"lawsuits filed against you for sexual harassment\". The former governor rebutted that the case brought by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who investigated the misconduct claims, \"was political\".\n5. Curtis Sliwa makes his mark\nSliwa held his own as the only Republican on stage.\nHis voting bloc might be in the minority in New York City, but the 2024 presidential election revealed that residents prioritise public safety issues and Sliwa hammered that repeatedly. As the founder of the Guardian Angels, a New York City organization devoted to crime prevention, he seized the opportunity to connect with voters.\nThe longtime New York media and political personality knew how to make himself heard. He frequently interjected, telling moderators he wanted to speak, and elbowing his way into the debate's most heated moments. From centre stage, he took swings at both opponents in equal measure.\nHe felt confident after the debate, saying his night went \"extraordinarily well\" and likening his opponents to \"two kids in the schoolyard\".\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Salesforce CEO apologises for saying Trump should send troops to San Francisco\nSalesforce boss Marc Benioff apologised Friday for suggesting that US President Donald Trump should send National Guard troops to San Francisco.\nThe apology followed days of backlash against Mr Benioff for a comment he made ahead of his company's annual Dreamforce conference in the city.\n\"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans... I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,\" he said.\nThe saga comes amid the Trump administration's military deployments to US cities - many of which are led by Democrats. Trump on Friday asked the Supreme Court to overrule lower courts that blocked a National Guard deployment in Chicago.\nThe mood at the usually jubilant Dreamforce convention was dampened by cancelled appearances by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, as well as comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer.\nMr Benioff was dealt public rebukes from several Democratic politicians, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who once served as mayor of San Francisco and appeared on stage with Mr Benioff at last year's convention.\nOn Thursday, venture capitalist Ron Conway resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, telling the New York Times that their values \"were no longer aligned\".\n\"I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired,\" Conway told the newspaper.\nAlthough Mr Benioff walked back his comments earlier in the week, the apology posted on social media on Friday appeared aimed at putting the controversy to rest.\n\"I remain deeply grateful to Mayor Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully committed to a safer, stronger San Francisco,\" Mr Benioff said in his X post.\nBut he noted that his endorsement of a crackdown \"came from an abundance of caution\" around Dreamforce security, adding \"I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused\".\nSylvia Paull, a veteran Silicon Valley publicist, called Benioff \"typical\" of many tech CEOs who are not \"really political animals\" and tend to be transactional.\n\"It was going to hurt his sales.\"\nAnd that's not all.\n\"He's afraid he's going to lose his legacy,\" she said of his apology.\nMr Benioff, who also owns Time Magazine, has been a prolific donor to civic causes in San Francisco over the years.\nHis name graces one of the most prominent hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nIn 2018, he funded support for a San Francisco ballot measure aimed at raising corporate taxes to fund homeless services. It passed, despite controversy.\nAnd while he once held a fundraiser for Democratic Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign against Mr Trump, Mr Benioff appeared with the sitting president during his state visit to London last month.\nMr Trump said Wednesday that San Francisco was one of the next targets on his list of places where he plans to deploy the National Guard, calling the city \"a mess.\"\nOn Friday, in an emergency appeal, the president urged the Supreme Court to permit him to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago. Lower courts have blocked the deployment there thus far, with an appeals court saying such a move would \"likely to lead to civil unrest\" and \"only add fuel to the fire\".\nThe court ruled that it had \"seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois\".\nOfficials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump administration to block the deployment, arguing it was a \"grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty\".\nThe administration has recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon in a move that also prompted lawsuits and protests. It previously sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington and parts of Tennessee.\nThe New York Times also reported this week that Salesforce pitched its services to the Trump administration as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ramps up the hiring of new officers amid a crackdown on immigration.\nThe BBC has reached out to Salesforce for comment.\nTrump administration official David Sacks, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, addressed Mr Benioff in a post on X this week, writing \"if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Over the past year, Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control, mostly in the east of Ukraine, and have continued their recent barrage of air strikes on Kyiv and other cities.\nUS President Donald Trump says \"great progress\" was made during a phone call this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks in Hungary.\nFollowing President Zelensky's visit to Washington DC, here's a look at the situation on the ground in Ukraine.\nRussia grinds forward in the east\nIn eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - also known as the Donbas - surrounding and overwhelming villages and towns.\nIt has been trying to gain full control of the area along with two more regions to the west - Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Shortly after the invasion, Russia held referendums to try to annexe all these regions - in the same way it had annexed Crimea in 2014 - but it has never had them under full control.\nIt is believed that one of Putin's demands is that Kyiv surrenders the parts of the Donbas area it still controls.\nBut Zelensky has consistently said Ukraine will not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace, saying such a concession could be used as a springboard for future attacks by Russia.\nSummer offensive targets key towns\nA recent report by the US-based Institute for the Study of War, (ISW) describes a \"fortress belt\" running 50km (31 miles) through western Donetsk.\n\"Ukraine has spent the last 11 years pouring time, money, and effort into reinforcing the fortress belt and establishing significant defence industrial and defensive infrastructure,\" it writes.\nThe area also includes big cities that are still under Ukrainian control, including Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.\nA Russian summer offensive near the eastern town of Pokrovsk did make rapid advances just north of the town and Russia has recently made advances in the south of the town itself and to the east of nearby Kostyantynivka,\nHowever, analysts say it would take \"several years\" for it to complete its objective in the region.\nHowever, they also note that Russia's casualty rates have fallen in recent months despite its more rapid advances and say this is likely to be the result of its increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles - drones.\n- Why Donetsk 'fortress belt' matters so much for Ukraine's defences\n- Four key takeaways from Ukraine talks in Washington\n- Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?\nA drone attack on the village of Yarova slightly further north on 9 September killed more than 20 people queueing to collect their pensions, according to local officials, in one of the deadliest attacks on Ukrainian civilians in recent weeks.\nRussian incursion north of Kharkiv\nFurther north, Russia has been pushing towards Kupyansk in east of the Kharkiv region, as part of its efforts to capture the whole of Luhansk and encircle northern Donetsk.\nIts defence ministry has said that if it seizes Kupyansk it will use this as a foothold to make further advances into the Kharkiv region.\nAnd in addition to the eastern front, in May 2024 Russia began what the ISW describes as its \"subordinate main effort\", when it crossed the border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv.\nSeveral villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.\nRecent ISW analysis of the area shows Russia has advanced near Vovchansk and Lyptsi as it tries to create a buffer zone inside Ukraine's northern borders and get within artillery range of Kharkiv.\nPutin says he wants this buffer zone to protect Russia, after Ukrainian forces captured a swathe of territory further north in Kursk last summer. Russian forces eventually drove them out, with the help of North Korean troops.\nThe Russians then pushed on into Ukraine but quickly became bogged down in fighting over small border villages, which keep changing hands even today. Without major reinforcements, it is unlikely Russian troops will advance much further.\nAs well as the counter-offensive in the Kursk region, Ukraine has struck air bases deep inside Russia. One of these attacks involved using 100 drones to target nuclear-capable long-range bombers.\nThe Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur - but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled.\nKyiv claims the drone operation inflicted $7bn (£5.2bn) of damage to the Russian military. It hasn't been possible to verify either country's claims.\nMore recently Moscow blamed Ukrainian drones for a massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.\nAfter his most recent visit to Washington, Zelensky says there has been no progress in his push for long-range US Tomahawk missiles. He says both he and President Trump agreed not to make public statements on the issue because Washington \"does not want an escalation\".\nAs Zelensky arrived in the US for his third visit since January, he reacted to the news of this week's Trump-Putin phone call, saying Moscow was \"rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks\".\nHours before the call, Russia launched one of its largest attacks of the year on Ukraine, including 28 ballistic missiles, and 320 drones, according to Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna.\nStefanishyna said Russia launching overnight strikes on Ukraine before the call \"exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace\".\nRussia has also targeted Ukraine's rail infrastructure - a central pillar of Ukraine's war effort and a powerful national symbol of resilience - with multiple attacks in recent months.\nCeasefire talks\nSince Trump took office at the start of 2025, the US has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiations.\nTrump had been seen as more sympathetic to Russia than his predecessor Joe Biden, and strained relations with Zelensky came to a head on 28 February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office on live television.\nBut public relations with Zelensky have vastly improved in recent months.\nThere have been no major breakthrough in talks, and in late July, Trump set Putin a deadline of less than a fortnight to agree to a ceasefire or face sweeping sanctions, including measures against countries which still trade with Russia.\nBut he did not follow through the threat after Putin agreed to meet Trump in Alaska, which the US president hailed as a significant diplomatic success at the time, despite it not producing any tangible outcome.\nIn September, Trump signalled a major shift in his view of the conflict, saying he believed Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", a far cry from his public calls for Kyiv to cede territory occupied by Russia.\nFollowing his call with Putin, Trump told reporters he expected to meet Putin in Hungary \"within two weeks\".\nThree years of fighting\nRussia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.\nRussian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.\nRussian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.\nBut they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly-motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.\nUkrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.\nBy October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.\nSince then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months - military experts estimate between 165,000 and 235,000 Russian service personnel have been killed since the invasion.\nUkraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be an under-estimate.\nBy Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Paul Sargeant, Chris Clayton, Kady Wardell, Camilla Costa, Mark Bryson, Sana Dionysiou, Gerry Fletcher, Kate Gaynor and Erwan Rivault\nAbout these maps\nTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.\nThe situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.",

    "body": "Key Points\n- All links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable\n- Audiences need to be confident that our decisions on using links and feeds are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests\n- A link must never be included on the Public Service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.\n- An external site which is a candidate for a link should, generally, be relevant to the BBC content from which a link is envisaged and meet the expectations of the likely audience.\n- The producer must check the contents of the external site before adding a link to a BBC page.\n- BBC sites which cover matters of controversy or public policy may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject.\n- For programme support pages, an external link should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme's audience.\n- When linking to any commercial site, great care must be taken to avoid giving the impression that the BBC is endorsing a commercial product or service.\n- Links from individual pages on the Public Service site to the BBC's Commercial sites are acceptable only when clearly editorially justified.\n- It is likely to be editorially justifiable to link directly to the source of tickets if the event for which the tickets are being sold is a BBC Event. If not, a link to eg the band's own site would be editorially justifiable, from where a user can click to the ticket agency's site.\n- Pulling third party feeds onto BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive, because users expect the feeds to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards.\n- The person responsible for the page on which a feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed and should be prepared to remove links quickly, if necessary.\n- It should be clear to audiences whenever content is taken in from an external supplier.\n- Audiences should be able to easily report errors or inappropriate content.\n- It should be clear that an inbound embed (for example, of video from a social networking site) is not under the editorial control of the BBC and is not primarily the responsibility of the BBC. But editors are responsible for deciding what non-BBC content to embed on BBC pages and should be alert to the possibility of the original content being changed or removed and to rights issues.\nIntroduction\nThe BBC's global reputation is based on its editorial integrity and independence. Our audiences need to be confident that decisions are influenced neither by political or commercial pressures, nor by any personal interests.\nThe Editorial Guidelines state that:\n- BBC impartiality, editorial integrity and independence must not be compromised by outside interests and arrangements. The BBC must maintain independent editorial control over its content\n- The BBC must not give undue prominence to products, services or trade marks, though can refer to and credit them where editorially justified\n- BBC UK Public Services will not accept product placement, and must not endorse or promote any other organisation, products, services, trade marks, activities or opinions.\n- BBC Commercial Services must not promote products, services and trade marks in their content, but they can make reference to another organisation, its products, services, trade marks or activities as part of a commercial arrangement. If they do, they must follow the Guidelines on product placement, and on advertising and sponsorship on air and online credits must be clearly editorially justified\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 15 Independence from Commercial and other External Interests 15.4.22)\nLinks to External Sites\nWhenever producers are creating content on a BBC site, they should actively consider which external websites it may be editorially justifiable to link to.\nThis could be for\n- further relevant information\n- further background information or other key source material\n- useful practical information\n- further informed comment\nA link must never be included on the public service site or within the editorial content of a commercial site in return for cash, services or any other consideration in kind.\nAll links on the BBC Public Service site or on the editorial pages of a BBC Commercial site must be editorially justifiable and suitable for the intended audience – particularly children.\nLinks are not acceptable as a form of a credit.\nEditorial Checks\nProducers must check the contents of any site before adding a link to it on a BBC page, although responsibility for including the link lies with the relevant editor.\nThey should consider ways to enable users who find inappropriate external links to report them so that appropriate action can be taken.\nDisclaimers\nA standard disclaimer to the effect that \"the BBC is not responsible for the contents of any other sites listed\" should be added to any published list of links. If the links are to controversial or challenging material, it may be appropriate to add a specific disclaimer and more information, closer to the links. For \"in story\" links to such material, for example to very sensitive content it may be helpful to alert the user to this, in context, as part of telling the story.\nLinks to sites which do not share BBC editorial values\nContext is important in deciding whether a link is appropriate and it is often useful to explain why one is included. In some cases, a link may be offered to a site which does not share BBC editorial values, but which offers a useful insight - for example from a current affairs page to the site of a government-run national news agency so that the user can see the precise words used in a government statement.\nControversial content\nBBC sites which cover a controversial or public policy matter may offer links to external sites which, taken together, represent a reasonable range of views about the subject. When linking to third party sites any concerns about potential breaches of the law, for example, defamation or incitement to racial hatred should be considered.\nWhere content is likely to cause serious offence to some users and yet there is a strong editorial justification for covering the story, it may be editorially justifiable for the BBC to link to the relevant site rather than to host the content ourselves.\nCharities\nLinks to charity sites have to be based on appropriate editorial criteria. If one charity is in the news, it may be appropriate to establish a link to the site of that charity. But one charity should not be promoted above another. Where the links give advice or general information about a subject significant charities working in the field should be included. This guidance applies to online links offered by BBC Action Lines.\n(See Editorial Guidelines 15.4.28)\nIt is also important to consider where on the charity website we link to – for example it may be appropriate to link to useful sources of information, but not to campaigning or fundraising pages.\nProgramme Support\nFor programme support pages, an external linking should be justified by the relevance and value of the material to the programme's viewers and listeners. Links should be given to a reasonable range of relevant agencies.\nWhere a consumer programme reviews a product or service, links to the sites of the manufacturers, suppliers or retailers of any goods or services mentioned should only be offered where editorially justifiable\nUndue prominence\nThere must be no undue prominence of products, services or trade marks in BBC content.\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 15 Independence from Commercial and other External Interests 15.4.22)\nPublic Services must not endorse or promote any other organisation, or its products, services or trademarks, so great care must be taken when linking to any site in order not to give the impression that the BBC is doing so.\nBBC Public Service sites should not normally link direct to pages whose main purpose is transactional e.g. selling merchandise, downloads or tickets.\nThere may be exceptions for links to buy BBC-related programme content or to buy tickets for BBC Events. There are some occasions producers may also wish to link directly to a donations page for a BBC charitable appeal.\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 16: External Relationships, including Commercial Relationships, and Financing 16.4.49)\nIf in any doubt, refer to Editorial Policy.\nLinks from BBC Public Services to the BBC's commercial sites\nLinks from individual pages on the Public Service site to the BBC's Commercial sites must be editorially justified. They should not be seen to promote the BBC's Commercial sites in preference to other editorially relevant sites\nThere may be a justification for linking to BBC Commercial sites where they feature relevant branded products or other transactional purposes.\n(See Editorial Guidelines Section 15 Independence from Commercial and other External Interests 15.4.25-15.4.26)\nWhere appropriate, an interstitial page may appear on the user's journey between the Public Service site and the BBC's Commercial site. It will let users know that they are leaving the public service site and offer them a choice.\nLinks to buy tickets\nBBC programmes and sites regularly cover music concerts and tours. Linking policy to sites where users can buy tickets will depend on the nature of the event.\nIf it is a BBC mounted or run event (on the Public Services to contribute to the BBC's Mission and Public Purposes), then a direct link to the source of the tickets is likely to be editorially justifiable.\nIf it is not a BBC mounted or run event (and where for example a BBC network is simply broadcasting a concert organised by someone else) then a direct link to the relevant band's site is likely to be editorially justifiable, with one more click from there to the ticket agency's site.\nInbound Feeds and Embeds\nPulling third-party content onto BBC Online pages is more editorially sensitive than linking externally. Following an external link takes users away from the BBC site and users have a chance to adjust their expectations in the light of that journey. But as third party content sits with BBC content on BBC branded pages, users are more likely to expect it to have been through a rigorous editorial examination and to comply with BBC editorial standards before being published on our site.\nEditorial responsibility\nThe person who is editorially responsible for the page on which the feed or embed appears will be responsible for the content from that feed or embed. This principle will apply whether it is a bespoke feed to a single page or a general feed to many pages.\nThe BBC would not normally embed a live feed of video or text unless there was a contractual relationship with the supplier that provides assurances about the content or was otherwise confident that the content is appropriate to be shared on BBC platforms.\nTransparency\nThe BBC should be transparent about content that comes from an external supplier. Attribution should be as close as possible to the content in question.\nThere should be a clear and easy route for users to report a mistake or find offensive or inappropriate content on a feed.\nEmbeds\nEmbedded video, for example of a social networking site video player such as YouTube BBC page, may be a useful way to display editorially relevant non-BBC content.\nEven though the content is not under BBC control it appears to the audience that it is part of BBC online content. It should therefore be clear that the embedded video is from a third party site and give the audience a direct route to report any inappropriate content.",

    "body": "Prince Andrew gives up his title as Duke of York\nPrince Andrew is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, he has announced in a personal statement.\nHe has been under increasing pressure over his links with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with calls for Buckingham Palace to take action against him.\nThat now seems to have resulted in the prince deciding to voluntarily hand back his titles and to give up membership of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.\nIn his statement he said he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".\n\"In discussion with the King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" said a statement from Prince Andrew.\n\"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.\n\"I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\n\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"\nAndrew's decision to stop using his titles was made in consultation with William, Prince of Wales, as well as the King.\nHe will remain a prince - but will cease to be the Duke of York, a title received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth.\nAndrew had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.\nThe prince has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including a court case he settled with Virginia Giuffre, questions about his finances and his involvement with an alleged Chinese spy.\nHis ex-wife will be known as Sarah Ferguson and no longer Duchess of York, but their daughters will continue to have the title of princess.\nHe is expected to stay in his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, on which he has his own private lease which runs until 2078.\nPrince Andrew has faced intense scrutiny over his links with disgraced financier Epstein, more recently including questions about when he had really cut off contact.\nIn a now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019, Prince Andrew said that he had severed all links with Epstein after they had been photographed together in New York in December 2010.\nBut emails sent in February 2011 later emerged suggesting that he had privately stayed in touch with Epstein, including swapping a message: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\"\nThere had been growing frustration in Buckingham Palace at the scandals that continued to surround the prince.\nNext week a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, will be published, which is likely to cast further attention on Prince Andrew's involvement with her and Epstein.\nMs Giuffre claimed that she was one of many vulnerable girls and young women who had been sexually exploited by Epstein and his circle of wealthy connections.\nShe alleged that Andrew had sex with her at his friend Ghislaine Maxwell's house in London in 2001, when Ms Giuffre was 17 years old.\nHer memoir describes two other occasions on which she alleges she had sex with Andrew - in Epstein's townhouse in New York and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.\nPrince Andrew made a financial payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him. He denies all the accusations made against him.\nSpeaking to BBC Newsnight following the announcement that Andrew was giving up his titles, Sky Roberts, Ms Giuffre's brother, said the news had brought mixed emotions, but that his late sister \"would be very proud\" of the development.\n\"We have shed a lot of happy and sad tears today. I think happy because in a lot of ways this vindicates Virginia,\" Mr Roberts said.\n\"All the years of work that she put in is now coming to some sort of justice,\" he added.\nSky also called on the King to \"potentially go ahead and take out the 'Prince' in the Andrew.\"\nAlso speaking to BBC Newsnight, Epstein accuser Haley Robson said it was a \"bittersweet\" moment.\nMs Robson said Ms Giuffre \"started this fight and we're going to see it through\", adding that \"I really wish that she could have been here to see all of what she started\".\n\"Having him [Prince Andrew] step down and be stripped of his titles is something that is long delayed, and it is very appropriate, and kudos to King Charles,\" Ms Robson said.\nAndrew withdrew from Royal Family events last Christmas after an alleged Chinese spy who he was linked to was named in a High Court judgement.\nHis office said nothing sensitive had ever been discussed with Yang Tengbo, also known as Chris Yang, who became a close advisor on Andrew's business ventures.\nIn 2022, Andrew was repeatedly named in a court dispute between a Turkish millionaire and her former business adviser.\nThere were no suggestions of wrongdoing by the prince, but the court case highlighted the prince as receiving payments in a complex set of financial deals. A gift of £750,000 was returned to the Turkish millionaire by the prince.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "body": "US captures two survivors after attack on Venezuela 'drug sub'\nA US military attack on a ship allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela left two survivors who have reportedly been captured by US forces and are being held aboard a Navy ship.\nThe attack, which took place on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on Venezuelan ships in recent weeks. It was the first time that survivors have been reported.\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed the attack on Friday, calling the vessel a \"drug-carrying submarine\".\nTrump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".\nThe two survivors of the attack were rescued by a US military helicopter, and were then shuttled onto a US warship in the Caribbean, unnamed US officials have told US media.\nThe news of the survivors has not been officially confirmed by the US government.\nWhen asked about the survivors on Friday, Trump defended the ongoing attacks, which have so far killed around 27 people.\n\"We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs,\" the president told reporters at the White House.\n\"This was not an innocent group of people. I don't know too many people who have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug-carrying, loaded submarine.\"\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that the US attacks are targeting \"narco-terrorists\".\nBoth Trump and Rubio declined to address reports of survivors, but Rubio said that more information about the attack would be provided later on Friday.\nLittle is known about the groups that have been attacked, and the Trump administration has not provided additional details.\nUN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".\nOn Thursday, the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago said it was investigating whether two of its citizens had been killed in a US attack. Trinidad and Tobago are located only a few miles off the coast of Venezuela.\nVenezuela's UN Ambassador Samuel Moncada mourned the two killed, who were reportedly fishermen, and called for the UN Security Council to intervene.\n\"There is a killer prowling the Caribbean,\" Moncada said during a UN speech. \"People from different countries…are suffering the effects of these massacres.\"\nMaduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested, has appealed for peace with the US.\nThe increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. There are reportedly about 10,000 US forces built up in the Caribbean, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, a US territory. US Air Force B-52 bombers also circled over the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday for several hours.\nThis week, Trump told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.\nOn Friday, he used an expletive to warn Venezuela against undermining US interests.\nNarco-subs have been a growing trend in recent years. They have become a popular way to transport drugs as they can go largely undetected, and can be sunk after delivery. They are often homemade, constructed using fibreglass and plywood.\nSubs have been found carrying as much as three tonnes of cocaine, with destinations including the US and Europe.\nThe US, as well as other coastal nations, have previously intercepted some of these subs.",

    "body": "Customers sue over 'embarrassing' squeaky On Cloud shoes\nAthletic shoe company On is facing a lawsuit from US customers who claim that its popular sneakers make a \"noisy and embarrassing squeak\".\nThe \"CloudTec\" sneakers typically cost around $200 (£150) and have holes in the sole designed to make users feel like they are \"running on clouds\". Instead, the lawsuit says, they cause issues in daily life - especially for nurses who wear them all day.\n\"No reasonable consumer would purchase Defendant's shoes - or pay as much for them as they did - knowing each step creates an audible and noticeable squeak,\" the customers allege.\nThe company, which did not immediately respond to a BBC inquiry, has declined to comment on the allegations.\nThe class action lawsuit was filed on October 9 in US District Court in Oregon.\nThe customers say that multiple On sneaker styles are unwearable without \"significant DIY modifications\". They accused the company of \"deceptive marketing\".\nThe plaintiffs, who claim they were unable to return the shoes after complaining about the noise, are seeking refunds and other damages.\nThe Switzerland-based sneaker company could have \"fixed the design, and/or offered to fix the shoes or [given] consumers their money back but did none of those things\", the complaint alleges, citing the Cloudmonster and Cloudrunner models, among others.\nOne customer claimed in the complaint that she was \"no longer able to use her shoes as intended due to the embarrassment and annoyance\".\nThe plaintiffs in their complaint reference social media posts, on TikTok and Reddit, from other frustrated customers who have suggested at-home remedies for the noise - including applying coconut oil to the soles of the shoes.\nOn, which is backed by the tennis player Roger Federer, reported better-than-expected earnings in August. Its quarterly revenue was boosted by direct-to-consumer sales.\nEarlier this year, the company said sales of its Cloudmonster and Cloudsurfer sneaker models contributed \"significantly\" to its growth.",

    "body": "Reese Witherspoon on writing a thriller: 'What do girls in bikinis have to do with solving crime?'\nGrowing up, Reese Witherspoon's dad was a huge James Bond fan - which meant she also watched a lot of 007 films.\nBut she questioned why the girls all wore bikinis, with the young Reese asking herself what their revealing attire had to do with solving a crime.\nThe Oscar-winning actress - and now novelist - says that's why she wanted her new thriller to centre on a woman who has a unique skill, rather than being about her sex appeal.\nWitherspoon, 49, is best known for roles in Legally Blonde and The Morning Show, but has now written her first adult fiction book.\nGone Before Goodbye, co-written with bestselling author Harlan Coben, tells the story of a talented surgeon called Maggie, who is trapped in a deadly conspiracy.\nSpeaking exclusively to BBC News, she admits that part of her was worrying, \"Oh God, why did I do this?\" - but says she also felt excited to see her idea come to life.\n\"When Reese and I met and she gave me the idea, I was like, wow, that's good. We can do something with that,\" says Coben.\n\"And I immediately took out my legal pad and we started talking. Three hours back and forth.\n\"We just kept talking back and forward, taking notes, emails, texts, in person.\n\"Once we decided to do it, we both became completely obsessed with the idea of this novel.\"\nWitherspoon, who already runs an influential book club that's picked out hits like Where the Crawdads Sing, adds that she mainly cares about how other writers will receive it. \"I have so much reverence for authors,\" she says.\nWitherspoon was born in New Orleans to a medical doctor father and a mother who worked as a nurse.\nHer breakthrough role came with the 1999 teen drama Cruel Intentions, alongside her now-ex husband Ryan Phillippe.\nLegally Blonde, released in 2001, made her a major star, and was followed by roles including country singer June Carter Cash in Walk The Line, which earned her an Academy Award in 2006.\nWitherspoon says her parents' line of work helped inspire the characters in her new novel.\n\"I grew up in a medical military family and I grew up on a military base, so I was surrounded by other mums and dads who were medical military people,\" she says.\n\"There was this sense of service, and that what they were doing was an important service to humanity, but also to their country.\"\n\"We both have the viewpoint that doctors are heroic,\" adds Coben, who is married to a paediatrician. \"They really are. I mean, it's a cool profession.\"\nCoben says they both hoped the lead character Maggie felt \"real to people\".\n\"We really wanted to write a great thriller,\" he said. \"We want this book, you take to bed at 11 o'clock at night, think you can read for 10 minutes, next thing you know it's three or four in the morning.\n\"And you're deliriously happy and you have that wonderful feeling when you're totally immersed in a book.\n\"I love that feeling. And I know Reese loves that.\"\nIn the book, Maggie has lost her medical licence after a series of tragedies, but is thrown a lifeline by a former colleague.\nThe theme of career setbacks is familiar to Witherspoon, who starred a string of poorly received films in the years after her Oscar win and her 2008 divorce from Phillippe, with whom she shares two children.\nIn 2014, she opened up in an interview about how her marriage breakdown affected her career.\n\"You can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs,\" she told CBS's 60 Minutes. \"I was just kind of floundering career-wise. I wasn't making things I was passionate about.\"\nAsked whether her personal experience of a career setback inspired her book's plotline, Witherspoon says: \"I think every great story has a character who is taken to their knees. We just happen to start the story with her on her knees.\"\nIt was \"a great place to start\" the book, she adds, \"because it can really only go up from there\".\nWitherspoon's acting career has bounced back. And through her production company Hello Sunshine, she has made a point of celebrating strong female characters through films and TV series including The Morning Show and Big Little Lies, which she produced and starred in.\n'Skills more important than sex and violence'\nI ask Witherspoon how rare it is to see a female character like Maggie, who is not about her sex appeal but rather about her particular skill.\n\"Growing up, I always saw James Bond movies, my dad was obsessed with them, but I was like, why are [the girls] all in bikinis, and I don't understand what that's got to do with solving the crime,\" she replies.\n\"If I was going to do a thriller, I wanted the woman to be at the centre of it. I wanted her to have a unique skillset everybody in the world wanted, but she didn't even realise it, and that she doesn't have to shoot guns or punch bad guys. She's actually just very smart and very intuitive and an incredible surgeon.\"\nBut the film industry still has further to go in creating such roles for women, Witherspoon suggests.\nWhen I ask whether Hollywood still suffers from a lack of strong female leads, the A-lister says: \"I always see the gap, I see the white space.\n\"I started Hello Sunshine in 2011 because I just wasn't seeing complex storytelling for women in the movie space.\n\"So, in a way, I was just taking the relationships I've had from 30 years of being an actor and just helping shine a light on women who were ready for those opportunities.\"\nEntertainment journalist Lauren Morris believes Witherspoon has been \"quite clever\" in the way she's built her business empire.\n\"She has her book club, where she publicises books, often centring female stories. Then she has her production company, where she adapts it for TV or film, and she often stars in it herself too,\" she says.\n\"It's a good business model and it's working well for her.\"\n'I'm really enjoying this moment'\nCelebrity novels have been all the rage in recent years, with stars such as Keanu Reeves and Millie Bobby Brown among those releasing books.\nOften, collaborations involve a ghostwriter or co-author who does the majority of the writing, with minimal input from the celebrity. Reeves admitted as much to BBC News last year, when he said his novel had been mostly written by British science fiction author China Miéville.\nBut both Witherspoon and Coben insist that wasn't the case for them. Witherspoon originally brought the idea to Coben, and the pair say they were both involved in the writing, to the point that - according to Witherspoon - \"we couldn't figure out who wrote what\".\nA number of Coben's books have recently been adapted for the small screen, with mystery thriller Fool Me Once becoming one of Netflix's most-watched dramas last year.\nSo will Gone Before Goodbye get the same treatment? For Coben, the answer is yes.\n\"I think one day it'll be adapted. I think I have somebody in mind who I think would like to play Maggie, but I'm not going to say anything,\" he says.\nIs he thinking about Witherspoon by any chance? He laughs. \"Yeah.\"\nI ask Witherspoon whether she sees herself in Maggie.\n\"Every character I play is some part of my personality,\" she responds. \"My personality is a big pie. Each character is a piece of the pie.\"\nSo, having conquered film, TV, book clubs and now novels, what's next?\n\"Wow, when you put it like that, I want to lie down,\" Witherspoon laughs.\n\"I'm just really enjoying this moment. This is a big new frontier for me. And it just made me feel like, gosh, creativity doesn't stop at any one age. It just goes on and on.\"\nGone Before Goodbye is published on 23 October in the UK.",

    "body": "After all those scandals, why did Andrew quit his titles now?\nAfter so many scandals, Prince Andrew has given up the use of his titles and honours.\nHe can no longer sign off as the Duke of York, or put \"KG\", a Knight of the Garter, after his name, with a flourish of medieval chivalry.\nThe Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh are also scratched off his list of titles, with \"Andrew Inverness\" a name he'd sometimes used in his business dealings.\nBut what's caused this sudden announcement? Particularly as this dramatic move, removing the remaining vestiges of his royal life, comes with an assertion of his innocence and that he continued to \"vigorously deny the accusations against me\".\nPrince Andrew has voluntarily given up the use of his titles - but he was clearly under pressure to jump before he was pushed.\nThis way, the changes in his status are kept in-house and there doesn't have to be the intervention of Parliament, which would have needed to legislate to take away his title as Duke of York.\nThat would have been messy, but the Palace was already sending signals it was prepared to take action, and it was confident that Parliament, and popular opinion, would have supported such a change.\nAllowing Andrew to voluntarily give up his titles, which theoretically remain in place, gave him a way out, still holding on to a little of the disappearing vapour trail of his pride.\nBut it's no secret that Buckingham Palace was exasperated with the scandals surrounding Prince Andrew and what a royal source calls the \"constant parade of headlines\".\nHe was one of their \"Dukes of Hazard\" that kept making news for all the wrong reasons.\nQuestions about Andrew's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were drowning out the work of the rest of the Royal Family. That was on top of unanswered questions about Andrew's finances and his connections to an alleged Chinese spy.\nNext week will see an historic state visit by the King and Queen to meet Pope Leo at the Vatican, and there was a deep irritation that such a solemn occasion was going to be overshadowed by lurid stories about Andrew and Epstein.\nAccording to royal sources, a \"tipping point\" had been reached and something had to be done.\nArguably that should have happened earlier. But that would also have meant the Palace publicly accepting that it had a responsibility for Prince Andrew, when it had so long argued that as a \"non-working royal\", his problems were his own to resolve.\nBut this latest move shows a recognition that even if Andrew isn't a royal responsibility, it's still their reputation he's been damaging.\nWhat added to the sense of this no longer being a tenable position was an email published last weekend that showed Prince Andrew had stayed in touch with Epstein longer than he had claimed in his BBC Newsnight interview.\nA royal source said this was a significantly different moment when there were such clear \"fault lines\" exposed in Prince Andrew's version of events.\nCuriously, the same email had been partially published in January - again showing that Andrew had not cut ties to Epstein when he had claimed - but this time in October the impact has been like the pebble that has started an avalanche.\nIt followed a similar awkwardness for Sarah Ferguson, where a private email contradicted her own public claims to have cut links with Epstein.\nAnd it added to the pressure from extracts published from a posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein victim who had reached a financial settlement with Prince Andrew, and had earlier this year taken her own life.\nMs Giuffre's memoir, to be published next week, once again casts Andrew into toxic associations with Epstein.\nAnd the book's accusation that Prince Andrew was \"entitled\" echoed the title of a recent biography of Prince Andrew, by Andrew Lownie, that took another wrecking ball to his reputation.\nIt's been a landslide of bad news, month after month, that showed no sign of losing momentum. He'd become the disastrous football manager, or the damaged political leader, who had no obvious way of being removed. Particularly when it was like a football manager whose brother was the chairman.\nThere's always a tension between protecting an institution and a reluctance to remove the individuals within it. Even more so when the institution is also a family. It's where the Godfather movies meet the Crown.\nBut something had to be done, and in the end, Andrew has handed back the keys to his royal life and walked away.\nMore could still emerge in the United States in the trawling of documents related to Epstein.\nOminously for Prince Andrew, among those quick to respond on Friday evening was the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee that has been pushing for the release of Epstein material.\nRobert Garcia, whose colleagues recently revealed documents showing an \"Andrew\" getting massages on Epstein's private jet, said: \"His decision to give up his royal titles is long overdue.\"\n\"We know rich and powerful men used their money and power to abuse girls and young women, and to shield themselves from justice. Prince Andrew's decision is just the beginning in the committee's work to deliver justice for the survivors.\"\nPrince Andrew has always denied wrongdoing but this has become a global story.\nWhen US President Trump arrived for his state visit, it was a picture of Andrew and Epstein that protesters projected on to the walls of Windsor Castle.\nPrince Andrew's decision to step away from his remaining titles will also mean he stays in step with his ex-wife, who is no longer the Duchess of York. They are back to where they began when they first met - as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.\nThey still live together and as Prince Andrew has his own long lease on Royal Lodge, they'll carry on there as before. The King had already financially cut off Prince Andrew, so there isn't any change there, he'll have to find his own funding.\nBut by voluntarily stepping back, rather than being stripped of their honours, it means that their daughters will carry on with the titles of princess.\nPrince Andrew won't be at the royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham this year. And the guessing game about seeing him at the Order of the Garter parade won't happen again.\nBut are the questions about his conduct really over?\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "body": "How CIA deployment gives Trump no 'limitations' on Venezuela action\nUS President Donald Trump has acknowledged that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela - a highly unusual admission of what is normally a highly sensitive and tightly guarded state secret.\nThe authorisation - more typically known as a presidential finding - could give the agency broad leeway to conduct operations in the region, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or broader operations aimed at destabilising or toppling the regime of Nicolás Maduro.\nPrevious presidential findings have ultimately led to drone strikes on militants overseas, money and weapons funnelled to insurgencies, and even efforts at full regime change.\nMost, however, remain classified.\nAccording to US law, presidents may authorise covert actions if they determine that these operations are \"necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives...[and] important to the national security of the United States\".\nOnce that determination is made, it must be shared with the House and Senate intelligence committees, and, in some sensitive cases, the \"gang of eight\" composed of leaders in both parties and the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees.\nBut that notification - which is expected to be detailed and outline legal risks - does not mean congressional approval is necessary. Congress can only block these operations through legislation, or by cutting funding.\nIn practice, the authorisation could be as focused - or as broad - as the president deems necessary.\n\"The parameters of the authorities are laid out in the finding,\" explained Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and deputy under secretary of defence. \"But there really isn't any limitations, and it does not need congressional approval.\"\nAny restrictions imposed on the CIA's activities are executive orders, which Mr Mulroy said \"means the president can simply write a new executive order and change it\".\nOnce approved by the president, CIA actions could take the form of targeted killings, covert influence operations, shaping local politics or helping set up and equip armed rebel movements fighting foreign governments.\nIn December 1979, for example, a presidential finding from Jimmy Carter allowed the CIA to deliver lethal aid to Afghan guerrillas fighting the Soviet invasion of the country.\nJust a few years later, another finding - this time from President Ronald Reagan administration - allowed the CIA to extend covert aid to the Contras, rebel groups that were trying to unseat the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\nMore recent findings led to worldwide operations against al-Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks, as well as Operation Timber Sycamore, a CIA-run operation to train and supply Syrian rebels fighting the Assad regime.\nIn other countries across Latin America - including Guatemala, Chile and Brazil - the US helped overthrow governments in the name of fighting communism, or helped bolster regimes that were harsh oppressors of human rights.\n\"We just don't have a great track record,\" said Dexter Ingram, the former director for combating violent extremism at the State Department and now an advisory council member at the International Spy Museum in Washington.\n\"There's a long history, and it's not always positive,\" Mr Ingram added. \"I think we have to look at our history....it's a slippery slope.\"\nIt remains unclear whether the CIA is already conducting covert actions in Venezuela, is planning to, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies.\nTrump earlier this week justified the CIA authorisation, and US airstrikes against vessels in the Caribbean, by saying that \"a lot of drugs\" are flowing from Venezuela to the US.\nCIA operations, though, would be covert and could take various different forms against an array of targets.\nSuspected members of Tren de Aragua and the Cartel of the Suns, both of which the US has designated terrorist organisations, could be struck in paramilitary operations or by drones.\nMarc Polymeropoulos, a 26-year veteran of the CIA who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan and oversaw clandestine missions around the world, told the BBC that the methodology of \"find, fix and finish\" the agency developed during the \"global war on terror\" could be readily applied to criminal networks.\n\"It's going after certain individuals, networks, or supply chains,\" he said. \"It's manhunting, and there's nobody better on the planet at that than the CIA.\"\nThe primary difference between striking criminals in Venezuela and striking Al Qaeda or other militant targets in places like Syria, Yemen or tribal areas of Pakistan, he added, is that the latter targets mostly operated in \"ungoverned\" spaces.\n\"Conceptually, it would be a little different. Those were really lawless countries,\" he said. \"This would obviously be done without the cooperation of the Venezuelan [government].\"\nAlternatively - or additionally - sabotage operations could be conducted against targets aligned to Maduro's government, \"influence operations\" could be used to shift public opinion through media and money, training and weapons could be provided to anti-Maduro groups - all operations with historical precedent for the CIA in Latin America and elsewhere.\n\"Nobody knows what this [authorisation] is,\" Mr Polymeropoulos added. \"There's a million different questions.\"",

    "body": "Government 'doing everything' to overturn Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban\nThe government has said it is \"doing everything in our power\" to overturn a ban on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans attending a football match in Birmingham and is exploring what additional resources could be required.\nOn Thursday, Aston Villa said the city's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) decided that fans of the Israeli club should not be permitted to attend the Europa League fixture on 6 November over safety concerns.\nFacing mounting pressure to resolve the situation, the government said it was working with police and exploring what additional resources are required.\nA meeting of the SAG to discuss the match is expected next week, the Home Office said.\n\"No one should be stopped from watching a football game simply because of who they are,\" a government spokesperson said.\nThey added the government was working with police and other bodies to ensure the game could \"safely go ahead with all fans present\".\nAfter it was announced on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer called the move to block fans attending \"wrong\", adding \"we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets\". There has also been criticism from other party leaders.\nThe SAG, which advises the council on whether to issue safety certificates, will review the decision if West Midlands Police changes its risk assessment for the match, Birmingham City Council said.\nOn Thursday, West Midlands Police said it had classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including \"violent clashes and hate crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024.\nMore than 60 people were arrested over the violence, which city officials described as a \"toxic combination of antisemitism, hooliganism, and anger\" over the war in Gaza, Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East.\nThe Home Office was briefed that restrictions on visiting fans might be imposed last week, but the BBC understands officials were not informed about the final decision until Thursday.\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the revelation left the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, with \"serious questions to answer\" about why her department did \"nothing\" to avert the ban.\nShe said: \"This is a weak government that fails to act when required.\"\nA source close to Mahmood told the BBC that \"this is categorically untrue\".\n\"The first time the home secretary knew that the fans were being banned was last night,\" they added.\nThe decision has also been criticised by the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK, as well as Israeli government officials.\nBut the Green Party backed the decision, saying it was \"irresponsible\" for Starmer to question a local authority's safety decision.\nAyoub Khan, an independent MP for Birmingham Perry Barr who campaigned on a pro-Gaza platform in last year's general election, said the decision to ban fans was a \"moral question\" and not just about public safety.\nSpeaking on BBC's Politics Midlands, Khan said the rules applied to \"Russian football teams which have been banned from European competitions because of their atrocities in Ukraine\" should also \"apply with Israeli football teams\".\nKhan, who has also raised concerns about safety and public order, said that even if additional resources were provided to West Midlands Police, the fans should not be allowed to attend, citing last year's violence in Amsterdam.\nEmily Damari, a British-Israeli citizen who was held hostage in Gaza and released in January, said she was \"shocked to my core with this outrageous decision\".\nMs Damari, who described herself as a \"die-hard fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv\", said: \"Football is a way of bringing people together irrespective of their faith, colour or religion and this disgusting decision does the exact opposite.\"\nSeveral sporting events have seen protests over the war in Gaza, including in recent World Cup qualifiers.\nEarlier this month, 22 people were arrested near the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo when Israel's national team played Norway. Reports said tear gas was used after several demonstrators broke through police barriers.\nA few days later, Israel's national team played its next qualifier against Italy in the northern city of Udine, where around 5,000 protesters took part in a march ahead of the game. Clashes with police broke out, with a number of people arrested.\nIn Spain on Wednesday, a protest over Euroleague's basketball game between Valencia and Hapoel Tel Aviv saw several people arrested.",

Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and Professor Stephen Hawking have been shared widely online.\nIt led Zelda Williams, the daughter of Robin Williams, to ask people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father, the celebrated US actor and comic who died in 2014.\nBernice A. King, the daughter of the late Dr King, later made a similar public plea, writing online: \"I concur concerning my father. Please stop.\"\nAmong the AI-generated videos depicting the civil rights campaigner were some editing his infamous \"I Have a Dream\" speech in various ways, with the Washington Post reporting one clip showed him making racist noises.\nMeanwhile others shared on the Sora app and across social media showed figures resembling Dr King and fellow civil rights campaigner Malcolm X fighting one another.\nAllow X content?\nAI ethicist and author Olivia Gambelin told the BBC OpenAI limiting further use of Dr King's image was \"a good step forward\".\nBut she said the company should have put measures in place from the start - rather than take a \"trial and error by firehose\" approach to rolling out such technology.\nShe said the ability to create deepfakes of deceased historical figures did not just speak to a \"lack of respect\" towards them, but also posed further dangers for people's understanding of real and fake content.\n\"It plays too closely with trying to rewrite aspects of history,\" she said.\n'Free speech interests'\nThe rise of deepfakes - videos which have been altered using AI tools or other tech to show someone speaking or behaving in a way they did not - have sparked concerns they could be used to spread disinformation, discrimination or abuse.\nOpenAI said on Friday while it believed there were \"strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures\", they and their families should have control over their likenesses.\n\"Authorised representatives or estate owners can request that their likeness not be used in Sora cameos,\" it said.\nGenerative AI expert Henry Ajder said this approach, while positive, \"raises questions about who gets protection from synthetic resurrection and who doesn't\".\n\"King's estate rightfully raised this with OpenAI, but many deceased individuals don't have well known and well resourced estates to represent them,\" he said.\n\"Ultimately, I think we want to avoid a situation where unless we're very famous, society accepts that after we die there is a free-for-all over how we continue to be represented.\"\nOpenAI told the BBC in a statement in early October it had built \"multiple layers of protection to prevent misuse\".\nAnd it said it was in \"direct dialogue with public figures and content owners to gather feedback on what controls they want\" with a view to reflecting this in subsequent changes.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "body": "Chinese Communist Party expels top generals in sweeping military crackdown\nThe Chinese Communist Party has expelled nine top generals in one of its largest public crackdowns on the military in decades.\nNine men were suspected of serious financial crimes, a statement released by China's defence ministry said.\nMost of them were three-star generals and part of the party's decision-making Central Committee. They have also been expelled from the military.\nWhile the statement cast the expulsion as part of an anti-corruption drive, analysts say it could also be seen as a political purge. It comes on the eve of the party's plenum where the Central Committee will discuss the country's economic development plan and vote in new members.\nThe nine officials are:\n- He Weidong - Vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC)\n- Miao Hua - director of the CMC's political work department\n- He Hongjun - executive deputy director of the CMC's political work department\n- Wang Xiubin - executive deputy director of the CMC's joint operations command centre\n- Lin Xiangyang - Eastern Theatre commander\n- Qin Shutong - the Army's political commissar\n- Yuan Huazhi - the Navy's political commissar\n- Wang Houbin - Rocket Forces commander\n- Wang Chunning - Armed Police Force commander\nOf these nine, He Weidong was considered the most prominent as the second highest ranking official in China's military, after President Xi Jinping who is the chairman of the CMC.\nHe Weidong was last seen in March, and his long absence from public view fuelled speculation that he was under investigation as part of a purge of the military's top brass.\nHe was also part of the Politburo, the Communist Party's apex decision-making body, making him the first Politburo serving member to be investigated.\nThe defence ministry statement said that the nine men had \"seriously violated party discipline and were suspected of serious duty-related crimes involving an extremely large amount of money, of extremely serious nature, and with extremely detrimental consequences\".\nIt added that the men now face military prosecution, and said their punishment was a \"significant achievement in the party and military's anti-corruption campaign\".\nThe CMC has signalled for months it would conduct a crackdown, issuing new guidelines in July calling for the elimination of \"toxic influence\" in the military and listing out \"iron rules\" for cadres.\nThe crackdown follows smaller-scale public purges of other military officials in recent years, including former defence ministers Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu.\nTop generals within the Rocket Forces were also removed. One of their replacements was Wang Houbin - one of the nine officials now expelled from the party.\nCivilian office-holders have also not been spared, most notably with the disappearance of foreign minister Qin Gang in 2023. The man who was then tipped to replace him, Liu Jianchao, has not been seen since July.\nNeil Thomas, a fellow in Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told BBC Chinese that Xi's purges are meant to project strength.\n\"In his view, cutting out corrupt or disloyal cadres is the Party's 'self-revolution' to become a clean, disciplined, and effective organisation that is capable of ruling indefinitely.\"\nBut, he noted, purges can also chill initiative and make governance more rigid. \"This is the price of Xi's power: the system gets cleaner and more obedient, but also more cautious—and at times, more brittle.\"\nMany will now be watching to see who attends the upcoming Fourth Plenum due to begin on 20 October. \"If attendance plunges, it's the clearest public signal yet of how extensive the purges have been,\" said Thomas.\nAdditional reporting by Ian Tang of BBC Monitoring.",

At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.\nThe proposed complex would include offices, a large basement area, housing for 200 staff, and a new tunnel to connect the Embassy House to a separate building on the embassy grounds.\nThe pending decision on whether to approve the new embassy has attracted close scrutiny because of concerns about the security implications of the plan, including the location, size and design of the building.\nThere are concerns held by some opponents that the site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into nearby fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.\nBlanked out plans\nThe government's first delay was requested by then housing secretary Angela Rayner, after she asked China to explain why some rooms within its planning documents had been blanked out for \"security reasons\".\nPlanning consultants working for the Chinese embassy had replied that China \"does not consider that, as a matter of principle, it is necessary or appropriate to provide full internal layout plans\".\nRayner had written back to groups involved in the consultation, including China, the Met police and a local residents' association, to give them more time to respond to the plans and putting the deadline back to 21 October.\nSteve Reed, who took over the housing role following Rayner's resignation last month, then requested a further delay to 10 December.\nIn the latest correspondence, the housing department said it was unable to set a new deadline for fresh comments until it receives pending responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office.\nThe two departments wrote jointly to Rayner in August to say they were still in discussions with China over consolidating the country's existing diplomatic premises in the capital into the new complex.\nThe departments requested that Rayner should not make a final decision until a \"firm plan is agreed\".\nSir Keir Starmer said last year that Chinese President Xi Jinping had raised the embassy issue during their first leaders' phone call in August.\nSpeaking in November, the prime minister told China's leader \"you raised the Chinese embassy building when we spoke on the telephone, and we have since taken action by calling in that application\".\n\"Now we have to follow the legal process and timeline,\" Sir Keir added.\nThe Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have urged the government to throw out China's application.",

Nothing.\"\nThe parent says that a soldier \"opened fire erratically\" from the back of a car. Muhammad was shot in the pelvis and rushed by car to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.\nFootage shared on social media shows a large crowd gathered around an ambulance as the body of Muhammad was driven back to his village in the dark. His parents kissed his face as he lay on a stretcher.\nLater Muhammad's body was carried off for burial.\nIn a video on Palestinian Maan news agency, his mother said that he had spent the day at school and had been showing off his new backpack before going out.\n\"He loved birds, and he told me he wanted to be a heart doctor, he used to say this all the time,\" she said tearfully, adding that he always got 'excellent' in his school grades.\nThe Israeli army said: \"IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers responded with fire toward the suspects in the rock-hurling. Hits were identified. No IDF injuries were reported, and the incident is under review.\"\nIsrael's Kan news website said that a preliminary investigation by the IDF battalion commander criticised the soldiers' conduct. According to its report, the commander found \"the shooting deviated from the rules of engagement, and there was improper use of weaponry, with an emphasis on crowd-control measures.\"\n\"This is the second incident in the company in which shooting was carried out not in accordance with the rules of engagement,\" the commander is quoted as saying.\nThe BBC asked the IDF about the Kan report, but it declined to comment.\nSeparately the army said on Thursday that it had killed a man in Qabatiya near Jenin in the north of the West Bank, saying he had thrown an explosive device at Israeli troops who were not hurt.\nThe official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, identified the man as Mahdi Kmeil who was 20 and said that he had been shot dead during an Israeli military raid.\nAccording to figures from the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), some 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the year, including about 40 children.",

    "body": "How nervous are investors about the stock market?\nEvery week it seems US financial markets are hit by another bout of fear.\nThe latest worries spread this week from the banking sector in the US, after two regional lenders warned they would be hit by losses from alleged fraud.\nBut before that, markets swooned over signs of rekindled US-China tensions, as the two superpowers face off over tariffs, advanced technology and access to rare earths.\nThe bankruptcies of car parts supplier First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor acted as a trigger for nervous chatter in September.\nOver the last month, US shares, which had been climbing since their tariff-induced rout in April, have flattened.\nBut in many ways the market swings so far - down roughly 3% at the steepest - are not unusual.\nZooming out, the major indexes have still posted gains since the start of the year, with the S&P 500 up roughly 13%. That's smaller than 2024 but still solid.\n\"The market has done surprisingly well so far this year ... driven by an improvement in corporate profits and the enthusiasm surrounding AI,\" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\nThe resilience of the stock market is, ironically, exactly what is driving some of the jitters.\nPut simply, when set against other standard metrics like profits, share prices in the US are very high.\nMeanwhile, concerns about a possible bubble emerging in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry have generated a steady undercurrent of talk since the start of the year - discussions that have ramped up as analysts struggle to see how the vast sums of money the biggest players are throwing at one another all fit together.\nThe Bank of England warned recently of \"stretched valuations\" and rising risk of a \"sharp market correction\".\nThose concerns were echoed in remarks from JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon and to some extent US central bank chair Jerome Powell.\nThe International Monetary Fund was the latest to chime in this week.\n\"Markets appear complacent as the ground shifts,\" it said in its financial stability report, which noted risks from trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty and rising sovereign indebtedness.\nJames Reilley, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, said the market falls triggered by the regional banks were a sign of investors alert to risk and moving quickly to reduce exposure amid uncertainty about whether the losses were indicative of wider issues.\nBut he said the brief nature of the drops showed how quickly such worries could clear.\nMany investors remain optimistic, with analysts at firms such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in recent weeks boosting their forecasts for where the S&P 500 might climb by the end of the year.\nDavid Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said he thought a sharp sell-off was unlikely at a time when growth in the US remains solid and the US central bank is lowering borrowing costs.\nHe is expecting the S&P 500 to end the year hovering around 6,900 points, about 4% higher than where it sits on Friday.\nWhile he acknowledged the troubles popping up at banks, he noted that the lenders involved have alleged fraud.\nHe said the overall picture, when looking at default levels, appears healthy, and he saw little risk that demand for AI would suddenly decline, puncturing valuations.\n\"I'm not saying we're in a bubble. I'm not saying we're not in a bubble. The question is what's going to drive the downside,\" he said. \"Things don't usually spontaneously decline.\"\nA typical bull market - when shares are rising - lasts about four and a half years, said Mr Stovall.\nWith inflation still sticky, and investors wary of events in Washington, like the government shutdown and Trump administration's efforts to influence the US central bank, this year's market rally has been \"unloved\", said Mr Stovall.\nOn the other hand, he noted: \"It's just a matter of time. Corrections and bear markets have not been repealed. They might simply be delayed.\"",

    "body": "Lamborghini swerves away from all-electric future\nThe boss of Lamborghini has said its customers still want \"the sound and the emotion\" of internal combustion engines, and the company will use them in its cars for at least the next decade.\nSpeaking to the BBC at the Italian supercar-maker's London showroom, chief executive Stephan Winkelmann said enthusiasm for electric cars was declining - creating an opportunity to focus on hybrid power instead.\nLamborghini will decide in the next month whether a long-planned new model, the Lanzador, will be all-electric, or merely a plug-in hybrid, he said.\nMr Winkelmann insisted the business was socially responsible, but added that as a low-volume manufacturer, its actions would have a limited impact on the environment.\nLamborghini is a luxury brand ultimately owned by the Volkswagen Group. It currently has three main models.\nThe Temerario and Revuelto are supercars. Both are plug-in hybrids, combining powerful petrol engines with electric motors. They can run in all-electric mode, but only for very short distances.\nThe Urus is a luxury SUV, currently available as a plug-in hybrid and as a conventional petrol-powered car. Less exotic and certainly less ostentatious than the supercars, it nevertheless makes up more than half of the company's sales.\nThere is also a limited edition 'super-sports' car: the Fenomeno, which has a top speed of more than 215mph. Only 30 will be built, each costing at least €3m (£2.6m) before taxes.\nTwo years ago, Lamborghini announced plans for an all-electric successor to the Urus, which would have been available from 2029. However, the plan was recently shelved, with the electric model now not expected before 2035.\nIt had also planned to make a brand new battery-powered grand tourer (GT), to be called the Lanzador. However, the future of that project is also deeply uncertain.\n\"We still need to decide whether we are going full electric, the decision we took some years ago, or seeing whether in the new environment this should also be a plug-in hybrid\", said Mr Winkelmann.\nThe new environment he referred to is a perceived waning of interest in electric cars among high-end buyers.\n\"Today enthusiasm for electric cars is going down\", he explained. \"We see a huge opportunity to stay with internal combustion engines and a battery system much longer than expected\".\nContinuing to use internal combustion engines for another 10 years, he said, would be \"paramount for the success of the company\". Customers, he insisted, still hankered after the noise and fury of a conventional motor.\n\"This is something they want, they still want the sound and the emotion of an internal combustion engine\", he said.\nIt's an approach that contrasts with that of Lamborghini's Italian arch-rival Ferrari, which is pushing ahead with its own plans for a first all-electric car.\nThe aptly-named Elettrica is due to be unveiled next year, though the company showed off some key components at its Capital Markets Day earlier this month.\nIt will be sold alongside conventional and hybrid models.\nFerrari chief executive Benedetto Vigna said it would have driving traits that were \"unique in the heart, in the soul of our clients.\"\nMr Winkelmann insisted his own company was not ignoring the ongoing pressure to cut emissions.\n\"We are selling 10,000 cars in a world that is producing 80 million cars a year, so our impact in terms of CO2 emissions is not that important\", he said.\n\"For sure, we are socially responsible, but it doesn't really make a lot of difference\".\nThe sale of new petrol and diesel cars, including plug-in hybrids, is due to be banned in both the the EU and the UK from 2035.\nHowever, in the EU, there has been intense lobbying from some manufacturers for the transition to electric cars to be given more time, in order to \"acknowledge current industrial and geopolitical realities\".\nIf that happens, internal combustion engines could remain on the market beyond the current deadline.\nMeanwhile the UK's rules provide an exemption for \"low volume\" manufacturers who register fewer than 2,500 new cars each year.\nThis would currently cover Lamborghini, which sold just 795 cars here last year.",

    "body": "Landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions in tatters after US pressure\nA landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks.\nMore than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.\nBut US President Donald Trump had called the plan a \"green scam\" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they voted in favour of it.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a \"huge win\" for Trump.\nBut reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a \"plea\" for this not to be repeated.\nIn a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year.\nThe chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised.\nThe motion passed by just a handful of votes.\nHon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was \"unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change\".\n\"We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,\" he said.\nThe shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards.\nSpeaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : \"We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.\"\n\"Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,\" he added.\nThe UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain.\nThe countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.\nSome key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings.\nIsland states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.\nThe deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.\nThe agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.\nShipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive.\n\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations.\nThis means without intervention the International Maritime Organisation previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%.\nThe meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers.\nPosting on Truth Social on Thursday night President Trump wrote: \"The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers.\"\nWith talks now delayed the carefully planned timeline to get the regulations in place for 2028 does not appear feasible.\n\"A delay in action may require changes to the text of agreement that undermine the planned timeline, and could revert years of work to date,\" said Blánaid Sheeran, an observer to the talks and policy officer at environmental NGO Opportunity Green.",

Japan's Nikkei index closed down 1.4% and in Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index was 2.5% lower.\nBut shares of some of the US banks hit hardest on Thursday clawed back some ground.\nIn early afternoon trade on Friday, shares in Zions Bank were up about 4%, following its 13% fall on Thursday. Shares in Western Alliance Bancorp, which had dropped almost 11%, were also up nearly 2%.\nIn an interview on the Fox Business Network, the director of the White House National Economic Council described the issues as \"messes\" left by the Biden administration, while maintaining that US banks were well positioned to handle the stress.\n\"Right now, the banking sector has ample reserves,\" Kevin Hassett said. \"We're very optimistic that we can stay way, way, way ahead of the curve on this.\"\nInvestors have been nervous following the failure of two high-profile US firms, car loan company Tricolor and car parts maker First Brands.\nThese failures have raised questions about the quality of deals in what is known as the private credit market - where companies arrange loans from non-bank lenders.\nThis week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US's largest bank JPMorgan Chase, warned that these two failures could be a sign of more to come.\n\"My antenna goes up when things like that happen,\" he told analysts. \"I probably shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"\nThere have also been warnings that the surge in artificial intelligence investment has produced a bubble in the US stock market - including from Mr Dimon - leading to fears that shares are overvalued.\nThe market turbulence on Friday saw the price of gold reach a fresh record high of $4,380 per ounce, as investors looked for safe havens for their money.\nAnother closely watched measure of market nerves, the VIX volatility index sometimes called the \"Fear Index\", hit its highest level since April.",

    "body": "Netherlands' renewables drive putting pressure on its power grid\nIn a Dutch government TV campaign called \"Flip the Switch\" an actress warns viewers about their electricity usage.\n\"When we all use electricity at the same time, our power grid gets overloaded,\" she says. \"This can cause malfunctions. So, use as little electricity as possible between four and nine.\"\nIt is the sign that, in one of the most-advanced economies in the world, something has gone wrong with the country's power supply.\nThe Netherlands has been an enthusiastic adopter of electric cars. It has the highest number of charging points per capita in Europe.\nAs for electricity production, the Netherlands has replaced gas from its large North Sea reserves with wind and solar.\nSo much so that it leads the way in Europe for the number of solar panels per person. In fact, more than one third of Dutch homes have solar panels fitted.\nThe country is also aiming for offshore wind farms to be its biggest source of energy by 2030.\nThis is all good in environmental terms, but it's putting the Dutch national electricity grid under enormous stress, and in recent years there have been a number of power cuts.\nThe problem is \"grid congestion\", says Kees-Jan Rameau, chief executive of Dutch energy producer and supplier Eneco, 70% of whose electricity generation is now solar and wind.\n\"Grid congestion is like a traffic jam on the power grid. It's caused by either too much power demand in a certain area, or too much power supply put onto the grid, more than the grid can handle.\"\nHe explains that the problem is that the grid \"was designed in the days when we had just a few very large, mainly gas-fired power plants\".\n\"So we built a grid with very big power lines close to those power plants, and increasingly smaller power lines as you got more towards the households.\n\"Nowadays we're switching to renewables, and that means there's a lot of power being injected into the grid in the outskirts of the network where there are only relatively small power lines.\"\nAnd these small power lines are struggling to cope with all the electricity coming in from wind turbines and solar panels scattered around the country.\nDamien Ernst, professor of electrical engineering at Belgium's Liege University, is one of Europe's leading experts on electricity grids. He says it is an expensive problem for the Netherlands to solve.\n\"They have a grid crisis because they haven't invested enough in their distribution networks, in their transmission networks, so they are facing bottlenecks everywhere, and it will take years and billions of dollars to solve this.\"\nProf Ernst adds that it is a Europe-wide issue. \"We have an enormous amount of solar panels being installed, and they are installed at a rate that is much, much too high for the grid to be able to accommodate.\"\nAt Eneco's headquarters in Rotterdam, Mr Kees-Jan Rameau highlights a large control panel that the company calls its \"virtual power plant\" and \"the brain of our operations\". It is used to help balance the grid, avoiding blackouts.\nWhen electricity generation is too high across the Netherlands, it enables Eneco to turn wind turbines out of the wind and turn off solar panels.\nAs for when demand for electricity is too high, it lowers the power to customers who have accepted to allow Eneco to stop or reduce their electricity supply when the network is under strain in exchange for lower prices.\nBut for homes and companies who want to scale-up their use of electricity with a new or larger grid connection, that, increasingly, is just not possible.\n\"Often consumers want to install a heat pump, or charge their electric vehicle at home, but that requires a much bigger power connection, and increasingly they just cannot get it,\" says Mr Kees-Jan Rameau.\nHe adds that it is worse for businesses. \"Often they want to expand their operations, and they just cannot get extra capacity from the grid operators.\nAnd it has got to the point where even new housing construction in the Netherlands is becoming increasingly difficult, because there's just no capacity to connect those new neighbourhoods to the grid.\"\nThose people, and companies, end up on waiting lists for a number of years. At the same time there are also waiting lists for those who want to supply the grid with power, such as a new home fitted with solar panels on its roof.\nTennet, the government-owned agency that runs the Netherlands' national grid, says that 8,000 companies are currently waiting to be able to feed in electricity, while 12,000 others are waiting for permission to use more power.\nSome sectors of the Dutch economy are warning that it is hampering their growth. \"Grid congestion is putting the future of the Dutch chemical industry at risk… while in other countries it will be easier to invest,\" says the president of the Dutch Chemical Association Nienke Homan.\nSo, was all this avoidable? \"In hindsight I think almost every problem is avoidable,\" says Mr Kees-Jan Rameau.\nHe adds that following the 2015 Paris Agreement on trying to tackle climate change, \"we were very much focussing on increasing the renewable power generation side. But we kind of underestimated the impact it would have on the power grid.\"\nTennet is now planning to spend €200bn ($235bn; £174bn) on reinforcing the grid, including laying some 100,000km (62,000 miles) of new cables between now and 2050.\nThat's a huge amount of money, but there is also a big cost to not spending it. Grid congestion is costing the Dutch economy up to €35bn a year, according to a 2024 report from management consultancy group Boston Consulting Group.\nEugene Baijings, who is in charge of grid congestion with Tennet, says that patience is sadly required. \"To strengthen and reinforce the grid, we need to double, triple, sometimes increase tenfold the capacity of the existing grid.\n\"And it's taking on average about 10 years to do a project like that before it goes live, of which the first eight are legislation and getting the rights to put cables in the ground with all property owners. And only the last two years are the construction period.\n\"And meanwhile the energy transition is going that fast that we cannot cope with it, with the existing grid. So every additional request [to connect] is adding to the waiting list.\"\nAt the Dutch energy ministry, which is actually called the Ministry for Climate Policy and Green Growth, the Minister Sophie Hermans wasn't available for an interview. But her office gave a statement:\n\"In hindsight, the speed at which our electricity consumption has grown might have been collectively underestimated in the past by all parties involved. It is also hard to predict where the growth will occur first, as this results from individual companies/sectors and households.\"\nAs for solutions, the ministry says it has a \"National Grid Congestion Action Plan\" focussed on adjusting legislation so grid expansion permits can be granted more quickly.\nIt is encouraging people to make better use of the existing grid with, for example, its Flip the Switch campaign.\nAnd the financial incentive for people who feed their surplus solar electricity into the grid is being reduced to almost nothing. In some cases, people will even have to pay to feed solar power into the grid.",

    "body": "Paraguay – the Silicon Valley of South America?\nGabriela Cibils is on a mission – to help turn Paraguay into the Silicon Valley of South America.\nWhen she was growing up in the landlocked country, nestled between Brazil and Argentina, she says the nation \"wasn't super tech focused\".\nBut it was different for Ms Cibils, as her parents worked in the technology sector. And she was inspired to study in the US, where she got a degree in computing and neuroscience from the University of California, Berkeley.\nAfter graduating she spent eight years working in Silicon Valley, near San Francisco, with roles at various American start-ups.\nBut rather than staying permanently in the US, a few years ago she decided to return home to Paraguay. She's now helping to lead efforts to build a large and successful tech sector that puts the country of seven million people on the world map - and attract some of the globe's tech giants.\n\"I saw first hand the impact that technology can have on your life,\" says Ms Cibils. \"After being exposed to such a different world [in Silicon Valley], it's my responsibility to bring that mindset back and combine it with the talent I see in Paraguay.\"\nShe is now a partner at global technology and investment firm Cibersons, whose headquarters is in Paraguay's capital Asunción.\nWhile most countries would love to build a world-class tech sector, Paraguay has a distinct advantage in one regard – an abundance of cheap, green electricity.\nThis is thanks to 100% of its generation now coming from hydroelectric power.\nThis is centred on the giant Itaipu Dam on the Paraná River, which forms part of the border between Paraguay and Brazil. This huge hydroelectric power station, the largest in the world outside of China, supplies 90% of Paraguay's electricity needs, and 10% of Brazil's.\nIn fact, such is Paraguay's surplus of electricity that its electricity prices are the lowest in South America.\nAnd it is the world's largest exporter of clean energy.\nThe Paraguayan government hopes that the country's abundance of cheap, green electricity will attract global tech firms increasingly focused on the massive energy demands of AI computing.\n\"If you want to install any technology investment like AI data centres, keep in mind hydroelectric power is both renewable and steady,\" says Paraguayan software development entrepreneur Sebastian Ortiz-Chamorro.\n\"Compared to other renewable energy sources like wind or solar, that have their ups and downs, it's much more attractive for creating data centres or any other electro intensive activity that requires a steady electricity source.\"\nHe adds that in addition to Itaipu, and Paraguay's other large state-owned hydroelectric plant, the Yacyretá Dam, private companies can easily build their own smaller facilities.\nOn a visit to California last year Paraguay's President Santiago Peña spoke with companies like Google and OpenAI to encourage them to invest in Paraguay. It remains to be seen if such industry giants open large operations in the country.\nMinister of Technology and Communication Gustavo Villate is working closely with the president on the continuing efforts.\n\"We have the youngest population. We have a lot of renewable green energy. We have low taxes and economic stability,\" he says proudly.\nI'm taken on a tour with the minister of a planned new digital park near Asunción's main airport. It's currently green fields and some army barracks.\nMr Villate unfurls plans to show off the lakes, a childcare centre and other buildings which he says should be ready in under two years.\n\"The government are going to invest around $20m (£15m) for the first stage, but the idea is for private companies to invest the rest,\" he says.\nEven though the park isn't ready yet, Mr Villate says the collaboration already happening between the public, private and university sectors is key to building an ecosystem to attract foreign investors.\nThe government thinks the country's young population will be a key attraction, and able to provide a large tech workforce. The average age in Paraguay is 27.\nBut more young people will need to be trained. The technology minister says the new digital park will also be home to The University of Technology, which is a joint venture between Taiwan and Paraguay.\nMeanwhile, there are other initiatives to train young people in the country. \"We are working really hard to create a mass of software engineers, programmers and everything you need to provide software services,\" says Vanessa Cañete, president of trade group Paraguayan Chamber of the Software Industry.\nMs Cañete says she is also passionate about encouraging more women to study computer engineering. In 2017 she set up Girls Code, a non-profit association which aims to close the tech gender gap.\nIt organises programming and robotics workshops for teenagers and young women, with more than 1,000 receiving some sort of training to date.\nMs Cañete adds that software developers are also given English lessons for up to four years to improve their communication with overseas firms.\nThe people I met are brimming with positivity about what Paraguay has to offer the tech world, but they are also pragmatic.\nMs Cibils says there are still \"growing pains\" for foreign investors, with issues like bureaucracy, which can hold things up adapting local contracts to standardised international ones.\nBut she is adamant that \"if you put innovation at its core and leverage all the benefits that the country has I think Paraguay can be a superpower\".",

    "body": "How good is the battery in a used electric vehicle?\nWhen Kerry Dunstan and his partner set out to buy a new electric car this summer, one of the questions they asked was, \"How's the battery?\".\nThey'd found a 2021 Nissan Leaf with just 29,000 miles on it, and the dealer told them the condition of the battery, or its state of health (SOH), was still around 93%.\nThe couple were sold. For £12,500, they got an EV with a big boot and plenty of room for passengers.\nThough Mr Dunstan, a cabinetmaker who also owns a somewhat snazzier electric Volvo SUV, hasn't quite fallen in love with the aging Leaf.\n\"I like sporty, jazzy cars – and it's just a bit 'meh',\" he says.\nHowever, he adds the Leaf has performed exactly as expected during the three months they've owned it.\nIt used to be that age and mileage were the two headline details pored over by would-be buyers of second-hand cars. But as more people shift to electric, scrutinising the health of a car's battery has become arguably even more important.\nHow has that battery been treated? Did the last owner regularly fast charge it to 100%, for example? That has the potential to shorten an EV battery's lifespan.\nThis battery black box problem has put some consumers off buying a second-hand EV. But battery analytics firms say they can reveal the condition of an old EV's battery with high accuracy. And industry experts say some EVs are lasting longer than many predicted.\nTake Mr Dunstan's Nissan Leaf. This is a model of EV built without the kind of sophisticated, liquid-based battery cooling system common to many other EVs. While Nissan has rectified this in the latest generation of Leafs, earlier models show a considerable shortening of their range year by year, according to data analysed by US insurance and research firm NimbleFins.\nMr Dunstan is unfazed. \"I charge both my EVs to 100% and I put them on charge when I need to charge them – I don't worry about it,\" he says.\nFor people in the market for a second-hand EV who are plagued by battery anxieties, however, Austria-based firm Aviloo says it has a solution. \"We really can, completely independently, determine the state of health of a battery,\" says chief product officer, Patrick Schabus.\nAviloo is one of several battery analytics businesses in the market. The company, which provides battery health certificates for major UK outlet British Car Auctions, offers two products.\nThere's a premium test, where EV owners plug a data logging box roughly the size of a glasses case into their car so that it can monitor battery performance while they use the car over a few days, going from 100% charge down to 10%.\nOr, they can opt for a quicker flash test, which uses a different box to suck up data from the car's battery management software and then analyse it with the help of a computer model. \"We can do this at a standstill in under two minutes,\" says Mr Schabus.\nThe premium test observes battery discharge closely, picking up fluctuations in current or voltage, and can reveal extra detailed information about the health of individual cells in the battery, says Aviloo.\nMarcus Berger, Aviloo's chief executive, says his company's analytics results sometimes diverge \"substantially\" from the battery SOH percentages produced by some cars' own built-in analytics systems.\nHe challenges conventional wisdom that batteries with an SOH below 80% are too far gone: \"An EV with a state of health below 80% can still be a great car… It just needs to be priced [appropriately].\"\nIn New Zealand, EV owner Lucy Hawcroft, who works in a sustainability role for an infrastructure firm, bought a Nissan Leaf with her husband roughly three years ago. She recalls getting an SOH result of 95% or so from the dealership. But a year later an independent mechanic checked the SOH again for them.\n\"It dropped quite a bit,\" she recalls. \"My husband was a bit surprised, or concerned, about that.\"\nHowever, the car still has a range of around 160km (100 miles) when fully charged. The pair mostly use it for short journeys of up to 10km. Mrs Hawcroft says she has friends whose EVs have much bigger ranges, of around 400km: \"That would be ideal.\"\nFor David Smith, sales director at Cleevely Electric Vehicles in Cheltenham, being able to analyse used EVs' batteries in detail is a deal-maker. Most customers ask for this information, he says. His company uses SOH reports from ClearWatt, another battery analytics firm.\n\"They're completely independent. We can't interfere with the reports,\" he says. \"Once customers have seen the report, that aids the sale nine times out of 10.\"\nMatt Cleevely, managing director at Cleevely Electric Vehicles, adds that it's often possible to replace groups of cells or modules within a battery pack – far cheaper than installing a whole new battery.\nAs for how you should charge your own EV in order to best take care of its battery, Simona Onori at Stanford University says, \"There is likely a sweet spot between frequent fast charging and avoiding it altogether.\" However, she adds that, to her knowledge, this is not something that has yet been thoroughly studied.\nDespite some consumers' wariness, battery technology has noticeably improved in recent years, says Max Reid, head of battery costs at market research firm CRU. \"The older batteries might last maybe 500 to 1,000 [charging] cycles,\" he explains. \"Now, it's 10,000 cycles in some of these new EV cells coming out.\"\nBatteries that are no longer good enough for the EV they were designed for can still be useful, says Paul Chaundy at Second Life EV Batteries, in Dorset. For instance, some of his customers are businesses that use former EV batteries to store electricity at their premises. They might have, say, six electric forklifts but a grid connection only large enough for charging ports to supply two or three of the forklifts.\nRegarding the varying methodologies car manufacturers use to generate SOH reports for their own vehicles, Mr Chaundy says, \"We need more standards around that, I think.\"",

    "body": "China has found Trump's pain point - rare earths\nLast week, China's Ministry of Commerce published a document that went by the name of \"announcement No. 62 of 2025\".\nBut this wasn't just any bureaucratic missive. It has rocked the fragile tariffs truce with the US.\nThe announcement detailed sweeping new curbs on its rare earth exports, in a move that tightens Beijing's grip on the global supply of the critical minerals - and reminded Donald Trump just how much leverage China holds in the trade war.\nChina has a near-monopoly in the processing of rare earths - crucial for the production of everything from smartphones to fighter jets.\nUnder the new rules, foreign companies now need the Chinese government's approval to export products that contain even a tiny amount of rare earths and must declare their intended use.\nIn response, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and put export controls on key software.\n\"This is China versus the world. They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it,\" said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nOn Thursday, China said the US had \"deliberately provoked unnecessary misunderstanding and panic\" over the rare earths restrictions.\n\"Provided the export licence applications are compliant and intended for civilian use, they will be approved,\" a commerce ministry spokesperson added.\nThis week, the world's two biggest economies also imposed new port fees on each other's ships.\nThe flare-up in the trade war brings to an end months of relative calm after top US and Chinese officials brokered a truce in May.\nLater this month, Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are expected to meet and experts have told the BBC the rare earths restrictions will give China the upper hand.\nChina's new controls are bound to \"shock the system\" as they target vulnerabilities in American supply chains, said international business lecturer Naoise McDonagh from Australia's Edith Cowan University.\n\"The timing has really upset the kind of timeline for negotiations that the Americans wanted,\" he added.\nRare earth minerals are essential for the production of a whole range of technology such as solar panels, electric cars and military equipment.\nFor example, a single F-35 fighter jet is estimated to need more than 400kg (881.8lb) of rare earths for its stealth coatings, motors, radars and other components.\nChina's rare earth exports also account for around 70% of the world's supply of metals used for magnets in electric vehicle motors, said Natasha Jha Bhaskar from advisory firm the Newland Global Group.\nBeijing has worked hard to gain its dominance of the global rare earth processing capacity, said critical minerals researcher Marina Zhang from the University of Technology Sydney.\nThe country has nurtured a vast talent pool in the field, while its research and development network is years ahead of its competitors, she added.\nWhile the US and other countries are investing heavily to develop alternatives to China for supplies of rare earths, they are still some way from achieving that goal.\nWith its own large deposits of rare earths, Australia has been tipped as a potential challenger to China. But its production infrastructure is still underdeveloped, making processing relatively expensive, Ms Zhang said.\n\"Even if the US and all its allies make processing rare earths a national project, I would say that it will take at least five years to catch up with China.\"\nThe new restrictions expand measures Beijing announced in April that caused a global supply crunch, before a series of deals with Europe and the US eased the shortages.\nThe latest official figures from China show that exports of the critical minerals were down in September by more than 30% compared to a year ago.\nBut analysts say China's economy is unlikely to be hurt by the drop in exports.\nRare earths make up a very small part of China's $18.7tn a year economy, said Prof Sophia Kalantzakos from New York University.\nSome estimates put the value of the exports at less than 0.1% of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP).\nWhile rare earths' economic value to China may be tiny their strategic value \"is huge\", she said, as they give Beijing more leverage in talks with the US.\nDespite accusing China of \"betrayal\", Bessent has left the door open to negotiations.\n\"I believe China is open to discussion and I am optimistic this can be de-escalated,\" he said.\nDuring a meeting with the US private equity group Blackstone's chief executive Stephen Schwarzman on Thursday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also highlighted the need for talks.\n\"The two sides should engage in effective communication, properly resolve differences and promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations,\" Wang said, according to the ministry's website.\nWhat China has done recently is \"getting its ducks in a row\" ahead of those trade talks with the US, said Prof Kalantzakos.\nIn curbing rare earth exports, Beijing has found its \"best immediate lever\" to pressure Washington for a favourable deal, Ms Bhaskar said.\nJiao Yang from Singapore Management University believes that although Beijing holds the cards in the short-run, Washington does have some strategic options at its disposal.\nThe US could offer to lower tariffs, which is likely to be attractive to Beijing as the trade war has hit its manufacturers hard, said Prof Jiao said.\nChina's economy is reliant on the income from the goods it makes and exports. The latest official figures show its exports to the US were down by 27% compared to a year ago.\nWashington can also threaten to hit China with more trade restrictions to hamper efforts to develop its technology sector, said Prof McDonagh.\nFor example, the White House has already targeted China's need for high-end semiconductors by blocking its purchases of Nvidia's most advanced chips.\nBut experts say that is likely to have only limited effects.\nMeasures targeting Beijing's tech industry may slow China but won't \"stop it dead in the water,\" said Prof McDonagh.\nChina has shown with its recent economic strategy that it is willing to take some pain to achieve its long-term goals, he added.\n\"China can carry on even if it costs a lot more under US export controls.\n\"But if China cuts off these rare earth supplies, that can actually stop everyone's industry. That's the big difference.\"",

    "body": "Why the US needs China's rare earths\nThe trade war between China and the US has reignited after a truce lasting months - this time over rare earths.\nChina has a chokehold on the minerals which are used in the making of electric cars, electronics and military weapons. It has tightened its grip over rare earth exports in recent months, and now requires companies in China to get government approval before shipping the minerals abroad.\nThese curbs have dealt a major blow to the US, whose industries are heavily dependent on imports of the precious metal.\nAnalysts say China is using its dominance as a key bargaining chip in trade talks with Washington.\nBut why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?\nWhat are rare earths and what are they used for?\nRare earths are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.\nMost are abundant in nature, but they are known as rare because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.\nAlthough you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like neodymium, yttrium and europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.\nFor instance, neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.\nYttrium and europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.\nRare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.\nWhat does China control?\nChina has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them, which is the process of separating them from other minerals.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.\nThat means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.\nBoth the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.\nAll rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.\n\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.\nBut China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight. Rather, it is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.\nIn a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".\n\"Beginning in the late 20th Century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.\n\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"\nHow has China restricted exports of these minerals?\nIn response to tariffs imposed by Washington in April, China began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.\nThese are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.\nSince then, all companies needed to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.\nThat is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of dual use products.\nAccording to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.\nIn October, China expanded its controls over the export of rare earths.\nForeign companies are now required to have the Chinese government's approval to export even small amounts of rare earths and must explain their intended use.\nHow could this impact the US?\nA US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.\nIt is the reason why Beijing's export curbs have the ability to hit the US hard.\nWashington has accused China of betrayal over its rare earth export restrictions.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described China's curbs as \"economic coercion\" and a \"global supply chain power grab\". But he has also left the door open to negotiations.\nHeavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.\nA CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.\nIt adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".\n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.\nAnd it's not only in the field of defence.\nUS manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.\n\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.\n\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.\nIf such a shortage from China persists in the long run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".\nAnd it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. In April, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such critical minerals.\n\"President Trump recognises that an over-reliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.\n\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"\nCan't the US produce its own rare earths?\nThe US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.\nThere used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.\nBut these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.\nThis is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.\nAnother place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.\nTrump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish-dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.\nThese might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.\n\"The challenge the US faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.\n\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\"",

Fashion brands like Louis Vuitton and Burberry reported a drop in sales in recent months in China, which accounts for around a third of global luxury sales.\nHowever, investors seem optimistic about a rebound in China's market, as shares of luxury brands like LVMH and Moncler rose this week, lifted by signs of improved demand in the region.",

    "body": "Cheap oil, high stakes: Can India do without Russia?\nFirst came the tariffs in August - 50% duties on Indian goods, dressed up as punishment for buying Russian oil.\nThen came US President Donald Trump's claim on Wednesday that Indian PM Narendra Modi had privately agreed to end those purchases \"within a short period of time\".\nNext day, Russia responded cautiously, while India distanced itself from his comments.\nRussia's envoy in Delhi, Denis Alipov, said its oil was \"very beneficial for the Indian economy and for the welfare of Indian people\". The Indian government said its import policy was \"guided by the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario\", and later a spokesperson added he was unaware of \"any conversation yesterday\" between Modi and Trump.\nCaught between an old ally in Moscow and mounting pressure from Washington, India's energy policy has become a delicate balancing act. But just how critical is Russian oil to the Indian economy?\nLast year, India, the world's third-largest oil importer, bought $52.7bn of Russian crude - 37% of its oil bill - followed by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Nigeria, and the US.\nBut how did India's energy mix come to look like this?\nBefore the Russian imports surged, India's top 10 crude suppliers in 2021-22 were Russia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the US, Brazil, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria, and Oman. The remaining 31 countries formed a long tail of smaller, opportunistic deals that ebb and flow with global prices.\nDespite some popular perception that India relies solely on Russian oil, it also imports significant volumes from the US. In 2024, India bought $7.7bn of American petroleum products - including $4.8bn of crude - but still ran a $3.2bn petroleum trade deficit with Washington, according to Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\nBetween 2018-19 and 2021-22, India's oil basket underwent its first major shift.\nImports from Iran and Venezuela - once 17% of the total or 41 million tonnes - were phased out, their place largely filled by traditional suppliers such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, according to a study by Partha Mukhopadhyay of the Centre for Policy Research, a Delhi-based think tank. Both countries faced heavy sanctions, making it difficult for India to continue importing oil from them.\nThe second transition came with the Ukraine war.\nIndia's imports of Russian oil soared from 4 million tonnes in 2021-22 to over 87 million tonnes in 2024-25. The surge was driven by discounts offered by Russia after Western sanctions, making its crude more attractive to Indian refiners.\nAfter 2021-22, Russian oil averaged a 14.1% discount in 2022-23 and 10.4% in 2023-24, saving India roughly $5bn a year- or 3–4% of its crude import bill.\nWhile the Gulf trio - Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - saw their share fall by 11 percentage points, their actual volumes held steady as India's overall imports rose from 196 million to 244 million tonnes.\nThe adjustment fell largely on others: imports from the US, Brazil, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria and Oman more than halved, and the \"rest\" of 31 smaller suppliers also declined. A few, like Angola and South Korea, bucked the trend, and even Venezuela made a modest return.\n\"Thus, the increase in imports from Russia has been accompanied by a decrease in imports from many countries, some of whom saw a drastic fall in their exports to India,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. In other words, Russia's rise came at the expense of nearly everyone else.\nFor India, the savings from discounted Russian oil remain modest - under 1% of India's $900bn goods and services import bill - but still add up to a substantial $9bn.\n\"If India were to halt Russian purchases, global oil prices could rise, wiping out those savings and adding even more to import costs - not just for India, but worldwide. In effect, buying discounted Russian crude has helped Delhi cushion its economy while quietly stabilising global prices,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay.\nThat said, oil prices have fallen 27% this year, from $78 to $59 per barrel - far more volatility than a halt in Indian imports from Russia could cause. Weak demand in the overall market also makes it easier for other countries to compensate for the 4–5% of global production these imports represent, he notes.\nAjay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and head of the GTRI, says for India, Russian oil \"offers price stability and refinery compatibility\".\n\"Most Indian refineries are calibrated for heavier crude grades similar to Russia's Urals blend. Replacing those with light US shale would require costly reconfiguration and could cut yields of diesel and jet fuel, says Mr Srivastava. The Urals blend is a medium-to-heavy Russian crude oil, meaning Indian refineries are well-suited to process it efficiently without major adjustments.\nFor Delhi, the trade-off is stark: continue with discounted Russian oil and risk US retaliation, or shift to costlier Middle Eastern and American grades and face higher domestic fuel prices, says Mr Srivastava.\nAs Washington tightens the screws, India finds itself on the horns of a dilemma - the delayed India-US trade deal hangs in the balance, and the choice between short-term gains and long-term costs could define the next phase of bilateral ties.",

Critics have said it undercuts the American workforce. It is used heavily by the US tech sector, both by major companies and small startups.\nThe White House responded to the suit by calling the fee lawful and a \"necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms\" to the programme.\nMr Trump's order only applies to new visa requests in the programme and vows to restrict entry unless a payment was made.\nThe move drew the ire of tech executives, including billionaire Elon Musk, who have argued that the H-1B programme enables the US to attract top talent from around the world.\nMr Musk, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google-parent Alphabet, are among the executives who began their careers in the US on H-1B visas.\nMr Trump also set up a new \"gold card\" to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.\nThe Chamber of Commerce argued in its complaint Tuesday that if implemented, \"the fee would inflict significant harm on American businesses,\" forcing them to either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled employees.\"\nBut in a press release, the Chamber which represents more than 3 million businesses, also praised Mr Trump for an agenda of \"securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth.\"\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick argued in support of Trump's order and said \"all of the big companies\" were on board with the fee.\n\"The company needs to decide... is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home, and they should go hire an American,\" Lutnick has said.\nMany H1-B visas holders come to the United States from India and China.\nTech companies argue that workers brought into the US cannot readily be replaced by American workers.\nBut White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said the administration's action on H-1B visas discourages companies from \"driving down American wages.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

It said 42,000 workers were repaid more than £6m.\nBusiness Secretary Peter Kyle said the government was cracking down on \"those not playing by the rules\".\nAll three firms blamed past payroll problems for the underpayments and said all affected staff had been remunerated.\nAll the employers named on DBT's list were fined up to double the total amount they owed to staff, some for underpayments dating as far back as 2013.\nPaul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said there was \"no excuse for workers being cheated out of money they're owed. It's bad for workers, families and the economy.\"\nAccording to the government's latest investigations between 2018 and 2023, Euro Garages, known as EG Group, is top of the list short-changing 3,317 of its workers by around £824,000.\nThe company, which was co-founded by billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa but who have since stepped back from leading the firm, has significantly reduced its UK operations over the past year.\nIt sold its UK petrol forecourts business and Cooplands bakeries, but still runs some Starbucks franchise stores across the country.\nIn a statement, an EG Group spokesperson said: \"These historic payroll issues that took place between 2015 and 2019 have been fully rectified.\n\"All affected employees were subsequently reimbursed in full in agreement with HMRC.\"\nThe firm said it had improved its systems to make sure it complied with UK laws and maintained that it was committed to treating employees fairly.\nCentrica, which owns British Gas, was eighth on DBT's list having failed to pay £167,815 to 356 workers.\nA spokesperson for the company said it supported fair pay and pointed to technical faults in its payroll system between 2015 and 2019.\n\"This issue relates to a small number of historic technical errors which was put right as soon as it was identified.\n\"The total underpayment related primarily to salary sacrifice arrangements and training bonds, rather than take home pay, and was around £160,000 – our UK annual wage bill is currently around £1.2bn.\"\nHigh Street retailer Holland & Barrett is next on the list after it failed to pay more than £153,000 to 2,551 workers.\nIn a statement, the company said past issues with minimum wage payments, between 2015 and 2021, had since been fixed in 2022.\n\"This was not a case of deliberate underpayment,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"The issue stemmed from legacy practices such as requiring team members to wear specific shoes, unpaid training completed at home, and time spent preparing for shifts at our Burton distribution site.\"\nHolland & Barrett said it remained committed to fair pay and that it was paying store staff about 5% above the National Living Wage and follows all rules.\n\"While we respect the transparency of the scheme, we are disappointed that naming has occurred over three years after the matter was settled,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe minimum wage for over-21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, is currently £12.21 an hour. Younger employees - aged between 16 and 20 - are entitled to receive the National Minimum Wage, which is set at £10 an hour.",

We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government,\" they said.\nReuters reported that the car maker had paused retooling of the factory in February after US President Donald Trump announced tariffs against Canadian goods.\nStellantis owns 14 car brands, including Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Jeep, Fiat, Citroen, Chrysler and Dodge.\nWhile the car maker has manufacturing plants in the US, it also produces vehicles in the UK, Europe, Canada, Mexico and South America.\nIn July, the company said tariffs imposed by the Trump administration had cost it $349.2m (£259.6m).\nTrump introduced car tariffs to boost the American car manufacturing industry, but within a month he eased tariffs on foreign car parts.\nOn Tuesday, Trump's new 10% tariff on softwood lumber came into effect. It means products from Canada - the second largest producer globally and a major US supplier - now face levies of more than 45%.\nMost Canadian producers already faced a combined 35% in US tariffs due to a long-running trade dispute between the two countries over the product.",

    "body": "Major UK rare earths refinery scrapped in favour of US\nPlans for a groundbreaking rare earths refinery in East Yorkshire have been scrapped, after the company behind the project decided to seek investment in the US instead.\nPensana has spent the past seven years developing a rare earths mine in Angola. The project, one of the largest of its kind in the world, will begin delivering raw materials in 2027.\nThe firm had planned to build a refinery at the Saltend Chemicals Plant near Hull to process the materials into metals used to create powerful magnets.\nBut Pensana said moves by China to keep rare earth prices low has made refining in the UK uneconomic without significant government backing, whereas the US is offering the sector more support.\nThe project at Saltend would have given the UK a strategic foothold in the rare earths industry, which is currently dominated by China.\nThe magnets produced by the plant would have been used in high-tech applications such as motors for electric vehicles, wind turbines and robotics.\nHowever, as first reported by Sky News, the plan has now been dropped.\nDespite what the name implies, rare earths are actually relatively common. The term is used to describe a group of chemically similar minerals which are abundant in the Earth's crust – but which are also comparatively difficult and costly to extract.\nHowever, according to Pensana, China has used its market power in recent years to keep prices artificially low in order to stifle potential competition, meaning it needs government support to make a project viable.\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked about growing tension between the US and China over rare earths.\nThe chancellor said she was working with G7 counterparts \"on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant\".\nIn 2022, Boris Johnson announced plans for \"a multi-million pound investment\" in the Saltend project - launched alongside the then Tory government's 'Critical Minerals Strategy'.\nHowever, according to Pensana's founder and chairman, Paul Atherley, this contribution – actually £5m - was \"nowhere near enough\", and the Treasury proved unwilling to contribute more.\nMr Atherley compares this with a deal between the US government and MP Materials, under which MP will benefit from more than half a billion dollars worth of investment and soft loans to fund a similar facility in California, as well as a 10-year agreement to ensure all the magnets it produces are sold for a minimum price.\nEarlier this year Pensana announced plans to team up with the US refiner ReElement, to develop a \"sustainable, independent rare earth supply chain\". It is also planning to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\nMr Atherley insists he remains \"very positive on the UK\". Another company he is involved in, Tees Valley Lithium, is pushing ahead with plans for a lithium refinery in the Northeast.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"It is disappointing Pensana has decided not to proceed with this development, but it is ultimately a commercial decision for the company.\n\"We will publish a new Critical Minerals Strategy soon to help secure our supply chains for the long term, and we're reducing industrial electricity costs for businesses as part of our modern Industrial Strategy.\"",

Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective,\" the spokesman said.\nOil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey.\n\"Now I've got to get China to do the same thing,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, as part of his administration's broader push to cut off Moscow's energy funding.\nIn response, a Chinese government spokesman, said it had \"normal, legitimate economic, trade, and energy co-operation with countries around the world, including Russia\".\nThe Kremlin said Russia could provide good quality oil at a lower price.\nAn official said that, if countries were prevented from buying Russian crude, \"then the principles of free trade are being violated\".\nThe Trump administration also wants Japan to stop importing oil and gas from Russia, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he communicated this \"expectation\" to visiting Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato on Wednesday.\nIndia cannot \"immediately\" halt oil shipments, Trump said, adding that the shift will be \"a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon\".\nThe Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India, levies that Trump has characterised as punishment against Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons.\nThe tariffs – which took effect in August and are among the highest in the world – include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine.\nModi has for months stood his ground, arguing that India is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war despite his country's ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIn Moscow, Putin told an energy forum on Thursday the country was still one of the world's largest oil producers despite facing \"unfair\" measures.\nPutin said: \"Russia maintains its position as one of the leading oil producers, despite the use of unfair competition mechanisms against us.\"\nThe UK and the European Union recently lowered a price cap on Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 a barrel to disrupt \"the flow of oil money into Putin's war chest\nThe measure was first introduced in late 2022, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nHowever, Russia has continued to make billions from the sale of oil.\nIndian officials have called the Trump administration's accusations that Delhi profits from Russia's war in Ukraine a double standard, citing ongoing trade with Russia in the US and Europe.\nIndia relies on Russian crude oil, which Delhi has continued to buy at a discount, to support its economy - the fifth largest in the world.\nThe dispute over Russian oil has strained the relationship between Trump and Modi, although the US president on Wednesday praised the Indian leader as a \"great man\".\nModi said last week that he spoke with Trump and that they \"reviewed good progress achieved in trade negotiations\".",

    "body": "India's exports to US plunge as Trump's 50% tariffs bite\nIndia's goods exports to the US, its largest foreign market, dropped sharply by 20% in September and nearly 40% in the last four months, as Trump's steep tariffs took effect, data shows.\nSeptember was the first full month of Washington's 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which kicked in on 27 August. This includes a 25% penalty for Delhi's refusal to stop buying oil from Russia.\n\"US has become India's most severely affected market since the tariff escalation began,\" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\nNegotiations for a trade deal between the two countries are under way, with the goal of concluding an agreement by next month.\nAccording to GTRI, the most significant impact of the tariffs has been felt by labour-heavy sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, and chemicals, which have suffered the heaviest losses.\nShipments to the US have seen four consecutive months of decline, and are down 37.5% - from $8.8bn (£6.5bn) in May to $5.5bn in September.\nThe drop in exports have also contributed to India's trade deficit (the gap between what a country imports and exports), which widened to a 13-month high of $32.15 billion in September.\nSome of the reduction in exports to the US was cushioned by improved trade with countries like the UAE and China.\nTrade negotiations between India and the US resumed last month after months of stalling over a number of differences. An Indian delegation is currently in the US for talks.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine.\nA spokesperson of the Indian foreign ministry said discussions were \"ongoing\" with the US administration which had \"shown interest in deepening energy co-operation with India\".\nBut major sticking points over trade still remain, including access to agriculture and dairy.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and the interests of millions of small farmers.\nUntil recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn in 2024. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "body": "Thousands in UK sue Johnson & Johnson over talcum powder cancer risks\nA major legal claim has been filed in the UK against pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, accusing the firm of knowingly selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos.\nThe claim involves 3,000 people and focuses on internal memos and scientific reports, which have been seen by the BBC.\nThe lawsuit - brought by KP Law against Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and its subsidiary Kenvue Ltd - alleges that J&J was aware as early as the 1960s that its mineral-based talcum powder contained fibrous forms of talc, as well as tremolite and actinolite. Both minerals - when in their fibrous form - are classified as asbestos and linked to potentially deadly cancers.\nThe court papers allege that, despite knowing the minerals were directly linked to cancers, J&J never issued warnings on the packaging of its baby powder. Instead it launched aggressive marketing campaigns portraying the powder as a symbol of purity and safety, the lawsuit claims.\nJ&J denies the allegation as well as any claims it knowingly sold baby powder contaminated with asbestos.\nA statement from the company said its baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer\".\nThe sale of baby powder containing talc stopped in the UK in 2023.\nThe UK action mirrors extensive litigation in the US, where multiple lawsuits have been filed and claimants have been awarded billions of dollars in damages. The company has successfully appealed in some cases.\nLawyers for the claimants estimate damages sought in the UK could extend to hundreds of millions of pounds and that the claim could become the largest product liability case in British history.\nThe claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known cause of cancer.\nTalc, which was used in J&J talcum powders, is a naturally occurring mineral that is often mined in close proximity to deposits of asbestos. It is asbestos minerals in their fibrous needle-like form that are associated with cancer.\nThe claim alleges J&J had identified asbestos in its baby powder as early as the 1960s. One internal document from 1973 allegedly says: \"Our baby powder contains talc fragments classifiable as fiber. Occasionally sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable…\"\nJ&J referred the BBC to its co-defendant company Kenvue, which said this letter was discussing how regulation might change and thereby define talc fibres as asbestos. The firm said that would have been wrong.\n'Keep the whole thing confidential'\nIn the same year, executives discussed the value of a possible patent for a method that aimed to remove asbestos fibres from talc. At the end of the letter, it added: \"We may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.\"\nKenvue says these discussions were confidential because a new patent could have been extremely valuable if the new method had been effective. Ultimately, it did not prove to be effective.\nInstead of declaring warnings on the bottle, the lawsuit claims J&J moved to conceal the risk for decades and maximise profits.\nThe claim alleges that, despite knowing there were carcinogenic fibres in the baby powder, the firm's marketing team discussed how to maximise sales.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, US marketing focused on the sale of pure and gentle powder for newborn babies. By the 1990s and into the 2000s the marketing focus turned to African American women.\nIn 2008, an internal email - seen by the BBC - allegedly discussing branding, says, \"The reality that talc is unsafe for use on/around babies is disturbing…\" It went on to say: \"I don't think we can continue to call it baby powder and keep it in the baby aisle.\"\nKenvue says this conversation was in reference to asphyxiation, which was a rare but known risk at the time relating to use of all body powder, but was not linked to cancer or asbestos and was warned about on the bottle.\nDocuments cited in the UK lawsuit are also alleged to show that from the early 1970s J&J executives pushed US regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept lower sensitivity standards so that tests did not pick up on small amounts of asbestos fibres.\nThe claim cites internal documents, which it says show J&J advocated for talc testing standards that tolerated up to 1% asbestos contamination, arguing that more sensitive detection methods were unnecessary.\nThis, the lawsuit alleges, enabled the company to maintain claims of product purity, misleading regulators and consumers about the presence of asbestos in its talc products.\nKenvue says this misrepresents the context of the document, which references a hypothetical calculation, as requested by the FDA.\n'My mother used it - I used it'\nMany of the claimants in the UK are suffering with, or have died from ovarian cancer, mesothelioma - a cancer that is usually caused by asbestos exposure - or other cancers. All the claimants are alleged to have used J&J's baby powder over an extended period of time.\nSiobhan Ryan, 63, was one young mother who saw the adverts and says she trusted J&J's baby powder.\n\"My mother used it and I used it. It smelt nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them,\" she told the BBC from her home in Somerset.\n\"It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage 4 ovarian cancer.\"\nAt the time of diagnosis it wasn't clear how long Siobhan would survive for, but after three rounds of chemotherapy, a bout of sepsis that nearly killed her, and major surgery to her abdomen, she is alive and able to tell her story 18 months later.\nSiobhan, like the other claimants in this case, thinks her cancer was caused by use of J&J's baby powder.\nThe first rounds of treatment helped control the spread of her cancer, but a few months ago Siobhan found another lump in her groin. She is now back in chemotherapy and surgeons say her cancer is no longer operable.\n\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" Siobhan says.\nOvarian cancer is caused by a combination of genetic, internal and external factors.\n\"The female reproductive tract is open to the external environment so that women can get pregnant,\" says Prof Christina Fotopoulou, a leading gynaecological oncology surgeon at Imperial College London and a leader in the field of ovarian cancer.\n\"Cancer is usually an accumulation of mistakes in the reproduction cycle of the cells and so any harmful factors - internal or external - that disrupt the balance of the cells may contribute to these mistakes that eventually may lead to cancer.\"\nCommon symptoms of ovarian cancer include persistent bloating, persistent pelvic or abdominal pain, feeling full quickly or an inability to eat, and an increased or urgent need to urinate.\nThose who experience such symptoms frequently - more than 12 times a month - should see a doctor. Extreme fatigue, changes in bowel habits like constipation or diarrhoea, and vaginal bleeding after menopause are also signs you should see your GP.\nOur baby powder 'was compliant'\nEarlier this month, a court in the US state of Connecticut ordered J&J - and its successor entities - to pay $25m to a man diagnosed with terminal peritoneal mesothelioma after lifelong use of J&J baby powder. The jury in the trial found the pharmaceutical company negligent for selling asbestos-contaminated talc products.\nThis trial also included deposition testimony from Dr Steve Mann, former director of toxicology at J&J consumer products, who said he had made safety claims without reviewing any test data. Dr Mann conceded that he had received test results showing asbestos in the baby powder but chose not to inform management or regulators.\nThe judge noted that safer alternatives, such as cornstarch, were available and known to the company, yet J&J continued selling talc-based powder in the US until 2020 and in the UK until three years later.\nFollowing the Connecticut judgement, J&J has denied wrongdoing and is expected to appeal.\nJ&J has moved its consumer health arm to Kenvue, which said in a statement: \"We sympathise deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers - that's why the facts are so important.\"\nIt said the safety of the baby powder was backed by years of testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the UK and around the world\".\nIt said J&J's baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer\".\nUpdate: This story has been updated to make clear Kenvue Ltd is a co-defendant in the case and to attribute some of the responses in this article to that company.",

    "body": "Greece passes labour law allowing 13-hour workdays in some cases\nGreece's parliament has approved a contested labour bill that would allow 13-hour workdays, despite fierce opposition and nationwide strikes.\nThe government said it will modernise Greek labour laws, but a spokesperson for the left-wing opposition Syriza party called the bill a \"legislative monstrosity\".\nUnder the new law, annual overtime is also capped at 150 hours, and the standard 40-hour week remains in place.\nThe government insists that the longer workday is optional, only affects the private sector, and can only be applied up to 37 days a year.\nThursday's vote was backed by MPs from the ruling centre-right New Democracy party, with centre-left Pasok party - now the main opposition - voting against the bill, while the left-wing Syriza party abstained.\nUnions have staged two general strikes demanding the bill's withdrawal this month that brought public transport and services to a standstill.\nLabour Minister Niki Kerameus defended the bill, saying the reforms align Greek legislation with modern labour-market realities, and accused opposition leaders of misleading the public.\nThe laws will give workers the option to take on additional hours with the same employer for 40% higher pay, while ensuring they cannot be dismissed for refusing overtime.\nThis complies with European Union working-time rules, which limit the average week to 48 hours including overtime but allow flexibility over 12 months, the government said.\nAccording to officials, the law gives employees the option to work longer for one employer rather than hold multiple part-time jobs, and that participation will remain voluntary.\nBut opposition parties have accused the government of eroding workers' rights and \"pushing the country back to a labour middle age\". They say Greek employees already work longer hours than most Europeans while earning less and still \"struggle to make ends meet.\"\nThe public-sector union ADEDY said flexible working hours in practice mean \"the abolition of the eight-hour day, the destruction of family and social life and the legalisation of over-exploitation,\" the AFP news agency reports.\nIn 2024, Greece introduced a six-day working week for certain industries in a bid to boost economic growth.\nNew legislation, which came into effect at the start of July, allows employees to work up to 48 hours in a week as opposed to 40.\nAcross the EU in 2024, the longest working weeks in 2024 were recorded in Greece (39.8 hours), followed by Bulgaria (39.0), Poland (38.9) and Romania (38.8).\nThe shortest working week in the bloc is in the Netherlands (32.1), according to Eurostat.\nAs of January 2025, Greece's national minimum wage stood at €968 (£839, $1127) a month, placing it in the lower tier among EU countries.\nUnemployment, which had peaked at 28% during the financial crisis, was 8.1% in August compared with an EU average of 5.9%, figures from Eurostat show.\nGreece is recovering since its decade-long debt crisis, which ended in 2018, but wages and living standards remain among the lowest in the EU.",

The world is changing, and Nestle needs to change faster.\nSuch change would include \"hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount\", he said.\nThe details signalled that Mr Navratil wants to \"bring greater transparency to areas that were previously more opaque in Nestle's cost-saving plans,\" Morningstar equity analyst Diana Radu said .\nThe job cuts, she said, appear to be an effort to \"reset expectations and rebuild investor confidence through measurable actions\".\nMr Navratil's predecessor was sacked by Nestle in early September after an investigation into whistleblower allegations that he did not disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate.\nThe company's outgoing chair Paul Bulcke brought forward his departure date and left his post in the same month.\nIt was reported at the time that investors blamed Mr Bulcke for the company's ongoing problems.\nLast year, an investigation found Nestle baby food products sold in low- and middle-income countries contained unhealthily high levels of sugar.\nThe research, by a Swiss NGO and the International Baby Food Action Network, found that in many cases, the same products sold in wealthy countries had no added sugar.\nVictoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that Mr Navratil \"is clearly looking to make his mark on the business\".\n\"Investors are excited by Navratil's bold steps and are pleased that the C-suite turmoil appears to be in the rear-view mirror,\" she said.\nBut the challenges ahead of him include tariff pressures, rising debt and stiff competition, she said.\nUnite, one of the largest trade unions in the UK, criticised the job cuts and said it would \"respond robustly\" to any British layoffs.\nNestle has sites in York, Halifax, Dalston and Tutbury, as well as staff at Buxton Water, which it owns.\n\"Nestle is a profitable company, selling billions of produce every month.

    "body": "UK economy grew slightly in August ahead of key Budget\nThe UK economy grew slightly in August, official figures show, as focus intensifies on what measures the government might unveil in next month's Budget.\nAn increase in manufacturing output helped the economy expand by 0.1%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, but the figure for July was revised down from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1%.\nThe government has made boosting the economy a priority, but economists predict growth will remain sluggish partly due to people waiting to see what measures Chancellor Rachel Reeves announces in the Budget.\nMany analysts expect that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed to meet the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies is projecting Reeves will need to find £22bn to bolster the government's finances and meet her rules, and will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes.\nBut the influential think tank said the chancellor should be \"bold\" in next month's Budget, and build up a large financial buffer to avoid future spending cuts and tax rises.\nOn Wednesday, Reeves said she was \"looking at further measures on tax and spending, to make sure that the public finances always add up\".\nHer comments were seen as the clearest sign yet that tax rises will be in the Budget, with speculation growing over what measures she might take.\nThe main driver of economic growth in August was the manufacturing sector, which grew by 0.7%.\nHowever, the key services sector - which covers businesses in sectors such as retail, hospitality and finance - saw no growth during the month.\nMonthly growth figures can be volatile, as seen by the downgrade for July, and the ONS is focusing on growth over a rolling three-month period.\nIn the three months to August the economy expanded by 0.3%, which was a small improvement on the 0.2% growth in the three months to July.\n\"Economic growth increased slightly in the latest three months. Services growth held steady, while there was a smaller drag from production than previously,\" said Liz McKeown, ONS director of statistics.\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that while the economy had returned to growth in August, the \"outlook remains weak\".\nShe said households were facing higher costs for essentials such as food, while uncertainty about potential Budget tax rises was \"expected to weigh on activity for both households and businesses\".\n\"As a result, we anticipate growth to remain sluggish over the coming months.\"\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, called August's growth \"meagre\".\nShe said the increases in taxes for businesses that took effect in April - such as the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions - were \"undoubtedly playing a part in restraining growth\".\n\"There is little reason to think GDP growth will accelerate much from here,\" she said.\n\"The disruption to the auto sector caused by the Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack probably meant the economy went backwards in September.\"\nDespite weak growth in the economy, analysts are not expecting the Bank of England to cut interest rates when it meets next month, as inflation in the UK remains high at 3.8%.\nEarlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year.\nHowever, it also said the UK would face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, as result of rising energy and utility bills.\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"We have seen the fastest growth in the G7 since the start of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck.\n\"The chancellor is determined to turn this around by helping businesses in every town and High Street grow, investing in infrastructure and cutting red tape to get Britain building.\"\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest figures show that \"growth continues to be weak and Rachel Reeves is now admitting she is going to hike taxes yet again, despite all her promises\".\n\"If Labour had a plan - or a backbone - they would get spending under control, cut the deficit and get taxes down.\"\nDaisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said the government was \"simply not doing enough to kickstart growth\".\n\"The chancellor must quit her slowcoach approach to the economy and finally drop her damaging National Insurance hike.\"",

It was considered the largest divorce settlement in South Korea's history at the time.\nThe court said a 30bn won slush fund by Ms Roh's father, former president Roh Tae-woo, had helped contribute to the growth of SK Group and could be considered as her contribution to the couple's joint assets.\nMr Chey then appealed the settlement.\nOn Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that the slush fund \"appeared to have originated from bribes illegally received\" by the former president and thus could not be considered part of the couple's assets.\n\"I think it is very significant that the Supreme Court clearly declared that it was wrong to recognise that as a contribution to the couple's joint property,\" said Mr Chey's lawyer, Lee Jae-geun.\nHowever, the Supreme Court upheld a 2bn won alimony payment for Ms Roh.\nShares of SK fell 5.4% after the ruling on Thursday, as it was seen to prolong Mr Chey's legal battle with his ex-wife.\nBut in the short term analysts believe a shake-up at SK Group is unlikely, as Mr Chey is not immediately compelled to raise funds for his divorce settlement.\nHe controls key subsidiaries of the group such as SK Telecom, SK Square and SK Innovation.\nSK's businesses span the telecommunications, energy, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor sectors.",

He was released on his own recognisance and a hearing in the case is scheduled for 21 November.\nProsecutors have accused Bolton of using personal messaging apps and email to illegally transmit sensitive information.\n\"These documents revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations,\" prosecutors wrote.\nBolton said when he was charged that his actions were \"lawful conduct\".\nHe added he had \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.\"\nThe indictment issued this week accused Bolton of sharing \"diary-like entries\" with two unnamed individuals, and using his personal email account to transmit messages with sensitive materials.\nThe indictment also states that between 2019 and 2021, Bolton was allegedly the target of a hacking attack from a \"cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran\" gained access to his account, exposing the classified materials.\n\"Like many public officials throughout history, Ambassador Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in response to the charges.\nLowell described the records in question as \"unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021\".\nAn indictment in the US justice system is a formal accusation issued by a grand jury - a group of members of the public set up by a prosecutor to review evidence to determine if a case should proceed.\nBolton has been scrutinised for his handling of classified information since 2020, when he sought to publish a book about his time in the first Trump administration.\nThe Justice Department tried to block the book's release, alleging it could contain classified information.\nA federal judge ruled against the government, but rebuked Bolton in his decision, writing he had \"gambled with the national security of the United States\".\nAn investigation into Bolton continued into the Joe Biden administration, but did not lead to charges.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Bolton's house and office in August, signalling an active investigation.\nTrump has frequently attacked Bolton in social media and criticised him in public statements.\nIn 2020, when Bolton published his book, The Room Where it Happened: A White House Memoir, the president said he \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in the book and called his former adviser a \"lowlife who should be in jail.\"\nUpon retuning to office, Trump revoked Bolton's security detail this year, along with protection for several other political opponents.\nBolton's indictment comes after Trump's Justice Department brought criminal charges against two of his political opponents: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",

    "body": "What we know about White House plans for an 'Arc de Trump'\nUS President Donald Trump wants to build a triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, the latest in his efforts to make over the capital city in his style.\nThe so-called Arc de Trump would commemorate the country's 250th anniversary next year and is reportedly being privately funded by Trump's supporters.\nA real estate developer by trade, Trump teased plans last week with renderings for the structure being laid out during an Oval Office meeting.\nHis other second-term developments include a gilded makeover for the White House, paving over the Rose Garden and constructing a $250m ballroom, as well as the clearing of homeless encampments throughout the capital.\nWhat does Trump want to build?\nIt's not unusual for a sitting president or first lady to update the White House, but Trump appears to have his sights set on a farther reaching and widely seen development with the new monument.\nThe president wants the arch to be based on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, and to welcome people into the nation's capital from Arlington National Cemetery as they cross the Memorial Bridge.\n\"Every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say something is supposed be here. We have versions of it… This is a mock-up,\" Trump told donors on Wednesday night, referring to a grassy, circular area at the end of the bridge.\nAt a dinner to unveil his plans for the ballroom, Trump said there were three versions of the arch - small, medium and large - but that he liked the largest one the best.\nTrump said the ballroom project was \"fully financed\" and some of the leftover money would be used to fund the arch.\nIt's not yet clear when construction will begin or how much it will cost.\nLast week, Trump displayed renderings for the structure on the Resolute Desk showing a map of the Memorial Bridge that also included a replica of the Lincoln Memorial. A model of his proposed archway stood on the Virginia state side of the Potomac River.\nOn Saturday, Trump posted an illustration of a plan designed by Harrison Design architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau on Truth Social.\nCharbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design, posted a watercolour rendering of the the proposal on social media on 4 September, writing: \"America needs a triumphal arch!\"\nWhere will he build it and how long will it take?\nPlans for Trump's proposed arch are still taking shape but it is expected to be located across the Potomac River on federal land inside the district's boundaries.\nDeveloping a memorial in the District of Columbia is complex given its unique status as the capital city, according to Dr Christine Henry, director of the Center for Historic Preservation at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia.\nNew commemorations typically need congressional approval as part of a 24-step plan developed by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which approves designs along with the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA).\nFederal law prohibits new construction on the National Mall, which is typically the most desirable real estate for monuments.\nPreston Bryant, a former chairman of the NCPC who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and served until 2018 during Trump's first term, said he frequently heard from organisations that wanted to design a monument or memorial on the National Mall.\n\"The Mall is increasingly crowded and unable to accommodate all who want to have a monument or memorial somewhere on, adjacent to, or otherwise near it,\" he told the BBC.\nCongress gave an exemption most notably in 2003 to make way for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016.\nThe location that Trump has his eye on appears to be a designated area that allows for new memorials, but only if they are of \"preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States\".\nBut building a new memorial typically takes years and is unlikely to be ready before the nation's semiquincentennial.\n\"You have to look at the environmental impact of anything as well as all of these concerns about the aesthetics and the engineering so it usually takes several years to go through a process of designing a new memorial,\" Dr Henry said.\nThe approval process alone would take at least a year, according to Mr Bryant.\n\"If federal law is followed and the design goes through the NCPC and CFA review and approval process, to then be followed by construction, I have a hard time seeing how this arch will be designed, approved and constructed by July 4th of next year.\"\nAs for who will pay for the new memorial, the sponsors of an approved memorial have to raise the funds for it and federal law prohibits the use of government funds for such purposes. But that hasn't always been the case.\nIn 2005, Congress approved $10m for the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial to match what had been raised from private donors, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.\nWhat are Trump's other renovation plans?\nAccording to Axios, Trump has had models and dioramas built for other projects he is considering and has directed how and where new marble-tiled floors would be laid in the White House.\nHe has also taken world leaders, including Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a delegation of Florida lawmakers on tours of the White House to show them his changes, some of which mirror the aesthetic of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\nHe unveiled a \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" along the West Wing colonnade in September, displaying gold-framed portraits of himself and the 44 other presidents along the white exterior wall.\nIn place of former President Joe Biden's headshot, Trump instead hung a photo of an autopen signing his name. The move appeared to refer to Trump's claim that Biden's use of the autopen signalled his decline at the end of his presidency, although it is common for US presidents to use such a tool.\nCritics, including a guest essayist for the New York Times, have called his Oval Office remodel a \"Gilded Rococo Nightmare\".\nThe White House did not immediately respond on Wednesday to the BBC's request for further comment.",

    "body": "US Supreme Court weighs 'earthquake' ruling that could reshape political map\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in a case that could dramatically reshape the electoral politics of the American south.\nThe court heard a challenge to a central pillar of the Voting Rights Act, which was originally designed to protect the electoral power of black Americans in the face of state-sanctioned discrimination.\nAlthough the session was scheduled for only an hour, it stretched for more than twice as long, with the nine justices peppering lawyers in the case with questions.\nOnce the legal dust had settled, it appeared possible that a majority of the court was open to a substantial reinterpretation of the landmark civil rights era law.\nIf the challenge is successful, it could lead to the redrawing of congressional districts across the south that, by some estimates, could flip more than a dozen seats from Democratic to Republican.\nGiven the current narrow partisan divide in the US House of Representatives, such a ruling has the potential to give President Donald Trump's party a decisive advantage in retaining their majority in next year's midterm congressional elections.\nAccording to UCLA law Professor Rick Hansen, it would reverse decades of court precedent and amount to an \"earthquake in the American political system\".\nThe case in question arises from relatively modest beginnings – a lawsuit by black voters in Louisiana seeking to force the state to draw a second majority black congressional district. They argue this would more accurately reflect the state's demographic composition.\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits states from denying or limiting voting rights on the basis of race, skin colour or preferred language.\nOver the decades since that law's passage, the Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to require that states create \"opportunity districts\" that allow sizable minority populations to elect legislators in a proportion roughly equal to their share of the state's population.\nApproximately 31% of Louisiana's population is black, but only one of the state's six congressional districts has a black majority.\n- ANALYSIS: New Supreme Court term will reshape Trump's powers\n- IN DEPTH: How Trump is using the courts to get what he wants\nThe US Supreme Court initially agreed to consider whether Louisiana's electoral map complied with the Voting Rights Act – the kind of case it has regularly reviewed in the past. Two years ago, for instance, the court approved a second majority-minority district in Alabama, which subsequently elected a new black Democrat to Congress.\nOver the summer, however, the conservative majority on the court changed tack, announcing that it would use the Louisiana case to consider whether Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act violated the US constitution by mandating that states take race into account when drawing congressional districts.\nAs if to underline the tectonic shift such a move would represent, Louisiana's Republican officials flipped from defending their state's legislative map, which they had said was drawn to be in compliance with the Voting Rights Act, to asking the court to do away with the law's black-district requirements entirely.\nAnd the Trump administration joined the case to make a similar request.\nDuring oral arguments, Janai Nelson, who represents the original group of black Louisiana voters, warned that abandoning Voting Rights Act protections would be \"pretty catastrophic\".\n\"We only have the diversity we see across the south because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act,\" she said.\n\"It is an intervention that has been crucial to diversifying leadership and providing an ability of minority voters to have an equal opportunity to participate in the process.\"\nLouisiana's Solicitor General, J Benjamin Aguiñaga, countered that this was \"sky is falling\" rhetoric, and states would be reluctant to dramatically alter their congressional maps unless they put entrenched incumbents in more competitive districts.\nMore fundamentally, however, he argued that explicitly considering race when drawing legislative lines was unacceptable discrimination.\n\"The constitution does not tolerate this system of government-mandated racial balancing,\" he said.\nIn doing so, he employed the kind of legal reasoning that the Supreme Court's conservative majority relied on to strike down Harvard University's race-conscious admissions policies in a major education case two years ago.\n\"Section 2 is the last remaining major provision of the Voting Rights Act, and it is in tension with the court's colourblind jurisprudence,\" Guy-Uriel Charles, a professor at Harvard Law School, told the BBC.\n'They are siding with the state'\nWhile the Supreme Court is not expected to issue its decision in this case for months, Wednesday's oral arguments indicated there may be a majority on the court who favour discarding, or at least substantially paring back, the current Voting Rights Act requirements.\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, considered one of the court's swing votes, repeatedly expressed concern about whether there were any limits on how long the law's minority-district requirements might stay in effect. In 2013, the Supreme Court's had struck down a separate provision of the law – requiring federal approval for voting procedure changes – as no longer necessary.\nChief Justice John Roberts authored that ruling – and he is also seen as a potentially decisive vote in this case.\n\"The oral arguments are basically what we expected,\" Prof Charles said. \"The strong evidence from the argument is that they are siding with the state of Louisiana.\"\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch are also viewed as likely votes against the current interpretation of the voting law – and they said little on Wednesday to indicate otherwise.\nSix years ago, a narrow Supreme Court majority ruled that states can take political affiliation into account when drawing congressional districts – a move that has opened the door for states controlled by both Democrats and Republicans to craft sometimes contorted districts that maximise their partisan advantage.\nA spate of such \"redistricting\", as it's called, has played out recently, as conservative Texas has redrawn its congressional districts to maximise Republican advantage while Democratic California has sought to do likewise in response.\nConservative efforts at line drawing has often conflicted with Voting Rights Act provisions, however, as black voters traditionally voted Democratic by substantial margins – leading courts to rule that some of their districts infringe on black representation.\nThis amounts to \"reverse partisan gerrymandering\", the Trump administration lawyer said on Wednesday – a level of protection for black Democratic voters in the south that isn't afforded to white Democrats in states like West Virginia even though the political outcome was the same.\nFor decades, the US Supreme Court has disagreed. But if Louisiana has its way and the court issues its decision relatively quickly, the rush to redraw congressional lines – and cement a House of Representatives majority – may just be beginning.",

    "body": "Is Microsoft's first ever handheld Xbox console worth the wait?\nFor almost two decades, rumours have swirled about a handheld Xbox console to rival Nintendo and PlayStation.\nNow, it's finally here. The ROG Xbox Ally has been released worldwide, putting an end to the speculation.\nIt works natively with Xbox's Game Pass subscription service out of the box, meaning members will start off with hundreds of games in their library.\nBut its big trick is that it's really a portable computer running Windows, meaning most digital PC games people already own will work too - so long as they don't need a keyboard and mouse to play.\nIt's capable of running most modern games at a decent resolution, although all that tech doesn't come cheap. The handheld costs £499, or £799 for the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X.\nI've had my hands on the console for the past week and my experience has been positive - though the hardware certainly has its hiccups.\nSo, has it been worth the wait?\nWhat's it like?\nYou may not be surprised to hear it feels like a handheld Xbox.\nThe controller that makes up each side of the screen is comfortable to hold. Both thumb sticks have a solid feel to them, and though the face buttons are a bit plastic-y for my taste, the triggers on top of the machine feel great.\nSo far so good - but what about the games?\nThe first thing I did with the device was boot up something known for its vibrant colours - 2019's Persona 5 Royal - to see how good the screen looks.\nPersonally, I thought it looked fantastic.\nTech nerds like me may have had concerns that Microsoft went for an LCD display rather than the top-tier OLED displays.\nIn English, that means this portable Xbox doesn't have the best screen available on the market, which may seem like a questionable decision considering the price.\nBut LCD displays have gotten significantly better in recent years, and while it may not have the most vibrant colours possible, I was pretty blown away by how good Persona 5's deep reds looked on the handheld screen.\nThe game played well too, with no visible stutters or freezes - though this is surely to be expected for something that doesn't have the same graphical demands as modern titles.\nRemember, this isn't like buying a game for the Nintendo Switch 2, where you can expect things will work out of the box.\nThis is much more like buying a game for your home computer.\nIn other words, you don't know for sure whether a game will work or not.\nIt's definitely a mark against the handheld, though it's something PC gamers have been used to for years.\nAs much as this is a handheld Xbox, it could also be described as a portable computer running Windows - all the downsides of PC gaming are present here, but so are the upsides.\nFor example, Baldur's Gate 3, which is known for being particularly demanding at times, proved a challenge for the device on higher graphics settings, but because it's a PC game I could play around with the graphics settings to make it run smoothly.\nThe handheld performed admirably with modern games that don't require the best graphics - as you would expect for the price.\nFor example, I had no issues running some of this year's biggest games such as Hades II, Blue Prince and Hollow Knight: Silksong.\nThe device also worked well when playing older games - a similar experience I had to the Steam Deck when that launched in 2022 - but funnily enough, my biggest problems came getting some of them to start.\nFor example, I couldn't get 2001's Sonic Adventure 2 to work properly because of compatibility problems.\nThankfully, the handheld runs Windows 11 - so I knew how to fix the bug.\nWhat games are available?\nThe ROG Xbox Ally has got a massive library of potential games - many of which you may already own - thanks to being a portable PC.\nBut this thing was really built for Game Pass, Xbox's subscription service for games.\nGame Pass gives access to a massive history of classic games such as Halo, Gears of War and Fable, as well as modern titles including Call of Duty.\nWith many of these games, you don't need to download to the device - you can stream them over the cloud.\nOf course, if a game is being streamed from a Microsoft server somewhere, it isn't asking too much of the device to power it - meaning you can get some spectacular graphics from modern games like Modern Warfare 3 on the handheld.\nMeanwhile, there are subscription services from EA and Ubisoft also bundled into Game Pass Ultimate, giving you access to yet more games from the off.\nStill, despite Game Pass being front-and-centre on the device, it is not a requirement.\nRemember, this system is running Windows 11. That means any game made for PC is going to work here - even if it takes a bit of fiddling to make it run properly.\nThe harsh reality is that this is not 2001 anymore, when the rumours first started.\nHandheld PCs are no longer a rarity, and neither are handheld games machines.\nNintendo has cornered the market with the Switch - one of the best-selling consoles in history - and its Switch 2 has only improved what made the original great.\nSony has its own alternative product in the space, the PlayStation Portal, which can stream games from a connected PlayStation 5, and from the cloud too.\nAnd critically, Microsoft's new device comes three and a half years after Valve entered the PC gaming handheld market with the Steam Deck.\nThere's no question the ROG Xbox Ally compares well to many of these rivals in the space - but at the price point, you'd expect it to.\nUnfortunately, the very thing that makes the Xbox Ally X stand out compared to its rivals - the fact that it natively runs Windows - is at the same time its biggest tension point.\nOn the one hand, it allows for some fun things. It was entertaining to bring up Copilot while playing a game and ask for advice on what to do next - and to be told in a conversational way to talk to a character on-screen in front of me.\nBut you have to deal with Windows, which was hardly developed with a games console in mind. I had to sit and wait for several updates to install before I could even play the thing - hardly every child's dream on Christmas morning.\nSimply put, it's lacking that bit of extra polish you might expect at a premium price.\nBut I do think the people Microsoft is targeting with this product are hardly going to be turned away by a lack of polish. Especially as it has no real impact on the games.\nThe question is whether the allure of Game Pass on-the-go is going to be enough to justify the price of admission.\nIf the goal was to make something that feels like a handheld Xbox, Microsoft has certainly delivered on its promise - but has it come to market too late?\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "body": "As US shutdown starts to bite, how much could it hit economy?\nMichael Galletly, who works for the Department of Agriculture in Utah, sat down with his wife last week, combing through bills and spending more than two hours strategising how to make it through the government shutdown.\nThe outlook - uncertain.\n\"I could make it two months, maybe three lean, very lean months,\" said Mr Galletly, an IT management specialist put on unpaid leave this month, who is also president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 4016. \"But I don't know how long this thing is going to go.\"\nThe impasse has already snarled travel, delayed government approvals for permits and loans and shuttered some museums.\nNow as millions of federal workers across the government start to miss paycheques this week and respond by curtailing spending, analysts say the impact will start to reverberate more widely.\n\"We're reaching this critical inflection point in terms of the government shutdown and its ramifications for the broader economy,\" said Stash Graham, managing director of Graham Capital Management.\nThere are already signs that business and consumer confidence have dropped, in a possible indicator of economic weakness ahead.\nAnalysts said the delay or suspension of key releases of economic data, like the monthly jobs report, is adding to uncertainty, prompting firms to put spending decisions on hold and raising the risk of error as policymakers proceed without the best information.\nIn Utah, Mr Galletly said he had started to pull back his purchases in the lead-up to the shutdown, scrapping plans to buy a camper trailer, opting for a second-hand laptop for his daughter, and postponing plans to replace windows, including one that is leaking.\nNow, with the prospect of missing his first paycheque next week, he has applied for unemployment insurance, and reached out to the banks holding his mortgage and car loan, hoping for accommodation.\n\"A lot of people tend to look at these things and just hope for the best,\" he said. \"Having been through this before - this is my third government shutdown as a federal employee - I just can't afford to do that.\"\nThe impact of government shutdowns on the economy is typically temporary and limited - kind of like the disruption from a hurricane or major storm.\nAnalysts this year project a hit to quarterly growth of roughly 0.2 percentage points per week - roughly $15bn (£11.2bn) - much of which would be made up after the shutdown ends, when federal workers typically receive back pay.\nThis year's clash, however, carries unusual risks.\nThe Trump administration is threatening unprecedented action - including denying backpay to workers and permanent firings, which it started to initiate last week.\nAnd the fight is colliding with a slowing economy, in which businesses and households were already worried over tariffs, changes to immigration rules and earlier cuts to government spending.\n\"We've already rolled the dice a lot this year,\" said Michael Zdinak, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\"So while the impact of a short shutdown should be minimal, a protracted government shutdown is just another chance we're taking that could derail the trend of steady growth we've been on the last couple of years.\"\nIn recent days, the Trump administration has moved to blunt some of the economic pain, reshuffling government payments to ensure military members continue to receive pay and certain key food programmes maintain funding.\nBut those measures have also dimmed hopes of a resolution, removing some of the pressure points that had been expected to get the two sides talking about how to resolve their differences over spending.\n\"If the shutdown drags deep into next week, we will be venturing into uncharted territory,\" Wells Fargo analysts wrote recently, noting that most prior shutdowns, especially lengthy ones, have been far more limited in scope.\nS&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the unemployment rate could rise to as much as 4.8% if the shutdown continues until 18 October - a significant leap up from 4.3%.\nThe White House Council of Economic Advisers recently estimated that a month-long shutdown could lead to the loss of $30bn in consumer spending, in part due to the impact on government contractors, which number in the millions and are not eligible for back pay if their work is affected.\nAllison, whose husband is employed by the Defense Department in Ohio and is now working without pay, said her family of five had already cancelled its typical fall weekend getaway to Michigan, opting for a day trip instead to save money.\nThough Allison works for the state, her husband is the primary breadwinner.\nThe 43-year-old, who asked the BBC not to publish her full name due to concern it would expose her to political attacks, said her family has little wiggle room in its budget after the jump in living costs in recent years.\nWhen the shutdown started, they immediately reached out to the bank to ask if they could defer November's mortgage payment. She is worried an extended shutdown will force her children to drop out of extracurricular activities.\n\"If this continues through December, I don't know what we're going to do,\" she said.\nThe federal government employs people across the US, leaving few parts of the country unscathed.\nBut the Washington, DC region, which was already grappling with fallout from earlier cuts to government jobs and spending, is expected to face some of the most serious repercussions.\nDuring the similarly sweeping 2013 shutdown, consumer spending in the metro area overall dropped by 5 percentage points, compared to 0.7 percentage points over all, according to FiServ.\n\"The word shutdown doesn't put anybody in a good headspace to be a vibrant consumer,\" said Daniel Kramer, managing partner of the popular DC restaurants Duke's Grocery and Duke's Counter.\nHe said sales at Duke's Counter, which is located near the National Zoo, have dropped by more than 50% since the destination shut its doors to visitors a few days ago.\n\"It's not just federal workers and contractors who are affected here. It's the entire ecosystem,\" he said.",

    "body": "US campus activists relieved - and anxious - after Gaza ceasefire deal\nFor months last year, protests swept across major college campuses in the US as tens of thousands of students called for an end to the Israel-Gaza war.\nThe protests hit their peak in the spring, when pro-Palestinian activists staged sit-ins and launched encampments. Many of the demonstrations were peaceful, but others saw violent clashes with armoured police as students occupied buildings. More than 3,000 people were ultimately arrested.\nThe most common chant at these protests was \"ceasefire now!\". More than a year later, a ceasefire deal was inked, prompting US President Donald Trump to declare on Monday that \"the war is over\".\nFor many college students who had called for this moment since the war began on 7 October 2023, the news of a peace agreement triggered mixed emotions.\n\"My initial reaction was relief, knowing that my extended family, or all the people of Gaza, would be able to breathe,\" said Khalid, a student activist at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, who, like others, asked the BBC not to use his last name.\nDozens of his family members in Gaza were killed in the war, he said.\n\"On the other hand, there is a certain level of apprehension and feeling a bit hesitant to be fully optimistic for what comes next,\" he said.\nWhen Georgetown University student Ahmad first heard the news of the peace agreement, he said \"a sense of joy rushed over me\".\nBut he quickly added: \"You always have that uneasy feeling.\"\n\"Maybe this is the end. All I can do is hope,\" Mr Ahmad, who is of Palestinian descent, said.\nThomas, a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, where protests erupted last year before spreading nationwide, also expressed some scepticism.\n\"Even if there is a ceasefire right now, there's still so much work to be done,\" he told the BBC.\nHe added that, even though the biggest Columbia protests had long died down, the war in Gaza remained a difficult subject on campus.\n\"People are now afraid to speak out,\" he said. \"They think if they speak out about what they believe in, no matter what side they're on, that it's going to create more conflict in the social atmosphere.\"\n- ANALYSIS: Trump's role was decisive, but not a roadmap to peace\n- 24 hours with Trump on diplomatic tornado through Middle East\n- Israeli hostages reunite with families after two years\n- Palestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by Israel\nElisha Baker is also a student at Columbia University.

He welcomed the return of hostages held in Gaza following the peace agreement.\n\"The fact that we got 20 living hostages home, after two years in tunnels in captivity - that is cause for nothing but celebration,\" he said.\n\"It also pains me to think about the murderers and terrorists that are being released,\" he added, referring to the Palestinian prisoners and detainees freed by Israel under the terms of the peace agreement.\nThe release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge.\nLong before the recent ceasefire announcement, pro-Palestinian protest activity, which at one point engulfed an estimated 500 US universities, had mostly cooled.\nUniversities had come under pressure from the president, and Republican lawmakers, to crack down on pro-Palestinian protests. They argued universities were failing to fight antisemitism on campus.\nThree university presidents – from Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania - resigned in the wake of heated congressional hearings about the protests.\nThe Trump administration froze billions of dollars in funds from universities deemed non-compliant, and plainclothes agents detained pro-Palestinian student activists such as Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk.\nWhile the momentum and energy behind the protests may have waned, some students said their efforts had been worthwhile. Mr Ahmad, the student activist at Georgetown University, welcomed the announcement of a peace deal.\n\"Looking online, getting to see the smiles of people knowing that the crisis is over and that the war has been stopped - it's joyous,\" he said.\n\"The past few years, all you saw was carpet bombings, buildings destroyed and families lost.\"\nBut Mr Ahmad added that \"the threat of violence is never away\".\n\"There's always this uncertain feeling that (the war) is going to reignite again,\" he told the BBC.\nAt least seven people in Gaza were killed on Tuesday by Israeli drone strikes for crossing a boundary established by the ceasefire plan.\n\"I'm hesitant to fully accept that this is the end of the mass killing and the violence,\" said Mr Khalid from Earlham University.\nMr Baker, the pro-Israel student from Columbia University, also shared concerns about the fragility of Trump's 20-point peace plan.\n\"All of the innocents that were killed by Hamas whose bodies are still being held in captivity deserve to be laid to rest in a dignified way with their families paying their final respects,\" he said.\n\"The fact that Hamas hasn't done it is a violation of the agreement,\" he said.\nSome bodies of deceased hostages were returned to Israel this week, but about 20 are believed to still be in Gaza.\nMr Baker, who is co-chair of Columbia's pro-Israel public affairs committee Aryeh, said the advocacy for Israel must continue even after the ceasefire.\n\"The Jewish student movement, the Jewish people, we're going to continue to stand up for the Israel that we love, and for our right as a people,\" he said.\nMr Khalid, too, said that activism for Palestinians in Gaza must not waver.\n\"Now that there's a ceasefire, we're able to breathe a little bit and, of course, celebrate the immediate victory that is a ceasefire,\" he said.\n\"But it doesn't change the fact that we're going to continue working towards the rest of our goals.\"\nJadd Hashem, a student of Palestinian descent at the University of Texas, said: \"People can be perhaps pessimistic... but I think if anything, this is the most amount of optimism that any of us have felt in over two years.\"\nHe believes this will be the start of a lasting peace.\nMr Hashem is a member of the University of Texas chapter of Atidna International, an organisation focused on promoting Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.\nHe believes that cross-cultural communication is going to be key.\n\"Now is the opportunity we have to talk to one another, to have conversations, and ultimately, to push for dialog between Israelis and Palestinians, between Jews and Arabs,\" he said.\n\"We have to get to know one another and humanise one another to ensure that something like this conflict that we saw the last two years cannot happen again.\"",

    "body": "Ice hockey player Carter Hart to join Golden Knights after sexual assault acquittal\nIce hockey player Carter Hart - one of five players acquitted of sexual assault charges in Canada - has signed a new contract with National Hockey League (NHL) team the Vegas Golden Knights.\nThe players - all members of Canada's World Junior Championship gold-medal team - were accused of assaulting a woman known as EM in a hotel room in 2018 in the Canadian province of Ontario. They were cleared in July.\nThe NHL is composed of 32 teams in North America - 25 in the US and seven in Canada.\nHart is the first to sign a contract with an NHL team since it ruled the acquitted players could not join teams before 15 October, or play in games until December as part of a reinstatement process.\nSpeaking at a press conference, the 27-year-old said he was \"excited to move forward\".\n\"It's been a long road to get back to this point, to get back to playing the game of hockey, a game that I love, and I've been out of the game for a year and a half now,\" Hart said, adding that he had \"learned a lot\".\nThe Golden Knights said in a statement on X that they \"remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward\".\nMichael McLeod, one of the other players acquitted in the case, signed a three-year contract with Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League in Russia last week, the NHL reported. The other three remain free agents.\nHart, McLeod and fellow ice hockey players Dillon Dube, Alex Formenton and Cal Foote were all found not guilty of sexually assaulting EM following the eight-week trial that attracted significant attention in Canada. Hart was the only player to testify in his own defence.\nIn her ruling, the judge said she did not find EM's evidence \"credible or reliable\", and that \"the Crown cannot meet its onus on any of the counts\".\nThe central issue of the trial was whether EM, who was 20 at the time of the incident, had consented to every sexual act in the hotel room that night. The team had been attending a Hockey Canada gala.\nThe court heard that the woman had met the players at a bar and later went back to the hotel room to have consensual sex with Mr McLeod. Other players then entered the room and engaged in further sexual acts with her.\nLawyers for the players contended that she asked the men to have sex with her and they believed she gave consent.\nEM, however, testified that she was intoxicated and felt fearful of the men. While she had initially agreed to have sex with Mr McLeod, she testified that she did not agree to what unfolded afterwards.\nPrior to the trial, the case forced a reckoning within Hockey Canada - largely seen as Canada's voice for ice hockey on the international stage - after it emerged that the sports body had reached a quiet settlement with the alleged victim in 2022, and had set aside a fund to settle similar allegations.\nHockey Canada lost major sponsors, faced a parliamentary probe, and had its federal funding frozen in the aftermath. It later announced a plan to address \"systemic issues\" in the culture of ice hockey.\nIn a statement in September, the NHL said: \"The events that transpired after the 2018 Hockey Canada Foundation Gala in London, Ontario, prior to these players' arrival in the NHL, were deeply troubling and unacceptable.\n\"The League expects everyone connected with the game to conduct themselves with the highest level of moral integrity. And, in this case, while found not to have been criminal, the conduct of the players involved certainly did not meet that standard.\"",

It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage.\nTitan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.\nIn August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was \"preventable\" and criticised OceanGate's \"critically flawed\" safety practices.\nStockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive and co-founder, operated the Titan on its final journey.\nThe passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, were deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding.\nDesigned and built by OceanGate, the Titan was 6.7m (22ft) long with a passenger compartment made of carbon fibre, with titanium used in its domes and some other segments.\nThe doomed submersible which imploded at a depth of 3,363m (11,033ft) - the Titanic wreck is located at 3,880m - was the second version of the craft. OceanGate had condemned the first version following testing.\nDuring its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate.\nWhile some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment \"where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored\".\nOne technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as \"mission specialists\" as opposed to passengers.\nUnder US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible.\nThe technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: \"… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation.\"\nIn a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: \"If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away\".\nOceanGate has permanently wound down its operations since the incident.\nIn its report, the NTSB discovered that a contributing factor to the implosion was that US and international voluntary guidance and US small passenger vessel regulations \"were insufficient to ensure OceanGate adhered to established industry standards\".\nThe NTSB has recommended that the US Coast Guard commissions a study into how so-called pressure vessels which carry people are assessed and, if changes are suggested, regulations be updated.",

    "body": "Spotify working on AI music tools with major record labels\nSpotify, the world's biggest music streaming service, has announced it is working with major labels on using artificial intelligence (AI) in a \"responsible\" way.\nThe firm said it wanted to make AI tools which \"put artists and songwriters first\" and respect their copyright.\nThe streaming giant will license music from the three record labels which make up the vast majority of the industry: Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group.\nHowever, critics say adding more AI to the platform would result in less streaming revenue for human artists.\nAlso part of the deal are music rights firm Merlin and digital music company Believe.\nIt is unclear exactly what these AI tools will look like, but Spotify says it has already started working on its first products.\nSpotify said it recognised there was a \"wide range of views on use of generative music tools within the artistic community\" and it planned to allow artists to choose if they wanted to participate.\nIt comes as a number of high-profile musicians such as Dua Lipa, Sir Elton John and Sir Paul McCartney have spoken out against AI companies training generative AI tools on their music without payment or permission.\nSpotify said it would make sure artists, songwriters and rights holders were \"properly compensated for uses of their work and transparently credited for their contributions\".\nThese would be through \"upfront agreements\" and not \"asking for forgiveness later\".\n\"Technology should always serve artists, not the other way around,\" said the firm's co-president Alex Norstrom.\nNew Orleans-based artist management company MidCitizen Entertainment said AI has \"polluted the creative ecosystem\".\nManaging Partner Max Bonanno said AI-generated songs have \"diluted the already limited share of revenue that artists receive from streaming royalties\".\nBut the announcement was welcomed by Ed Newton-Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights.\n\"Lots of the AI industry is exploitative - AI built on people's work without permission, served up to users who get no say in the matter,\" he told BBC News.\n\"This is different - AI features built fairly, with artists' permission, presented to fans as a voluntary add-on rather than an inescapable funnel of AI slop.\n\"The devil will be in the detail, but it looks like a move towards a more ethical AI industry, which is sorely needed.\"\nAI-generated Spotify\nSpotify has always maintained it does not create any music itself, using AI or otherwise.\nHowever, it does use the technology to create custom playlists, such as the \"daylist\" and its AI DJ.\nIt also hosts AI-generated music on its platform, and recently announced it was cracking down on artists who did not disclose the use of AI or who used it to impersonate real artists.\nFor example, a viral AI-generated song using voice clones of Drake and The Weeknd was removed from the streaming service in 2023.\nThe company also said AI is now used in many stages of the song-writing process - such as autotune, mixing and mastering.\nThe Beatles' Grammy Award-winning last single Now and Then, released in 2023, used AI to clean up John Lennon's voice from an old audio recording.\n\"We've been consistently focused on making sure AI works for artists and songwriters, not against them,\" said Warner Music Group boss Robert Kyncl.\n\"That means collaborating with partners who understand the necessity for new AI licensing deals that protect and compensate rightsholders and the creative community.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "body": "Why AI is being trained in rural India\nIndia has long been a centre for outsourced IT support, with cities like Bangalore or Chennai being traditional hubs for such work.\nBut in recent years firms have been moving that work into much more remote areas, where costs for staff and space are lower.\nThe trend is know as cloud farming, and AI has given it another boost with numerous smaller towns hosting firms working on AI.\nMohan Kumar is one worker who has benefited from that. He lives in the small town of TN Palayam, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.\n\"My role is in AI annotation. I collect data from various sources, label it, and train AI models so they can recognize and predict objects. Over time, the models become semi-supervised and can make decisions on their own,\" he says.\nSo does Mr Kumar think he is missing out, by not being in a big city?\n\"Professionally, there is no real difference. Whether in small towns or metros, we work with the same global clients from the US and Europe, and the training and skills required are the same,\" says Mr Kumar.\nMr Kumar works for Desicrew, which is headquartered in Chennai. Founded in 2005 it was a pioneer in cloud farming.\n\"We realised that instead of forcing people to migrate to cities in search of jobs, we could bring jobs to where people already live,\" says Mannivannan J K, the chief executive of Desicrew .\n\"For too long, opportunities have been concentrated in cities, leaving rural youth behind. Our mission has always been to create world-class careers closer to home, while proving that quality work can be delivered from anywhere.\"\nDesicrew does all sorts of outsourced work including software testing for start-up firms, building datasets to train AI, and moderating content.\nAt the moment 30 to 40% of its work is AI related, \"but very soon, it will grow to 75 to 100%,\" says Mr J K.\nMuch of that work is transcription - turning audio to text.\n\"Machines understand text far better,\" he explains.\n\"For AI to work naturally, machines must be trained to understand variations in how people speak. That's why transcription is such a crucial step, it forms the foundation for machines to comprehend and respond across languages, dialects, and contexts.\"\nDoing such work in a smaller town is not a disadvantage, Mr J K says.\n\"People often assume rural means underdeveloped, but our centres mirror urban IT hubs in every way – secure data access, reliable connectivity, and uninterrupted power. The only difference is geography. \"\nAround 70% of his workforce are women: \"For many, this is their first salaried job, and the impact on their families is transformative – from financial security to education for their children,\" says Mr J K.\nFounded in 2008, NextWealth was also an early mover in cloud farming.\nHeadquartered in Bangalore, it employs 5,000 staff in 11 offices in smaller towns across India.\n\"Sixty percent of India's graduates come from small towns, but most IT companies hire only from the metros. That leaves behind a huge untapped pool of smart, first-generation graduates,\" says Mythily Ramesh, co-founder and managing director of NextWealth.\n\"Many of these students are first-generation graduates. Their parents are farmers, weavers, tailors, policemen - families who take loans to fund their education,\" she says.\nNextWealth started with outsourced work from the back offices of big companies, but five years ago moved into artificial intelligence.\n\"The world's most advanced algorithms are being trained and validated in India's small towns,\" says Ms Ramesh.\nAround 70% of its work comes from the US.\n\"Every AI model, from a ChatGPT-like system to facial recognition, needs vast amounts of human-labelled data. That is the backbone of cloud-farming jobs.\"\nShe thinks there is plenty more work to come.\n\"In the next 3–5 years, AI and GenAI will create close to 100 million jobs in training, validation, and real-time handling. India's small towns can be the backbone of this workforce.\"\nShe is hopeful that India can remain a hub for such work.\n\"Countries like the Philippines may catch up, but India's scale and early start in AI sourcing gives us a five to seven-year advantage. We must leverage it before the gap narrows,\" she says.\nKS Viswanathan is a technology advisor, and formerly worked at India's National Association of Software and Service Companies, the trade association for outsourcing firms.\n\"Silicon Valley may be building the AI engines, but the day-to-day work that keeps those engines reliable increasingly comes from India's cloud farming industry,\" he says.\n\"We are truly at a tipping point. If cloud farming continues to scale, small-town India could well become the world's largest hub for AI operations, just as it became the hub for IT services two decades ago.\"\nBut success is not guaranteed.\nWhile NextWealth and Desicrew both say they have access to reliable and secure internet connections, Mr Viswanathan says that is not always the case in India's smaller towns.\n\"Reliable high-speed internet and secure data centres are not always at par with metros, which makes data protection a constant concern.\"\nEven if good connections are in place, work needs to be done to reassure clients.\n\"The bigger challenge is the perception rather than a technical one. International clients often assume small towns cannot meet data security standards, even when the systems are robust. Trust has to be earned through delivery.\"\nBack at NextWealth, Dhanalakshmi Vijay \"fine-tunes\" AI. For example, if it confuses two similar looking items, like a blue denim jacket and a navy shirt, she will correct the model.\n\"These corrections are then fed back into the system, fine-tuning the model so that the next time it sees a similar case, it performs better. Over time, the AI model builds up experience, just like updating software with regular patches to make it more accurate and reliable,\" says Ms Vijay.\nSuch work has an effect in the real world.\n\"It's me and team who indirectly train the AI models to make your online shopping experience easy and hassle free,\" she says.\n- This article was updated on 16 October 2025 to clarify where Mohan Kumar lives.",

    "body": "Scottish data centres powering AI already using enough water to fill 27 million bottles a year\nData centres powering artificial intelligence (AI) in Scotland are using enough tap water to fill 27 million half-litre bottles a year, according to data obtained by BBC News.\nAI systems such as the large language models (LLMs) that power OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini require warehouses full of specialist computers.\nThe equipment is power-hungry, consuming large amounts of energy, but they also use tonnes of water in their cooling systems to stop the servers overheating.\nFreedom of Information data shows the volume of tap water used by Scotland's data centres has quadrupled since 2021.\nThere are currently 16 data centres in Scotland and this number is set to increase in the years to come.\nSuch centres have been powering the digital world for years - running everything from movie streaming to online banking - but the boom in generative AI tools has rapidly increased the amount of energy and water they use.\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland News, Scottish Water described the increase in tap water used by data centres as \"significant\" - although it pointed out that it still only amounts to about 0.005% of the water supply.\nAs AI booms - with 60% of the UK population already using it - Scottish Water wants the sector to look at sustainable alternatives such as wastewater systems.\n\"We would like to try to look for other alternative solutions rather than using precious tap water\", operations manager Colin Lindsay said.\nData centres are being built all over the world, especially in the US, and people in Scotland using AI tools will not necessarily being using servers in Scotland.\nHowever, many more data centres are expected to come to Scotland in the near-future, including a massive AI industrial park near Irvine in Ayrshire which was confirmed last month.\n\"If we had to supply all that with tap water, then that would be a real concern,\" Mr Lindsay said.\nThe BBC understands that the majority of data centres in Scotland currently use \"open loop\" systems, which need a constant supply of mains water.\nHowever, the industry is moving to towards more efficient methods such as \"closed loop\", meaning they would recirculate a fixed amount of water.\nMr Lindsay said: \"Open loop systems use enormous amounts of water.\n\"We're working with developers on a case-by-case basis to explore sustainable water sources to reduce demand on public drinking water.\"\nHe said closed-loop cooling systems could increase energy use so Scottish Water were encouraging open-loop systems near wastewater treatment works.\nThese would use treated effluent to supply the volumes of water needed and minimise energy use.\nIn the UK alone, it's estimated that another 100 data centres will be built over the next few years to meet the demand for AI processing.\nThe tech industry does not release figures on water consumption - and all Scottish data centres contacted for this article did not respond to our inquiries.\nIt is estimated that 10-50 responses using AI model GPT-3 could consume 500ml of water.\nExperts at the University of Glasgow said the figures, revealed by BBC News, suggested that the water consumed by data centres in Scotland was equivalent to every person in the country drinking an extra 2.48 litres a year.\nBy another measure, it amounts to more than 27 million 500ml water bottles.\nThe university modelling also found the carbon footprint of these data centres could be the equivalent of every person in the country driving up to an extra 90 miles, or 145 kilometres, every single year.\nThis is before any expansion in data centres in Scotland.\nAnd it does not account for the environment impact in the rest of the world of Scottish AI users.\n\"These figures are very significant,\" said Prof Ana Basiri, director of university's Centre for Data Science and AI.\n\"There is a huge amount of carbon dioxide emissions and water use related to data centres that we often forget about because it is not a very visible thing,\" she said.\nMany data centres are privately funded by US tech giants, such as Google and Microsoft, and major investment firms.\nBut most current owners do not share data about their environmental impact, something Prof Basiri said needed to change.\nShe added: \"We can't really measure this because, of course, there is not necessarily a big mandate from the government to report on the detail of the energy or water use of data centres or other big tech companies that exist and that's a massive challenge.\"\nProf Basiri said one way to ensure that data centres were more sustainable would be to set carbon targets for companies and impose tax penalties for exceeding them.\nThe academic said the power used by an AI tool, such as ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, was about 13 times higher than a simple Google search.\nShe said ordinary people could play their part by considering their \"AI footprint\".\nProf Basiri added: \"For example, reducing the number of times we go to these AI chatbot systems when a Google search would be efficient or considering how you use image generation, or what you attach to an email.\"\nThe UK is already thought to be the third-largest nation for data centres behind the US and Germany.\nThe UK government has made clear it believes data centres - which have been designated critical national infrastructure alongside the emergency services and healthcare systems - are central to Britain's economic future.\nDespite concerns, Scotland has also been touted as a prime location for the development of \"green\" data centres.\nThis is because of its cool climate, abundance in renewable energy, and efficient grid.\n'Considerable thought'\nOpenAI, the owner of ChatGPT, said it gives \"considerable thought\" to supporting sustainability efforts and \"water-positive\" goals.\nThe company said it had several global projects under way in this area.\nThis included a data centre in Norway which will \"run entirely on renewable power\" and is \"expected\" to use closed loop systems.\nIt added that it believes AI will also be \"instrumental\" in tackling climate change by \"accelerating scientific discovery\".\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"Alongside Team Scotland partners, the Scottish government is supporting initiatives to transform Scotland into a global centre for AI – driven by our capacity for renewable energy generation, strong local tech ecosystems and easy access to local talent and world-class academia.\n\"However it is vital that the sector grows sustainably in a way which doesn't impact on Scotland's natural resources or net zero ambitions.\"\nThey added Scottish Water was a statutory consultee on all data centre planning applications.\nThe spokesperson concluded: \"Developers are encouraged to adopt measures such as 'closed loop' water systems, which seek to reuse water in data centres and minimise demand or use sustainable alternatives such as the use of treated final effluent as a sustainable water source.\"",

There were no reported injuries.\nLFB has said it \"suspects\" lithium-ion batteries and electrical products are responsible for a \"growing number\" of fires inside bin lorries and at waste disposal sites.\nLambeth Council praised the refuse collectors for their \"swift action\" dealing with the fire and for keeping the public safe.\nOne local resident told the BBC that she discovered the fire on her route to work and said the scene was \"frightening\".\nKate Burt, who is a journalist who writes online about waste related issues, said: \"It was terrifying to see the guys who collect our bins each week risking their lives battling that huge, burning truck.\"\nShe described how the refuse collectors worked hard to get the fire under control but said the blaze \"quickly got worse\".\n\"Toxic smoke filled the street. Half an hour earlier I'd have been with my kids. The whole truck could easily have exploded,\" she said.\nMs Burt added: \"This fire really brought home to me how dangerous it can be when people throw away everyday items like vapes, mobile phones or other things with lithium batteries in them.\"\nLFB said fires that originate from batteries can be \"very time consuming\" for firefighters to deal with.\nIt said it has been attending fires, caused by batteries, within bin lorries, as well as recycling centres and they all require \"a high level of resources\" to put out.\n\"We've also seen the detrimental environmental and societal impact these fires can have on local communities,\" it said.\nLFB advised that people check their local council's website for the safest way to dispose of lithium-ion batteries.\nThe brigade has said the exact cause of the bin lorry fire in Brixton is unknown.\nLambeth Council said there have been a \"number of fires\" linked to lithium batteries in the borough, and said that \"proper disposal is key\".\nCouncillor Rezina Chowdhury said: \"Our teams go over and above to help keep our residents safe as their swift action here shows, and I thank them for their huge efforts.\n\"To support the fire brigade, we ask people not to put batteries in bins.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "body": "ChatGPT will soon allow erotica for verified adults, says OpenAI boss\nOpenAI plans to allow a wider range of content, including erotica, on its popular chatbot ChatGPT as part of its push to \"treat adult users like adults\", says its boss Sam Altman.\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Mr Altman said upcoming versions of the popular chatbot would enable it to behave in a more human-like way - \"but only if you want it, not because we are usage maxxing\".\nThe move, reminiscent of Elon Musk's xAI's recent introduction of two sexually explicit chatbots to Grok, could help OpenAI attract more paying subscribers.\nIt is also likely to intensify pressure on lawmakers to introduce tighter restrictions on chatbot companions.\nOpenAI did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.\nMr Altman said OpenAI had previously made ChatGPT \"pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues\".\nThese changes were announced in a blog post in August, which no longer appears on OpenAI's website.\n\"We realise this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right,\" Mr Altman posted on Tuesday.\nHe said ChatGPT could soon relax the restrictions \"now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools\".\nHe added: \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.\"\nThe changes come after OpenAI was sued earlier this year by parents of a US teen who took his own life.\nThe lawsuit filed by Matt and Maria Raine, who are the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.\nThe family included chat logs between Adam, who died in April, and ChatGPT that show him explaining he has suicidal thoughts.\nIn a statement given at the time, OpenAI told the BBC it was reviewing the filing.\n\"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Raine family during this difficult time,\" the company said.\nChild safety concerns\nWritten erotica does not require age verification in the UK under the Online Safety Act.\nHowever, pornographic images, including those generated by AI, would require users to prove they are over 18.\nIn the US, critics say OpenAI's decision to allow erotica on the platform shows the need for more regulation at the federal and state levels.\n\"How are they going to make sure that children are not able to access the portions of ChatGPT that are adult-only and provide erotica?\" said Jenny Kim, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner.\nMs Kim is involved in a lawsuit against Meta that claims the company's Instagram's algorithm harms the mental health of teen users.\n\"OpenAI, like most of big tech in this space, is just using people like guinea pigs,\" she said.\nIn April, TechCrunch reported that OpenAI was allowing accounts in which a user had registered as a minor to generate graphic erotica.\nOpenAI said at the time that the company was rolling out a fix to limit such content.\nA survey published this month by the nonprofit Centre for Democracy and Technology (CDT) found that one in five students report that they or someone they know has had a romantic relationship with AI.\nOn Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill passed by the state legislature that would have blocked developers from offering AI chatbots companions to children unless the companies could guarantee the software wouldn't breed harmful behaviour.\nNewsom said it was \"imperative that adolescents learn how to safely interact with AI systems\" in a message that accompanied his veto.\nAt the nationwide level, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an inquiry into how AI chatbots interact with children.\nIn the US Senate last month, bipartisan legislation was introduced that would chatbot users to file liability claims against their developers.\nWhy introduce erotica?\nMr Altman's announcement on Tuesday comes as sceptics have been questioning the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies.\nOpenAI's revenue is growing, but it has never been profitable.\nTulane University business professor Rob Lalka, author of The Venture Alchemists, said the major AI companies find themselves in a battle for market share.\n\"No company has ever had the kind of adoption that OpenAI saw with ChatGPT,\" Prof Lalka told BBC News.\n\"They needed to continue to push along that exponential growth curve, achieving market domination as much as they can,\" he added.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "body": "Prince Andrew gives up his Duke of York title as Epstein allegations refuse to fade\nPrince Andrew gives up his Duke of York title as Epstein allegations refuse to fade\nLONDON (AP) — Prince Andrew said Friday he is giving up his royal title of the Duke of York and other honors after his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein returned to the headlines.\nAndrew, younger brother of King Charles III, said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace that “the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family.”\n“With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,” Andrew said in his statement Friday. “As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.”\nEpstein-related allegations\nIt’s the latest fall from grace for the 65-year-old prince, who had already stepped down from public life in 2019 over his links to Epstein despite his denials of any wrongdoing.\nNews that he will be ditching his title came in the wake of the release of excerpts of an upcoming posthumous memoir from Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and had sex with Andrew when she was 17. The memoir is due to be published on Tuesday.\nGiuffre died by suicide in April at the age of 41. In the memoir, she details alleged encounters with Prince Andrew, who she sued in 2021. Andrew denied her claims and said he didn’t recall having met her.\nInterview misstep\nAndrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.\nHis attempt to refute Giuffre’s allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals — such as disputing Giuffre’s recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring — and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.\nWithin days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties. Giuffre sued him and the case was settled in 2022 for an undisclosed sum. A statement filed in court said that the prince acknowledged Epstein was a sex trafficker and Giuffre was “an established victim of abuse.”\nFamily repercussions\nAs well as no longer using the title of the Duke of York, a long-established title that was gifted to him by his mother Queen Elizabeth II at his wedding to Sarah Ferguson in 1986, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth.\nAndrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson will also no longer use the title of Duchess of York. Their children, Beatrice and Eugenie, will remain princesses.\nAndrew’s chaotic marriage to Ferguson, widely known as Fergie, lasted a decade though the two remain close, living together at a 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle.\nFerguson, herself, has also been embroiled in Epstein-related allegations. Last month, a number of charities severed ties with her after British newspapers published an email that she reportedly wrote to Epstein, describing him as a “supreme friend.’’\nOnce the golden boy\nAndrew had been the poster boy of the royal family for many years, and his romantic links to a number of models and starlets during his youth were widely chronicled in the British press.\nHis star status within the royal family was at its peak after he flew in multiple missions as a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when British forces sailed to the south Atlantic to eject the Argentine military that had invaded the U.K. overseas territories.\nQuestions over financing\nAndrew has long been criticized for his opulent, globe-trotting lifestyle.\nWhen he stopped being a working royal, Andrew lost his primary source of income. Questions have been raised since how he has funded his lifestyle, including the running of his Royal Lodge home.\nEarlier this year, court documents showed that his damaged reputation and need for money led him to become entangled with a suspected Chinese spy, businessman Tengbo Yang, who was barred from the U.K. in 2023.\nDominic Hampshire, a former senior aide to Andrew, told a special immigration appeals commission how he had arranged meetings between the prince and Yang in an effort to drum up some cash.\nWhile Andrew has said he never discussed anything sensitive with the suspected spy and that he ceased contact with him as soon as concerns were raised, he retreated from view after the news emerged last December.\n___\nBrian Melley contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Israel received coffin of missing hostage handed over to Red Cross, prime minister’s office says\nIsrael received coffin of missing hostage handed over to Red Cross, prime minister’s office says\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel received the remains of another hostage from Gaza on Friday, the prime minister’s office said, a handover from Hamas as the militant group worked to shore up a ceasefire by using bulldozers in a search for bodies under the rubble in the war-scarred enclave.\nThe Israeli military and security forces received the coffin from the International Committee of the Red Cross inside the Gaza Strip, and it was to be sent to the Ministry of Health’s National Center for Forensic Medicine in Israel.\nIsraeli authorities said the family of the deceased would be notified first after a formal identification process.\nThe handover came after Hamas’ military wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, said the remains were that of an “occupation prisoner,” suggesting that they belonged to an Israeli rather than one of the hostages of several other nationalities also taken in Gaza.\nThe handover of hostages remains, called for under the ceasefire agreement, has been among the key sticking points — along with aid deliveries, the opening of border crossings into Gaza and hopes for reconstruction — in a process backed by much of the international community to help end two years of devastating war in Gaza.\nA warning from Trump\nHamas has said it is committed to the terms of the ceasefire deal, including the handover of bodies. This week, Hamas has handed over to Israel the remains of nine hostages, along with a 10th body that Israel said wasn’t that of a hostage.\nThe effort to find bodies followed a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that he would green-light Israel to resume the war if Hamas doesn’t live up to its end of the deal and return all hostages’ bodies, totaling 28.\nThe Israeli military and Shin Bet security service, which received the remains, insisted that “Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages.”\nHamas has said some hostages’ remains were in tunnels or buildings that were destroyed by Israel, and insisted heavy machinery is required to dig through rubble to retrieve them. The group blamed Israel for the delay, saying it had not allowed any new bulldozers into Gaza.\nMost heavy equipment in the territory was destroyed during the war triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel, leaving only a limited amount as Palestinians try to clear massive amounts of rubble across Gaza.\nOn Friday, two bulldozers plowed up pits in the earth as Hamas searched for hostages’ remains in Hamad City, a complex of apartment towers in the city of Khan Younis. Israeli forces repeatedly bombarded the towers during the war, toppling some, and troops conducted a weeklong raid there in March 2024, fighting militants.\nWhile much focus has been on the handover of hostages’ remains, Hamas has urged mediators to increase the flow of aid into Gaza, expedite the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and start reconstruction.\nIt also said work should “start immediately” to set up a committee of Palestinian independents who will run Gaza and called for Israeli troops to continue pulling back from agreed-upon areas.\nThe ceasefire plan introduced by Trump had called for all hostages — living and dead — to be handed over by a deadline that expired Monday. But under the deal, if that didn’t happen, Hamas was to share information about deceased hostages and try to hand them over as soon as possible.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel “will not compromise” and demanded that Hamas fulfill the requirements laid out in the ceasefire deal about the return of hostages’ bodies.\nObstacles to retrieving bodies\nHamas has assured the U.S. through intermediaries that it’s working to return dead hostages. The retrieval of bodies is hampered by the scope of the devastation and the presence of dangerous, unexploded ordnance. The militant group has also told mediators that some bodies are in areas controlled by Israeli troops.\nHamas released all 20 living Israeli hostages on Monday. In exchange, Israel freed around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nIn Israel, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum — which groups many families of hostages — said they will continue holding weekly rallies until all remains are returned.\nIsrael has also returned to Gaza the bodies of 90 Palestinians for burial. Israel is expected to turn over more bodies, though officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned.\nA Palestinian forensics team examining the remains said some of the bodies showed signs of mistreatment.\nIsrael’s campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the territory. Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross.\nFrance says international force for Gaza is in the pipeline\nFrance said it’s working with Britain and the U.S. to propose a U.N. resolution in coming days that would provide a framework for an international force for Gaza.\nFrench Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pascal Confavreux said Thursday that Arab countries want a U.N. mandate for the force.\nArab countries are expected to be among those contributing troops to the force, which will oversee Egyptian-trained Palestinian police.\nNew insights into U.S. response to Israel’s strike in Qatar\nAlso on Friday, new details emerged about the Trump administration’s initial surprise about -- and subsequent response to -- an Israeli strike last month on the headquarters of Hamas’ political leadership in Qatar. The attack came just as its top figures gathered to consider a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nIn excerpts of an interview with CBS program 60 Minutes to be aired in full on Sunday, Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said he and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, felt “a little bit betrayed” by Israel’s attack.\nKushner said he thought Trump “felt like the Israelis were getting a little bit out of control in what they were doing, and that it was time to, it was time to be very strong and stop them from doing things that he felt were not in their long-term interests.”\nWeeks later, hosting Netanyahu at the White House, the president announced the initial contours of the planned ceasefire agreement.\nWait for a large infusion of aid into Gaza goes on\nMeanwhile, in Gaza, the flow of aid remains constrained because of continued closures of crossings and restrictions on aid groups.\nUnited Nations data on Friday showed 339 trucks have been offloaded for distribution in Gaza since the ceasefire began a week ago. Under the agreement, some 600 humanitarian aid trucks would be allowed to enter each day.\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid in Gaza, reported 950 trucks — including commercial trucks and bilateral deliveries — crossing on Thursday and 716 on Wednesday, the U.N. said\nTom Fletcher, the U.N. humanitarian aid chief, visited a World Food Program bakery in Deir al-Balah on Friday, and said in a social media post that U.N. humanitarian teams were executing a 60-day plan to massively ramp up aid. He warned that the “challenges ahead are immense,” and urged the opening of more crossings to allow more aid in\nSince last Saturday, WFP has sent more than 280 trucks, weighing some 3,000 metric tons, into Gaza to support bakeries, nutrition programs and general food distributions, the U.N. food aid agency said.\nNahed Sheheiber, the head of Gaza’s private truckers’ union, which organizes pickups of aid after Israeli inspection, says improved security in Gaza has helped prevent looting or gangs intercepting aid convoys — even if there has been no significant increase of supplies arriving since the ceasefire. He said only 70 trucks went in Thursday.\nGaza’s more than 2 million people are hoping the ceasefire will bring relief from the humanitarian disaster caused by Israel’s campaign. Throughout the war, Israel restricted aid entry to Gaza — sometimes halting it altogether.\nFamine was declared in Gaza City, and the U.N. says it has verified more than 400 people who died of malnutrition-related causes, including more than 100 children.\nIsrael says it let in enough food, accusing Hamas of stealing much of it. The U.N. and other aid agencies deny the claim.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations; Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey; and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed.",

He was 74.\nFrehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, according to his agent.\nFamily members said in a statement that they are “completely devastated and heartbroken” but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.\nKiss, whose hits included “Rock and Roll All Nite” and “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” was known for its theatrical stage shows, with fire and fake blood spewing from the mouths of band members dressed in body armor, platform boots, wigs and signature black-and-white face paint.\nKiss’ original lineup included Frehley, singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, tongue-wagging bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss. Frehley’s is the first death among the four founding members.\nBand members took on the personas of comic book-style characters — Frehley was known as “Space Ace” and “The Spaceman.” The New York-born entertainer and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.\n“We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” Simmons and Stanley said in a joint statement. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS’s legacy.”\nBorn Paul Daniel Frehley, he grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at age 13. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.\nKiss was especially popular in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to become a marketing marvel. “Beth” was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.\nAs the Kennedy Center’s new chairman, President Donald Trump named Kiss as one of this year’s honorees.\nIn 2024, the band sold their catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be over $300 million.\nFrehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years. He left the band in 1982, missing the years when they took off the makeup and had mixed success. Stanley later said they nearly replaced Frehley with Eddie Van Halen, but Vinnie Vincent assumed the lead guitar role.\nFrehley performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley’s Comet.\nBut he rejoined Kiss in the mid-1990s for a triumphant reunion and restoration of their original style that came after bands including Nirvana, Weezer and the Melvins had expressed affection for the band and paid them musical tributes.\nHe would leave again in 2002. When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.\nSimmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss “no longer deserve to wear the paint.” “The makeup is earned,” he added. “Just being there at the beginning is not enough.”\nFrehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands including Mötley Crüe and Poison.\n“Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we’ve done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,” Poison front man Bret Michaels said on Instagram.\nHarder-edged bands like Metallica and Pantera were also fans, and even country superstar Garth Brooks joined the band members for a recording of their “Hard Luck Woman” on a 1994 compilation.\nFrehley would appear occasionally with Kiss for shows in later years. A 2023 concert at Madison Square Garden was billed as the band’s last. While Stanley and Simmons said they would not tour again, they’ve been open to the possibility of more concerts, and they’ve stayed active promoting the group’s music and memorabilia.",

The department also accused the AP of having “deliberately obscured the facts,” despite the agency having not provided AP with the information it accused the news organization of obscuring.\nSteve Rios of Oceanside, California, told San Diego station KNSD that his parents inspired him to enlist in the Marines. He said they came to the U.S. from Mexico more than 30 years ago and have washed cars and cleaned houses for his whole life.\n“It was just making them proud, right? I’ve seen all the struggles they’ve gone through,” Steve Rios told the station. “The least I could do, right, and serve this country and try to, you know, put some time in.”\nSteve Rios said he and his parents were picking up his younger sister and her husband, who is also a Marine, at Pendleton on Sept. 28, as they have done that every weekend for the past few months while she is expecting her first child. After stopping at the gate, ICE officials arrived to detain both parents, later releasing them with ankle monitors. He said his father was deported Oct. 10.\nThe Rios family told the station the parents had no criminal record, had pending green card applications sponsored by Steve and authorization to work.\nIn response to inquiries from AP, Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, issued a statement Tuesday that read, “Under President (Donald) Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem, if you break the law — including domestic violence and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon — you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.”\nThe statement did not say anything about Esteban Rios, including whether he was arrested or charged with any crime or if he had any immigration history.\nWhen AP followed up to ask if Esteban Rios and his wife had criminal histories, Luis Alani, a communications strategist at ICE, wrote, “By statute, ICE has no information on these aliens. To clarify, there is no information we can release.”",

    "body": "‘No Kings’ protests return as Trump ramps up authoritarian practices, organizers say\nBig crowds of protesters are expected Saturday in thousands of places around the U.S. in opposition to what some are characterizing as increasingly authoritarian practices by President Donald Trump.\nIt’s the second “No Kings” protest and third mass movement against the administration this year, and it comes amid an intensifying conflict between federal law enforcement and protesters nationwide.\nSome conservative politicians have condemned the protests as “Hate America” rallies, while others say that it represents a “patriotic” fight for First Amendment rights.\nHere is what to expect on Saturday.\nOrganizers aim to boost political engagement\nEzra Levin, a leading organizer of Saturday’s protests, said the demonstrations are a response to what he called Trump’s “crackdown on First Amendment rights.”\nLevin, the co-executive director of the nonprofit Indivisible, pointed to Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, his unprecedented promises to use federal power to influence midterm elections, restrictions on press freedom and retribution against political opponents.\nHe said those steps cumulatively represented a direct threat to constitutionally protected rights.\nProtests are planned for more than 2,500 locations nationwide — from the country’s largest city, New York, to small unincorporated, rural communities like East Glacier Ridge, Montana, with roughly 300 residents.\nOrganizers will consider the day a success, Levin said, if people are galvanized to become more politically involved on an ongoing basis.\nMostly peaceful protest in June\nThe last “No Kings” protest took place on June 14 in thousands of cities and towns across the country, in large part to protest a military parade in Washington that marked the Army’s 250th anniversary and coincided with Trump’s birthday. “No Kings” organizers at the time called the parade “coronation” that was symbolic of what they characterized as Trump’s growing authoritarian overreach.\nConfrontations were isolated and the protests were largely peaceful.\nPolice in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted the week prior and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. Officers in Portland also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening.\nOne protester was killed during the Salt Lake City march in June. A safety volunteer shot at a person allegedly pointing a rifle at demonstrators, but inadvertently struck and killed protester Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, a beloved fashion designer.\nUtah organizers focus on healing\nFour months later, no one has been charged. Experts have said state gun laws may shield both the shooter and the man who brandished a rifle but didn’t fire shots.\nJamie Carter, an organizer of Saturday’s rally, said Utah activists considered not participating in this round of “No Kings” demonstrations, but “we also felt that we really had to get back out there.”\nOrganizers are not affiliated with the groups who put on the June demonstration that turned deadly. Safety volunteers will be present but unarmed, and all have received de-escalation training, said Carter, of Salt Lake Indivisible. Attendees have been asked not to bring weapons.\n“We really want this to be a very uplifting, happy event of people coming together in a community to kind of try to erase and replace some of the bad memories,” she said.\nConcerns about large political demonstrations remain heightened in Utah, where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was also assassinated during a speaking event last month.\nCrackdown on protests\nTrump’s crackdown against protests, especially in Democratic cities, has intensified since the June marches. He has since sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tenn. His efforts to deploy troops to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, have stalled in federal court.\nOrganizers in Chicago are expecting tens of thousands of demonstrators at a popular Lake Michigan park, followed by a downtown march.\nFederal immigration agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Chicago, the nation’s third largest city, with increasingly aggressive tactics since September. Protests have been frequent and well attended in recent weeks, and have boiled over in intense clashes outside a suburban federal immigration processing center.\n“People are angrier. It feels so much more immediate,” said Denise Poloyac with Indivisible Chicago. “They’re very concerned about what’s happening in Chicago and around the country.”\nThe “No Kings” organizers have led numerous virtual safety trainings leading up to the protests with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is listed as an official partner on the “No Kings” website.\nThe trainings informed viewers about their rights during protests — such as whether you are required to carry ID or if wearing a mask is allowed (both vary according to each state) — and emphasized de-escalation techniques for encounters with law enforcement.\nEach official protest has a safety plan, which includes designated medics and emergency meeting spots.\nMixed response from elected officials\nThe protests have already drawn swift condemnation from some of the country’s top politicians, with House Speaker Mike Johnson dubbing the event the “Hate America rally” at a news conference on Wednesday.\nSome state leaders, like Texas’ Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, have decided to activate the National Guard ahead of the protests.\n“Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property,” Abbott said in a statement.\nDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom struck a more optimistic tone, saying he hopes Californians turn out in large numbers and remain peaceful. He said Trump “hopes there is disruption, there’s some violence” that he can exploit.\n___\nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City; Christopher Weber in Los Angeles; Juan A.

    "body": "How Trump’s approval shifted after the ceasefire in Gaza, according to a new AP-NORC poll\nHow Trump’s approval shifted after the ceasefire in Gaza, according to a new AP-NORC poll\nWASHINGTON (AP) — More U.S. adults support President Donald Trump’s handling of the conflict in Israel after he brokered a ceasefire deal in Gaza, a new AP-NORC poll finds — but his approval ratings on domestic issues remain weak.\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals that Trump’s apparent success on the world stage has not yet improved his overall standing at home. In interviews, even some of his voters said he needs to do more to address issues such as the economy, health care and immigration.\n“It’s kind of cool he’s bringing peace, but I’m like, ‘You kind of need to worry about your American people instead of bringing peace to the world first,’” said Justin Sanders, a 31-year-old Republican from Birmingham, Alabama, who voted twice for Trump.\n“We need the inflation to go down,” added Sanders, who works as a driver for DoorDash. “I’m tired of sitting here struggling going day by day trying to figure out if I’m going to eat or not.”\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 9-13, before the hostages and prisoners were freed in Israel, but after the ceasefire deal was announced. The tenuous ceasefire in Gaza has held this week even as major questions remain about the U.S. plan for the region and whether the peace can be sustained.\nAt the same time, Trump faces major hurdles at home with a U.S. government shutdown now in its third week, prices remaining too high for many Americans and millions more impacted by health care cuts and hospital closures.\nIn the new poll, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president overall, unchanged from September.\nTrump’s approval on Israeli-Palestinian conflict rises\nAbout half of U.S. adults, 47%, approve of how Trump is handling the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That’s an increase from 37% in September, and it’s driven primarily by Democrats viewing Trump more positively on this issue.\nJack Bornstein, of Alpharetta, Georgia, a 61-year-old independent who typically votes for Democrats, said he was pleased the Israeli hostages were released as part of the deal Trump helped negotiate.\n“I give him credit for that. That’s probably the only thing I can say is positive for him,” Bornstein said, pointing to concerns about rising grocery prices, health care and Trump’s character.\nHowever, separate AP-NORC polling from July indicates that Americans are much more likely to say domestic issues — such as the economy, health care, taxes, government spending and immigration — are “extremely” or “very” important to them as compared with the situation in the Middle East.\nIn the July poll, only about 4 in 10 said the Middle East was at least “very” important to them personally, compared with about 9 in 10 who said that about the economy.\nMost disapprove of Trump’s handling of economy, immigration, health care\nOn domestic issues, Americans don’t believe that Trump is doing particularly well — even on immigration, a signature issue for the Republican president.\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the way Trump is handling immigration, which is in line with his September measure, but down slightly from the beginning of his second term.\nOn the economy, the chief concern for many, only about one-third of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s performance. The figure has stayed steady throughout his second term.\nOne of Trump’s weakest issues is health care, a topic that’s taken center stage during the ongoing government shutdown.\nAbout 3 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s leadership on health care, in line with September. Almost all Democrats disapprove of his work on health care, but so do about 8 in 10 independents and about one-third of Republicans.\nAlison Weaver, a 62-year-old independent from Roanoke, Virginia, said Trump’s second term has been “a debacle.”\nShe criticized his “gestapo tactics” on immigration and laughed out loud when asked about his performance on health care.\n“It’s horrifying,” Weaver said.\nMost say the country is going in the wrong direction\nTrump’s domestic challenges come on the eve of a new election season in which voters in New Jersey and Virginia will elect new governors next month, while several other states will host municipal elections.\nTrump’s weak numbers could create problems for Republican candidates who have been wary of distancing themselves from the GOP president. The new poll might also raise concerns for incumbents in either party, since about 7 in 10 U.S. adults say things in this country are heading in the wrong direction.\nThat’s down slightly from September, shortly after conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination, when about three-quarters of Americans said the country was going in the wrong direction. Republicans are less likely to say the country is headed in the wrong direction than they were last month, returning closer to levels before Kirk’s assassination. Democrats and independents have not changed significantly.\nDean Grace, a 73-year-old Democrat from Duluth, Minnesota, said he has very few positive things to say about Trump.\n“I will give him some credit for the ceasefire, although claiming peace in the Middle East is a stretch,” he said. “My issues are that, as a Christian, I find nothing to agree with my president about morally.”\n___\nPeoples reported from New York.\n___\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Oct. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.",

It was not immediately clear what would be done with the survivors, who the defense official said were being held on a U.S. Navy vessel.\nThe official and other person confirmed the strike and the seizing of survivors on the condition of anonymity because the attack had not yet been publicly acknowledged by Trump’s administration.\nTrump has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.\nSome legal experts have questioned the legality of the approach. The president’s use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicolás Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars said this week.\nTrump on Friday appeared to confirm reports that Maduro has offered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to try to stave off mounting pressure from the United States. The New York Times last week first reported about the effort by the Maduro government.\nVenezuelan government officials have also floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office, according to a former Trump administration official. That plan was also rejected by the White House, the AP reported.\n“He’s offered everything,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters at the start of his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “You know why? Because he doesn’t want to f—- around with the United States.”\nFor the survivors of Thursday’s strike, the saga is hardly over. They now face an unclear future and legal landscape, including questions about whether they are now considered to be prisoners of war or defendants in a criminal case.\nReuters was first to report news of the strike late Thursday.\nThe strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they have not received sufficient information on how the strikes are being conducted. A classified briefing for senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month did not include representatives from intelligence agencies or the military command structure for South and Central America.\nHowever, most Senate Republicans stood behind the administration last week when a vote on a War Powers Resolution was brought up, which would have required the administration to gain approval from Congress before conducting more strikes.\nTheir willingness to back the administration will be tested again. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with Sens. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, is bringing another resolution that would prevent Trump from outright attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Seung Min Kim, Aamer Madhani and Stephen Groves contributed reporting.",

Let both claim Victory, let History decide!”\nLater, soon after arriving in Florida, where he’s spending the weekend, Trump urged both sides to “stop the war immediately” and implied that Moscow keep territory it’s taken from Kyiv.\n“You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it’s too complicated,” Trump told reporters. “You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.”\nThe comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by Trump. In recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war.\nAfter meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could win back all the the territory they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who had previously insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war.\nZelenskyy after Friday’s meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations. He sidestepped directly answering a question about Trump nudging Ukraine to give up land.\n“The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak,” Zelenskyy said when asked by reporters about Trump’s social media post, which he hadn’t seen.\nTrump tone on the war shifted after he held a lengthy phone call with Putin on Thursday and announced that he planned to meet with the Russian leader in Budapest, Hungary, in the coming weeks.\nThe president also signaled to Zelenskyy on Friday that he’s leaning against selling him long-range Tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the Ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table.\nZelenskyy at the start of the White House talks said he had a “proposition” in which Ukraine could provide the United States with its advanced drones, while Washington would sell Kyiv the Tomahawk cruise missiles.\nBut Trump said he was hesitant to tap into the U.S. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help Ukraine beat back Russia’s invasion.\n“I have an obligation also to make sure that we’re completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what’s going to happen in war and peace,” Trump said. “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We’d much rather have the war be over to be honest.”\nIn an interview with Kirsten Welker of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Zelenskyy suggested the door was not closed.\n“It’s good that President Trump didn’t say ‘no,’ but for today, didn’t say ‘yes,’” he said.\nZelenskyy also said “we need Tomahawks” because “it’s very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.”\nTrump’s latest rhetoric on Tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the Ukrainians. In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to selling Ukraine the Tomahawks, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship.\nBut following Thursday’s call with Putin, Trump began downplaying the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.)\nZelenskyy had been seeking the Tomahawks, which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump’s calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously.\nPutin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with the Tomahawks “won’t change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries,” according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser.\nIt was the fifth face-to-face meeting for Trump and Zelenskyy since the Republican returned to office in January,\nThe president said Friday it was “to be determined” if Zelenskyy would be involved in the upcoming talks in Hungary — suggesting a “double meeting” with the warring countries’ leaders was likely the most workable option for productive negotiations.\n“These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody,” Trump added.\nBut Zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward Putin “is not about feelings.”\n“They attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. They don’t intend to stop,” Zelenskyy added. “So they are an enemy. It is not about someone just hating someone else. Although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy. Undoubtedly.”\nTrump, going back to his 2024 campaign, insisted he would quickly end the war, but his peace efforts appeared to stall following a diplomatic blitz in August, when he held a summit with Putin in Alaska and a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies.\nTrump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin. But the Russian leader hasn’t shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine.\nAsked Friday if he was concerned that Putin was stringing him along, Trump acknowledged it was a possibility but said he was confident he could handle the Russian leader.\n“I’ve been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,” Trump said. He added, “I think I’m pretty good at this stuff.”\n___\nMegerian reported from West Palm Beach, Fla. AP writer Susie Blann in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed reporting.",

Financial terms were not released.\n“I feel like I am on the podium, this is amazing,” said Eddy Cue, Apple‘s senior vice president of services. “Our vision for Apple TV, we wanted to deliver customers the best story from the most creative storytellers. We launched in 2019, we started with nine original series, and now we’ve got a deep library of over 300 shows and movies and 1000s of hours.\n“And everyone on Apple TV in the US will now get Formula 1,” he added. “They’re going to get everything that Formula 1 has to offer.”\nApple plans to air F1 on Apple TV as well as amplify the series across Apple News, Apple Maps, Apple Music, Apple Sports and Apple Fitness+. Apple TV will also host all practice, qualifying, sprint sessions and races.\nSelect races and all practice sessions throughout the season will also be available to watch for free in the Apple TV app. F1 TV Premium, F1’s own premier content offering, will continue to be available in the U.S. via an Apple TV subscription and will be free to Apple subscribers.\nApple TV is available in over 100 countries and regions on over 1 billion screens, including iPhone and other products, including PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles.\nCue said Apple’s reach will only help grow F1 in the United States, which currently hosts races in Miami, Las Vegas and this weekend in Austin, Texas.\n“The many millions of Apple TV viewers that we have in the U.S., we know many of them are Formula 1 fans, hopefully, and we know that many of them are not yet,” he said. “We’re going to be able to bring (new fans) to the table right away, that’s very much low-hanging fruit.”\nThe deal with Apple was praised by Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports and the Cadillac Formula 1 team that will debut next season.\n“As we build a truly American team, Apple’s scale, influence, marketing, and most importantly, deep commitment to innovation will bring us to American audiences in exactly the ways we want to reach them,” Towriss said.\nStefano Domenicali, F1 president and CEO, noted the potential for growth.\n“This is an incredibly exciting partnership for both Formula 1 and Apple that will ensure we can continue to maximize our growth potential in the U.S. with the right content and innovative distribution channels,” Domenicali said. “We have a shared vision to bring this amazing sport to our fans in the U.S. and entice new fans through live broadcasts, engaging content, and a year-round approach to keep them hooked.”\nDomenicali also praised the coverage and growth ESPN brought the series over eight seasons.\n“We’re incredibly proud of what we and Formula 1 accomplished together in the United States and look forward to a strong finish in this final season,” ESPN said in a statement. “We wish F1 well in the future.”\n___\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

There is no history of violence between Aston Villa and Maccabi fans.\nHowever, Maccabi fans have been increasingly in the spotlight over the past year or so, partly linked to the war in Gaza. Most notably, Maccabi fans clashed violently with city residents in Amsterdam last season when the team visited for a Europa League game against Ajax.\nDozens were arrested and five people were treated in hospital following the night of violence which was condemned as antisemitic by authorities and which also saw some supporters of the Israeli team chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium.\n“The Maccabi fan base has an egregious track record of racist violence that led them to being banned from the city of Amsterdam,” said Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.\nIn Italy this week there was a heavy police presence, including snipers on the roof of the stadium, for a World Cup qualifier between Italian and Israeli national teams after authorities placed the game in the highest risk category. Around 10,000 people attended a pro-Palestinian march earlier in the day. Later around 50 people — with their faces covered — clashed with police, who used water cannons and tear gas to try to disperse them.\nThe game at Villa Park will be Maccabi’s first away match in the Europa League, European soccer’s second-tier competition, since pro-Palestinian protests took place at the stadium in Thessaloniki, Greece, when the club played PAOK on Sept. 24. About 120 Maccabi fans traveled to Greece for that game and were held behind a police cordon before entering the venue.\nEuropean soccer’s governing body UEFA was weighing a vote to suspend Israeli teams from its competitions before that was overtaken this month by the ceasefire in Gaza. Though Israel isn’t in Europe, its national team and its clubs play in UEFA competitions, as many Muslim nations in the Middle East and Asia boycott the country.\nUEFA says fans should be able to attend\nFollowing Thursday’s ban announcement, UEFA urged British authorities to ensure the Israeli team’s fans could go to the match, while Football Supporters Europe, the governing body’s recognized advisory and liaison group, said it is opposed to blanket bans for away fans.\n“Such away travel ban would be a first in England, and it’s extremely worrying to see the local police take that route when evidence shows that it doesn’t solve anything,” it said in a statement. “To the contrary, it creates additional risk by not offering a controlled and secured environment inside the stadium.”\nMaccabi Tel Aviv chief executive Jack Angelides, expressed “dismay about what this potentially is signaling.”\n“I don’t use this term lightly but people ask, ‘What does antisemitism look like?’ And it’s often manifested as part of a process … in other words small events leading up to something that’s more sinister,” he told the BBC.\nAntisemitic incidents in the U.K. have hit record levels following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and Israel’s ensuing military campaign in Gaza, according to Community Security Trust, a charity that provides advice and protection for British Jews. Earlier this month, a synagogue was targeted in a car and knife attack that left two congregants dead.\nEmily Damari, a British Israeli dual national who was held captive by Hamas for more than a year before being released in January, and who supports Maccabi as well as English Premier League team Tottenham Hotspur, condemned the ban.\n“Football is a way of bringing people together irrespective of their faith, color or religion, and this disgusting decision does the exact opposite,” she said. “Shame on you. I hope you come to your senses and reconsider.”\n___\nJames Robson in London and Graham Dunbar in Geneva contributed to this report.",

Evan McPherson had four field goals, the last a 36-yarder with seven seconds remaining to put the Bengals on top and snap a four-game losing streak.\nThe 40-year-old Flacco completed 31 of 47 passes in his second Cincinnati start after being acquired Oct. 7, and outdueled 41-year-old Aaron Rodgers in only the third regular-season game between starting quarterbacks in their 40s.\nBengals fans were chanting “Thank you Cleveland! Thank you Cleveland!” when Flacco appeared on Prime Video’s postgame set on the field, which brought a smile to coach Zac Taylor’s face.\n“Our fans are happy, and I’m happy,” Taylor said. “It’s a big victory. We needed this. It had been a long time since we won.”\nCincinnati led most of the second half, but Rodgers gave Pittsburgh a 31-30 advantage with 2:31 remaining on a 68-yard touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth.\nOn second-and-20, Rodgers rolled left and found Freiermuth open downfield. The fifth-year tight end caught the ball at the Bengals 36 after getting separation from safety Geno Stone and scored his second touchdown.\n“I told him to be ready. I saw something on the pictures on the sideline in the first half. So at halftime I pulled him aside. I had a nice shot down the middle,” said Rodgers, who went 22 of 32 for 244 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions.\nThat set the stage for the 23rd fourth-quarter comeback of Flacco’s 18-year career.\nFlacco led the Bengals (3-4) 52 yards in eight plays, including completions of 15 and 18 yards to Ja’Marr Chase got Cincinnati into Pittsburgh territory. Flacco then found Tee Higgins for a 28-yard gain to the Steelers 5 with 1:39 remaining to put the Bengals well within McPherson’s range.\n“It’s very fun. It’s because of games like this that we do what we do,” Flacco said.\nChase had a franchise-record 16 receptions for 161 yards and a TD, making him the fourth receiver in NFL history with two games of at least 14 catches in a single season. Higgins finished with six catches for 96 yards and a score. Noah Fant also had a TD reception.\nThe Bengals scored on seven of their last eight possessions and won for the first time since Joe Burrow went down with a toe injury Sept. 14. Jake Browning struggled in his three starts after Burrow’s injury, prompting the Bengals to acquire Flacco.\n“Last week, it seemed we had finally figured out how it was going to be with Flacco and the offensive line. And today we showed what we’re capable of,” Chase said.\nChase Brown had 108 rushing yards on 11 carries, the second 100-yard game of his career.\nFreiermuth had four catches for 106 yards for the Steelers (4-2). Jaylen Warren ran for 127 yards on 16 carries.\n“I just thought the first half we allowed them to run the ball too much,” Tomlin said. “Then we turned the ball over a couple of times, and that just kind of set a negative trajectory. We’re fighting uphill the rest of the way.”\nBengals rally in second quarter\nPittsburgh jumped out to a 10-0 lead on Chris Boswell’s 41-yard field goal early in the second quarter before Rodgers’ passes was picked off on consecutive drives.\nCincinnati scored a touchdown in the first half for the first time in five games with 4:42 remaining in the first half when Flacco found Chase in the left corner of the end zone for an 8-yard score.\nThe Bengals then converted both of Rodgers’ interceptions into points. On the first play of the next drive, Jordan Battle picked off a deep ball intended for Metcalf at the Bengals 24. Three plays later, Flacco’s 29-yard quick slant to Higgins gave Cincinnati its first lead since the first quarter of the Week 4 Monday night game at Denver.\nAfter DJ Turner picked off Flacco’s pass along the left sideline at the Cincinnati 30 with 40 seconds remaining, McPherson booted a 49-yarder to make it 17-10 at halftime.\nAll day and night\nThe Steelers scored a touchdown on an opening drive for the third time this season when Jonnu Smith caught a 10-yard pass from Rodgers with 10:51 remaining in the first quarter.\nRodgers held onto the ball for 8.598 seconds before connecting with Smith in the end zone. It was Rodgers’ longest time to throw on a completion since the NFL’s Next Gen Stats started tracking in 2016.\nInjuries\nBengals: DE Trey Hendrickson was inactive due to a hip injury he suffered during the first half of last week at Green Bay.\nUp next\nSteelers: Host Green Bay in a prime-time game Oct. 26.\nBengals: Host the New York Jets on Oct. 26.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

And it’s really important that I share my story, so they don’t have to.”\nHe and Spears’ son Preston is now 20 and his brother Jayden is 19. They have little relationship with their mother.\nFederline was a 26-year-old backup dancer for other major pop acts when he coupled with Spears in 2004. Their courtship, two-year marriage and divorce took them through one of the most intense celebrity media frenzies in modern history. Federline was ruthlessly roasted as a loser hanger-on, especially after he released his own deeply mocked hip-hop album.\n“I wasn’t just famous — I was infamous,” he writes in the book, which will be released on the new audiobook first platform Listenin.\nHe told the AP he long considered writing the book, but recently got serious about it.\n“I picked it up and put it down quite a lot over probably a five-year period,” he said. “I think that it’s a very good description of me, who I am, the father I’ve become, the husband I am, the ex-husband I am.”\nKey revelations from Kevin Federline about Britney Spears\n— Federline describes the night he and Spears first connected at a Hollywood nightclub, and how they hooked up hours later in a hotel bungalow: “Britney turned around, slipped off her underwear and started kissing me, tearing at my clothes with both hands. We stumbled toward the bed while I struggled to kick my pants off my ankles. This. Is. Happening. OK, sorry. Calm down, that’s as detailed as I’m going to get.”\n— He writes that a “San Andreas-level seismic shift in my reality” followed a few hours later when he left the hotel with Spears and dozens of paparazzi cars followed them.\n— He describes the night before their wedding, when Spears called her ex Justin Timberlake, seeking closure: “She never really got over him. She might’ve loved me, but there was something there with Justin that she couldn’t let go of.”\n— Federline said seeing Spears drinking while pregnant “tripped the silent alarms in my head.” He later was outraged when he saw her doing cocaine when the boys were still breastfeeding, saying “are you seriously going to go home after this and feed them like you don’t have a body full of drugs?”\n— He writes that Preston told him Spears mercilessly mocked him and once punched him in the face.\n— He says the boys began refusing to visit her when they were 13 and 14, and later told him stories that “shook me to the core.” “They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep — ‘Oh, you’re awake?’ — with a knife in her hand.”\nSpears’ response to Federline’s book\nSpears responded with a statement on her social media accounts. She said Federline has engaged in “constant gaslighting.”\n“Trust me, those white lies in that book, they are going straight to the bank and I’m the only one who genuinely gets hurt here.” She said, adding that “if you really know me, you won’t pay attention to the tabloids of my mental health and drinking.”\nShe also addressed her relationship with her sons:\n“I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys. Relationships with teenage boys is complex. I have felt demoralized by this situation and have always asked and almost begged for them to be a part of my life. Sadly, they have always witnessed the lack of respect shown by (their) own father for me.”\nAn attorney for Spears did not respond to a request for comment.\nFederline’s life, and thoughts about Spears’ life\nFederline writes about growing up in Fresno, California, and finding “my therapy and my purpose” through dance.\nHe reminisces about his first big tour, with Pink, and working with Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child and Michael Jackson. He details wrestling with John Cena in the WWE and appearing in a self-mocking Super Bowl commercial.\nFederline says Preston and Jayden are living on their own as young adults, and have both been working on making music that makes him proud.\nHe weighs in on Spears’ dissolved court conservatorship, saying it was necessary but hurt most of the people involved. He said the fans who fought to free her left an unfortunate legacy.\n“The Free Britney movement may have started from a good place, but it vilified everyone around her so intensely that now it’s nearly impossible for anyone to step in,” he writes.\nHe says in the book that he wrote it in part as a public plea for her to get more help.\n“I’ve lost hope that things will ever fully turn around,” he writes, “but I still hope that Britney can find peace.”",

All it took was Taylor Swift wearing a vintage T-shirt.\nSwift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new “The Life of a Showgirl” album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift’s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium’s director of content strategy.\nThe aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.\n“We definitely had a little Taylor Swift dance party in the office yesterday afternoon when we hit the goal,” she said.\nThe aquarium began accepting back-orders and by Friday afternoon it had raised more than $2 million, according to its website.\nHow Swift acquired the T-Shirt that was last produced more than 32 years ago — when she was just 3 years old — remains a mystery.\nShe and fiancé Travis Kelce have been documented visiting nearby Carmel, but MacDonald said the aquarium is not aware of the couple having been in their shop.\nMacDonald said the staff has had fun speculating about Swift’s interest in the T-shirt.\nWhen Taylor announced the release of her new album on Kelce’s podcast “New Heights” a couple of weeks ago, the couple had a little banter about how he loves otters and loves sending her videos of the furry sea creatures.\n“One of my favorite theories is that we have a sea otter on our exhibit whose name is Opal and she was named by the fans through an online poll, and I wonder if Taylor Swift may have been one of the people that voted for the name Opal,” MacDonald said, adding that opal is Kelce’s birthstone and that Opalite is the name of one of Swift’s songs.\nWhatever the reason, the aquarium and Liberty Graphics, an employee-owned company printing the T-shirts, are reveling in the moment.\n“They’re a company based in Maine who were as taken by surprise as us, but who are also as delighted to have this opportunity to be part of this amazing moment that does so much for sea otters and for ocean conservation,” MacDonald said.\nLiberty Graphics will use 100% cotton in the T-shirts and water-based ink, which is more ocean-friendly and sustainable, she said.\n“We’re also working to make sure that the packaging doesn’t use plastic,” she added.\nThe company of 50 employees normally produces 1,500 shirts a day, said Matt Enos, a company manager.\nEnos said that beginning Monday the company will probably have to focus most of its resources on fulfilling T-shirt orders from Swifties.\n“We definitely didn’t envision something this big but it’s a pretty good problem to have,” he said.",

    "body": "Wall Street rises to finish its best week in 2 months after bank stocks stabilize\nNEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street cruised to the finish of a winning week on Friday after banks recovered some of their sharp losses from the day before.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 238 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%.\nThe gains capped the best week for the S&P 500 since early August, but it was a roller-coaster ride. Indexes careened through several jarring swings as worries built about the financial health of small and midsized banks, as well as the souring trade relationship between the United States and China.\nSome of the nervousness around U.S.-China trade tensions eased on Friday after President Donald Trump said that very high tariffs he threatened to put on Chinese imports are not sustainable.\nTrump also told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that he would meet with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, at an upcoming conference in South Korea. That’s counter to an earlier, angry posting he made on social media, where he said there seemed to be “no reason” for such a meeting.\nBank stocks, meanwhile, stabilized on Friday after several reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, including Truist Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp and Huntington Bancshares. That helped steady the group, a day after tumbling on worries about potentially bad loans.\nThe two banks at the center of Thursday’s action also rose to trim some of their sharp losses.\nZions Bancorp., which is charging off $50 million of loans where it found “apparent misrepresentations and contractual defaults” by the borrowers, climbed 5.8% following its 13.1% loss.\nWestern Alliance Bancorp, which is suing a borrower due to allegations of fraud, rose 3.1% after its 10.8% fall on Thursday.\nScrutiny is rising on the quality of loans that banks and other lenders have broadly made following last month’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing of First Brands Group, a supplier of aftermarket auto parts.\nOne of the financial firms that could feel pain because of First Brands’ bankruptcy, Jefferies Financial Group, rose 5.9% Friday. It had come into the day with a loss of roughly 30% since mid-September.\nThe question is whether the lenders’ problems are just a collection of one-offs or a signal of something larger threatening the industry. Uncertainty is high following a long stretch where many borrowers were able to stay in business, even with the weight of higher interest rates. And with prices soaring to records for all kinds of investments, the appetite for risk may have gotten too high.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon addressed the issue on an earnings conference call with analysts earlier this week.\n“When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Dimon said. “Everyone should be forewarned on this one.”\n“But banks make loan loss provisions and typically have plenty of capital to keep the cockroaches from causing structural damage,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Based on earnings and data so far, it looks like this isn’t an infestation” and that the potential canary in the coal mine “is probably passed out and not dead.”\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 34.94 points to 6,664.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 238.37 to 46,190.61, and the Nasdaq composite gained 117.44 to 22,679.97.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields steadied following their sharp slides from Thursday, which came as investors rushed into investments seen as safer.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.00% from 3.99% late Thursday.\nGold also pulled back from its latest record as more calm seeped through the market.\nThe price for an ounce fell 2.1% to $4,213.30, but it’s still up roughly 60% for the year so far. Besides worries about tariffs, gold’s price has also surged on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and concerns about the massive amounts of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are building.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes dropped across much of Europe and Asia after Wall Street’s weakness from Thursday moved westward.\nGermany’s DAX lost 1.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng sank 2.5% for two of the world’s bigger moves.\n___\nAP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.",

    "body": "After billions in failed big bets, funders and schools are turning to this small education nonprofit\nEducation is the civil rights issue of our time. That’s what Leslie Cornfeld decided after a decade advising New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and President Obama’s two education secretaries — and seeing how few low-income students went to the universities that lead to high-paying jobs.\nCornfeld said she spent part of her time in the Obama administration visiting the nation’s Title I high schools, those with a high percentage of low-income students. She recalled: “We heard the same themes over and over again from principals, district leaders and students. That even the most talented, hard-working scholars — in rural communities, poor urban communities, Native American communities — cannot get on the radar of more selective universities.”\nAnd even if they could get on their radar, students did not believe that they were college-ready or college-worthy, Cornfeld said. Meanwhile, when she and her Washington colleagues met with higher education leaders, they repeatedly claimed, “We wish that we could find talented lower income scholars but we just can’t find them.”\nFor Cornfeld, this made no sense, since universities seemed to have had no trouble finding the very best athletes, often from low-income backgrounds, to play on their teams. Why couldn’t they find the very best low-income students to fill their classrooms?\nIn 2019, with $50,000 in startup funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, she launched the National Education Equity Lab, a nonprofit “founded on the belief that talent is evenly distributed but opportunity is not.”\nCornfeld also was informed by a 2017 analysis of more than 30 million college students, led by economist Raj Chetty, which showed that the most selective colleges in the U.S., enabling the highest career opportunities and incomes, were the least socioeconomically diverse.\nCornfeld decided to connect the dots and bring elite universities into non-elite schools. By fall 2019, with a staff of three, the Lab was delivering Harvard College poetry class to two dozen high schools. The Lab simultaneously developed a range of supports: connecting professors with students by Zoom; training high school teachers as course co-teachers; and hiring college undergraduates as course teaching fellows and mentors in applying to and navigating college.\nOver the past five years, the Equity Lab, now called the National Education Opportunity Network, or NEON, reports it has brought 60 college credit-bearing courses from 17 universities to more than 40,000 high school students in 33 states — with 80 percent of students passing the courses. NEON is currently in every Title I school in Jackson, Mississippi, 120 Title I schools in New York City and has plans to matriculate 1 million Title I high schools into online college courses within a decade.\nShould NEON’s goal be achieved, it would surpass the number of low-income students annually taking Advanced Placement tests. Sixty percent of A.P. exams taken by low-income students in 2023 scored too low for college credit, a statistic that has not budged in 20 years, according to reporting from the New York Times.\n“We are a very different animal than A.P.,” Cornfeld said. “We are serving low-income, underresourced scholars and this model was developed for them. We are bringing colleges into the schools and changing the culture.”\nA lean nonprofit\nAlthough the National Education Opportunity Network has large ambitions, it remains small in two significant ways. The nonprofit has only 32 full-time staff, and its annual revenue in 2024 was just $7.5 million.\nCarnegie has provided NEON two more grants — $200,000 in 2021 and $3 million this year. And over the past six years, NEON has attracted funds from the Bill & Melinda Gates, NBA, Apollo and Morgan Stanley foundations, among others.\nThe Lab also has attracted support from individuals. The biggest benefactor among them is venture capitalist Henry McCance.\n“My VC background very much focuses on backing the best people,” McCance said, noting Cornfeld’s background as a federal civil rights prosecutor. McCance was also impressed by the NEON’s model, which connects existing, paid-for college courses with existing, paid-for government employees at high schools.\n“That gave them the ability to really start influencing thousands of students with relatively limited resources,” McCance said.\nWhile some large-scale private interventions — like Mark Zuckerberg’s $100 million investment in Newark public schools and the Gates Foundation’s $1 billion Small Schools Initiative — have stumbled, McCance noted that NEON has fared better by starting small and proving its model.\n“Then they could go to other universities, other school districts and show them the success they had in the last year and build on it,” he said.\n512 high schools and counting\nNEON’s model is not without hurdles. Celeste Pico, principal of Lompoc High School in California decided to introduce two NEON courses to increase college-prep offerings after the pandemic.\n“We’d be lying to you if we told you this has not taken a lot of time,” Pico said. “But we knew it was in the best interest of our students, because it’s more than having access to those classes — it’s helped close the gap for a lot of our students financially.”\nIncreasingly, NEON learners are entering college having finished one year of university-level courses, Pico said. In 2024-’25, Lompoc offered six NEON courses, eliminating several A.P. classes, in part because the A.P. grade is based on only one test.\nAdrienne Battle, superintendent of the Metro Nashville Public Schools in Tennessee, has also scaled up NEON courses in her district.\n“We’ve received quite a high positive-response rate and requests from not only our school teams but also from our students and parents,” she said, adding that she plans to expand NEON offerings in “all 12 of my zoned high schools.”\nClosing the confidence gap\nMarah Rigaud is a first-generation Haitian American who took five NEON courses at her high school in Long Island, N.Y., and now attends Yale.\n“Hearing these big names like Yale, Harvard, Georgetown can appear intimidating at first,” she said. “And when you don’t have that experience, you kind of feel a bit behind and thinking that college is some kind of impossible feat. These courses give you a foundation.”\nRigaud is one of the more than 10,000 students whose post-secondary outcomes NEON is tracking through a study by Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins. After five years of data analysis, Balfanz found that NEON students who pass a course are twice as likely to attend four-year colleges than students from similar high schools — and also persist in college at higher rates.\nCan the National Education Opportunity Network reach its goal of serving 1 million students within 10 years?\nCornfeld thinks so because demand for NEON courses is “higher than ever,” she said, with more than 35 new districts reaching out to join the network.\nMcCance, the Lab’s biggest individual funder, said, “I’ve never actually thought of whether the goal is precisely achievable or not,” but “one hurdle, quite frankly, is capital.”\n______\nTamara Straus is senior editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, where you can read the full article.

Viewing lasts until Nov. 7.\n“Weather permitting, it will be a great show,” LaCoursiere said.\nHalley’s comet passes near Earth every 75 years. Debris left by the comet leads to two major meteor showers every year.\n“Sometimes the Orionids leave trains, these bright lingering streak in the sky,” LaCoursiere said.\nHere’s what to know about the Orionids and other meteor showers.\nWhat is a meteor shower?\nAs the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets and sometimes asteroids. The source of the Orionids is debris from Halley’s comet.\nWhen these fast-moving space rocks enter Earth’s atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up.\nSometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail — the end of a “shooting star.”\nYou don’t need special equipment to see the meteor showers that flash across the sky annually, just a spot away from city lights.\nHow to view a meteor shower\nThe best time to watch a meteor shower is typically after midnight, or in the early pre-dawn hours, when there’s usually less interference from moonlight.\nCompeting sources of light — such as a bright moon or artificial glow from lights on the ground — are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest provide optimal viewing opportunities.\nAnd keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you aren’t checking your phone.\nWhen is the next meteor shower?\nThe next major meteor shower, the Southern Taurids, is expected to peak early Nov. 5, when the moon is full.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

    "body": "Ah, rats! Researchers say some other critter likely created Chicago’s ‘rat hole’ sidewalk landmark\nAh, rats!\nResearchers think they have debunked the origin of Chicago’s so-called “rat hole,” one of the Windy City’s weirdest local landmarks.\nHold on. The rat hole wasn’t what you think. It wasn’t some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city’s notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city’s Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.\nThe rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.\nThe constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.\nResearchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.\nThe researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.\nThe creature’s long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.\nOther researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn’t leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.\nThe imprint didn’t show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.\n“We therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the ‘Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel’ — a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,” they wrote.",

Plus, many in the neighborhood argue that the imprint was actually caused by a squirrel.\nAP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on the removal of some cement in Chicago.\nErica Schroeder, a spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Transportation, said the square of sidewalk “containing the famous ‘Chicago rat hole’” is now in temporary storage.\nShe said that where the slab of sidewalk, which has an impression resembling the outline of a rat — claws, tail and all — will eventually end up is expected to be a “collaborative decision between the city departments and the mayor’s office.”\nSchroeder said the rat hole section, as well as other portions of sidewalk along Roscoe Street, were removed by Department of Transportation crews Wednesday morning after the agency inspected them and determined they needed to be replaced because of damage.\nGeorgina Ulrich, a neighbor, shot video of crews using a concrete saw, a forklift and finally a truck to remove the slab and drive it away.\n“All this for a rat imprint,” Ulrich said in one of the clips.\nNew concrete was poured later Wednesday, Schroeder said.\n“The alderman’s office has definitely received complaints from neighbors about people gathering and people placing a bunch of different objects in the public way there,” she told The Associated Press.\nAlderman Scott Waguespack’s office had been receiving complaints for several months, both about that portion of sidewalk being uneven and people congregating there to look at and photograph the rat hole, Paul Sajovec, Waguespack’s chief of staff, said Wednesday.\n“It was just a combination of the fact that the sidewalk was uneven and also that people would show up at various times of the day and night and make a lot of noise and create other issues and problems,” he said.\nIn January, someone filled in the rat hole with a material resembling white plaster, although the impression was quickly dug out by fans, the Chicago Tribune reported at the time.\nChicago resident Winslow Dumaine told the newspaper that people living nearby said the imprint had been there for nearly two decades.\n___\nCallahan reported from Indianapolis.",

The “expert judge” was Sasha Suda, chief executive of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\nMoser described his work as “Caravaggio meets Siriani” — Nick Siriani is the Eagles’ head coach, and Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio was a Baroque painter in Italy during the 14th and 15th centuries. The tush push, also sometimes called the “brotherly shove,” is a play by the reigning NFL champions that other teams have been unable to counter.\nAs for scrapple? Although it’s sometimes the butt of jokes, it’s a food that’s popular among the German families who settled in eastern Pennsylvania in the colonial period. When made properly it’s a porcine delicacy and commonly available at diners and on farmhouse tables across the state.\nIt takes hours to properly cook, according to Marlin Dietrich, owner of Dietrich’s Meats & Country Store in Krumsville, Pennsylvania. He sells about 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of it per week.\nDietrich boils down beef and pork bones and seasons it all with salt, pepper and coriander. His scrapple is thickened with buckwheat flour and roasted cornmeal. Dietrich fries it to a crisp exterior and enjoys it with another Pennsylvania Dutch staple, apple butter.\n“I like it once or twice a week for breakfast,” Dietrich said. “Making a sculpture? That’s a shame.”\nMoser’s lumps of indistinguishable football players won him a trophy and a $100 gift card. The public is also getting a chance to weigh in on Saturday, when the artworks were to be on display at the market. Last year’s scrapple sculpting contest winner was a cookie jar decorated with a rooster and an egg inside.\nIf a football themed sculpture isn’t enough scrapple, the festival also features such culinary offerings such as scrapple fries, an andouille scrapple breakfast sandwich, scrapple apple cookies and scrapple quiche. There’s even a scrapple cheesesteak.\n___\nScolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

(AP) — Nestled in forests around the world, a gentle army of giant wooden trolls want to show humans how to live better without destroying the planet.\nThe Danish recycle artist Thomas Dambo and his team have created 170 troll sculptures from discarded materials such as wooden pallets, old furniture and wine barrels.\nTwelve years after he started the “Trail of a Thousand Trolls” project, his sculptures can be found in more than 20 countries and 21 U.S. states. Each year Dambo and his team make about 25 new trolls, which stand up to 40 feet (12 meters) tall.\n“I believe that we can make anything out of anything,” said Dambo, speaking from his farm outside Copenhagen. “We are drowning in trash. But we also know that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.”\nAn installation of six sculptures called “Trolls Save the Humans” is on display at Filoli, a historic estate with 650 acres of forests and gardens in Woodside, California, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of San Francisco.\n“They bring us back to be connected to the earth and to nature,” said Jeannette Weederman, who was visiting Filoli with her son in July.\nDambo’s trolls each have their own personality and story. At Filoli, the troll Ibbi Pip builds birdhouses, Rosa Sunfinger plants flowers and Kamma Can makes jewelry from people’s garbage.\n“Each of them has a story to tell,” said Filoli CEO Kara Newport. “It inspires people to think of their own stories, what kind of creatures might live in their woods and make that connection to living beings in nature.”\nDambo’s trolls don’t like humans because they waste nature’s resources and pollute the planet. The mythical creatures have a long-term perspective because they live for thousands of years and have witnessed the destructive force of human civilizations.\nBut the six young trolls at Filoli have a more optimistic view of human nature. They believe they can teach people how to protect the environment.\n“They want to save the humans. So they do this by teaching them how to be better humans — be humans that don’t destroy nature,” said Dambo, 45, a poet and former hip-hop artist. “They hope to save them from being eaten by the older trolls.”\nDambo’s trolls are hidden in forests, mountains, jungles and grasslands throughout Europe and North America as well as countries such as Australia, Chile and South Korea. Most were built with local materials and assembled on-site by his team of craftsmen and artists with help from local volunteers.\n“My exhibition now has four and a half million visitors a year globally, and it’s all made out of trash together with volunteers,” said Dambo. “That is such a huge proof of concept of why we should not throw things out, but why we should recycle it.”",

(AP) — The Richardson’s ground squirrel weighs less than a pound, is about a foot long and is native to the northern Plains.\nThe little creature also is a ferocious tunneler, and it’s exasperating the people of Minot, North Dakota, where it’s burrowing everywhere from vacant lots to the middle of town, and growing more plentiful over the past two decades.\nNow North Dakota’s fourth-largest city is fighting back, but even the pest control guy leading the charge acknowledges that it will be difficult to turn the tide against the rodent.\nAn uphill battle\nJoshua Herman said fighting the squirrels is akin to “one guy standing against a massive storm.”\n“If I’m trapping but my neighbor isn’t, well then, we’re really not going to get anywhere with it, long-term,” Herman said.\nGround squirrels have been an issue in Minot, a city of nearly 50,000 people, for at least 20 years, but the problem has dramatically worsened in the last few years, said Minot Street Department Superintendent Kevin Braaten.\nIt’s unclear how many of the squirrels live in Minot but it likely nears or even exceeds the city’s population.\n“Gosh, there’s got to be tens of thousands of them in the area,” Herman said.\nOfficials in the city, a green spot along the winding Souris River surrounded by farmland and grassy prairie, know they can’t get rid of the squirrels, but hope to simply get the rodent numbers down.\n“I don’t see the population ever going to zero,” Braaten said. “I mean, it’s almost impossible by the numbers that we have.”\nPut another way, Minot won’t be able to rid itself of the squirrels because the animals have lived on the prairie for centuries. Outside of town, predators like coyotes, badgers, owls and even snakes love to dine on the squirrels. But in residential neighborhoods and even downtown, where few of their predators live, the rodents can roam pretty freely.\nGreg Gullickson, an outreach biologist with the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, adds that the squirrels now have fewer grassland areas available to them and like the mowed spots they find in town.\nNo land is safe\nFemale squirrels typically give birth to litters of about six babies a year, so it’s easy to see how their numbers can quickly soar.\nHerman said he kills 3,500 to 5,000 of them a year, primarily by putting snares and carbon monoxide into the holes, and using an air rifle.\n“I’ve had calls downtown, calls in the mall, along the highways, here at the airport — really every part of the city I’ve done trapping for ground squirrels here in Minot,” Herman said as he checked his traps along an apartment building and shoveled dirt over holes.\nHerman says they damage driveways, sidewalks and lawns; create tripping hazards with their holes and can harbor disease from fleas.\nAlong an apartment building, the squirrels had dug under a concrete slab and against the foundation. Nearby in a vacant lot, the rodents popped in and out of holes.\nGround squirrels near Pashone Grandson’s ground-level apartment dig holes near her door and eat her plants. One squirrel even got around her baby gate at the door and into her daughter’s clothes in her bedroom.\n“It was a little scary. You don’t know what disease they carry. They’re dirty. I have a young daughter ... I didn’t know if it was going to bite her,” Grandson said.\nNorth of town, Minot Air Force Base, which houses bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, has fought the ground squirrels for years. Earlier this month, the base said it had trapped more than 800 “dak-rats,” a base name for the rodents.\nBase officials declined to comment on the squirrels.\nJared Edwards, facilities director for Minot Public Schools, which has three schools on the base, said residential areas of the base and runways are overrun by ground squirrels. He called it “a continuous battle for them for the last 75 years since the base has been there.”\n“I’m not going to exaggerate: They’re by the millions out there,” Edwards said.\nIn town, three school properties have large populations of ground squirrels, he said. Last year, the school system began using snares, and for years before that had used poison.\n“It’s something you have to keep up with. It is Mother Nature,” Edwards said, adding that they’ve probably been in the area since homesteaders came through.\nA cute nuisance\nStill, not everyone sees the squirrels as a pest. Some find the critters cute and fuzzy.\nHerman said people have sabotaged, stolen or thrown out his traps. They occasionally confront him when he shoots at ground squirrels with an air rifle, scolding him for hurting the wildlife, he said.\n“They get that cute association, and they are, you know, adorable, but they’re a vermin and a pest and dangerous when they are allowed to proliferate,” Herman said.",

    "body": "Walking is good for you. Walking backward can add to the benefits\nHere’s a simple way to switch up your walking routine, according to experts: try going backward.\nTaking a brisk walk is an exercise rich in simplicity, and it can have impressive mental and physical benefits: stronger bones and muscles, cardiovascular fitness and stress relief, to name a few. But like any workout, hoofing it for your health may feel repetitive and even boring after a while.\nBackward walking, also known as retro walking or reverse walking, could add variety and value to an exercise routine, when done safely. Turning around not only provides a change of view, but also puts different demands on your body.\nJanet Dufek, a biomechanist and faculty member at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has researched the mechanics of both walking and landing from jumps to identify ways of preventing injuries and improving physical performance. And as a former college basketball player and a regular exerciser, she’s also done her fair share of backward walking.\nIn humans, reverse locomotion can increase hamstring flexibility, strengthen underused muscles and challenges the mind as the body adjusts to a new movement and posture.\n“I see a lot of people in my neighborhood and they walk, and that’s good,” she said. “But they are still stressing the same elements of their structure over and over again. Walking backward introduces an element of cross-training, a subtly different activity.”\nOn the treadmill\nKevin Patterson, a personal trainer in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends the treadmill as the safest place to retro walk. You can adjust it to a slow speed. However, Patterson likes to turn off the treadmill — termed the “dead mill” — and have clients propel the belt on their own.\n“It can take a while to get the treadmill going, but from there we have them be the horsepower for the treadmill,” he said.\nPatterson said he uses backward walking with all his clients as an “accessory exercise” — a weight-training term for add-on movements designed to work a specific muscle group — or during warm-ups. The activity typically makes up a small part of the workouts, he said.\n“The treadmill is great for older clients because you have the handles on the side and you reduce that risk of falling,” he said.\nOff the treadmill\nDufek suggests working a one-minute segment of backward walking into a 10-minute walk and adding time and distance as you get comfortable.\nYou can also do it with a partner; face each other, perhaps clasp hands. One person walks backward, and the other strolls forward and watches for problems. Then switch positions.\n“At first, you start really, really slowly because there’s a balance accommodation and there is brain retraining. You are learning a new skill,” Dufek said. “You’re using muscles in different ways.”\nIf you work your way up to running and get really good at it, you can try running a marathon backward — 26.2 miles or 42.2 kilometers. Yes, people have done that.\nBackward walking as cross-training\nDufek classifies backward walking as a form of cross-training, or incorporating a mix of moves into a fitness program. Doing a range of exercises can help prevent overuse injuries, which can occur after repeatedly using the same muscle groups.\nFor many people, cross-training involves different activities and types of exercise: for example, running one day, swimming the next, and strength training on a third day. But the modifications required to walk backward work in the same way, but on a micro level.\nDo small tweaks make much of a difference? Once an avid runner, Dufek said she had several pairs of running shoes and did not wear the same pair two days in a row.\n“The shoes had a different level of wear, a different design,” she said. “Just by changing that one element, in this case footwear, it would provide a slightly different stress to the system.”\nRetro walking as rehabilitation\nPhysical therapists instruct some of their clients to reverse walk, which can be useful after knee injuries or for people in rehabilitation or recovering from surgery.\n“Backward walking is very different than forward walking from a force perspective, from a movement pattern perspective,” Dufek explained. Instead of landing heel first, “you strike the forefoot first, often quite gently, and often the heel does not contact the ground.”\n“This reduces of the range of motion in the knee joint, which allows for activity without stressing the (knee) joint,” Dufek said.\nBackward walking also stretches the hamstring muscles, the group of muscles at the back of the thigh. Dufek is interested in finding out if it improves balance and reduces fall risks in older adults by activating more senses of the body.\nAthletes do it naturally\nThere is nothing unnatural about backward walking. In fact, backward running is a key skill for top athletes.\nBasketball players do it. So do soccer players. American football players — particularly the defensive backs — do it continually.\n“I played basketball and I probably spent 40% of my time playing defense and running backwards,” Dufek said.\n___\nFollow AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on all aspects of wellness, at https://apnews.com/hub/be-well",

    "body": "Is spending all day on your feet at work an occupational hazard?\nNEW YORK (AP) — As a citizen of both France and America, Margaux Lantelme has noticed a difference in how store cashiers work in the two countries: in France, they do their jobs sitting down. In the U.S., where Lantelme works a register at REI, cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.\nFor Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She’s still waiting for final approval.\n“Not having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,” Lantelme said. “I personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.”\nAches, pains and complications\nStanding for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.\nBeing on one’s feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.\nThe association recommends trying “fatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,” said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.\nThe right to sit down\nMany jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.\nCecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. “It takes a really hard toll on the knees,” she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn’t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.\nShe said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she’d been on her feet for five hours without a break.\nOrtiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.\n“It’s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn’t be a problem,” Ortiz said.\nHer former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. “Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,” company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. “This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.”\nUnionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan’s Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.\n“The longer I’ve been at the job, I’ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we’re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,” bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. “Being able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I’m doing things on the computer while I’m at the registers.”\nSpiegel’s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it’s hard for him to predict what days he’ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.\n“There have been days that I’ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,” Spiegel said.\nBarnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it’s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller’s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.\nThe Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union’s president.\nDuring one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. “The employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,” Appelbaum said. “I think the point was made.”\nIn the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.\nSitting once was a protected right\nAround the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nWomen were seen as the “mothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,” Boris added. “Almost every state had laws, but they weren’t enforced.”\nThose laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women’s movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.\nLabor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. “The English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,” Boris said.\nIn 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.\nToday, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with “right to sit” laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nThe city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn’t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.\n___\nHave you overcome an obstacle or made a profound change in your work? Send your questions and story ideas to [email protected].

    "body": "Prescription drug coverage options are shrinking for Medicare shoppers\nFewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall.\nThe number of available, stand-alone drug plans has fallen for a few years, and that trend will continue for 2026. Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.\nShoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.\nSome things to consider:\nHere’s who needs a Medicare Part D plan\nRegular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.\nAbout 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.\nAnother roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.\nHow Medicare Part D plans are changing\nA typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That’s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.\nShoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund’s Gretchen Jacobson.\nDepending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.\nSome insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.\nThere are still many Medicare Part D options\nMost markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don’t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.\n“I think there’s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they’re going to end up worse off,” Cubanski said.\nMore people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nBefore 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.\nHere’s how Medicare Part D prices are changing\nMonthly premiums, or coverage prices, will fall nearly 10% on average to $34.50, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced last month.\nAt least one option with a premium of under $20 exists in almost every region of the country, according to the consulting firm Oliver Wyman.\nIndividual prices will range widely, with premiums for the same plan varying by state, Cubanski noted.\nBut while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.\nInsurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.\nWhere to get help shopping for Medicare Part D plans\nShoppers can use a federal government website to compare plan prices and coverage.\nStates also have a State Health Insurance Program created specifically to help people on Medicare find coverage.\nConsumers can help themselves by checking their coverage for changes and comparing it with other plans.\nShoppers also should consider whether their pharmacy is in the network covered by any plan they are considering, said Jacobson, Commonwealth’s vice president of Medicare.\nSome might also consider switching to Medicare Advantage plans with prescription coverage. But those plans can have more limited networks of covered doctors, which can pose a problem for people with fewer care choices in rural areas.\nWhy delaying may not be wise\nThe enrollment window spans several weeks, but brokers say many people wait until that first week in December to make decisions, often after talking with family during holiday dinners.\nThat can create a deadline crunch that makes it harder to find help in early December.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "A good shower is a simple shower, no matter what influencers recommend\nYou may be seeing elaborate shower cleansing routines on social media: daily exfoliation, double cleansing, antibacterial soap, loads of scented body scrubs and shower oils.\n“I’m kind of appalled by the shower routines,” said Dr. Olga Bunimovich, a practicing dermatologist and assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.\nThe multistep processes that have inspired people to spend endless amounts of time sudsing up can harm your skin — and the environment. Dermatologists say it’s all mostly unnecessary.\n“Your skin is a barrier,” said Dr. Nicole Negbenebor, a dermatologic surgeon at University of Iowa Health Care. “It’s one of the biggest barriers you have. It’s you in your natural elements. So you want to treat it right, and then sometimes there can be too much of a good thing.”\nAP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on why long showers aren’t necessary.\nHere’s what to know about how to take a basic shower and indicators that you’ve gone too far with your routine.\nThe basics of showering\nA shower is a relatively simple routine that usually doesn’t require 10 steps or a plethora of products.\nA daily shower with lukewarm water and a fragrance-free hypoallergenic cleanser — followed by hydrating lotion or oil afterward — will do the trick.\nDon’t plan to stay in the shower too long or turn the water temperature too high — it can strip your skin of the natural oils it needs to maintain its barrier, leaving it vulnerable to dryness and irritation.\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\nWhen it comes to soaps, use one meant for sensitive skin. Antibacterial soaps are popular, but experts said they dry out your skin too much for daily use. (However, they can be beneficial for people with an autoimmune skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa, which causes painful boils and abscesses on the skin.)\nOils can be beneficial for your skin once you’re damp and out of the shower, Negbenebor said. But it’s important to remember that oil isn’t a moisturizer, but a sealant. The water hydrates your skin, but the oil will lock in that moisture.\n“It’s nice to hear about skincare routines that do involve both cleansing and also providing hydration,” Dr. Lisa Akintilo, a dermatologist at NYU Langone Health, “because that’s missing in a lot of people’s skin care routine.”\n“Double cleansing” is unnecessary\nSome influencers suggest that a skin care routine isn’t complete without exfoliation and what’s called double cleansing.\nThe latter is typically reserved for facial skincare routines, especially when you’re wearing makeup, and involves using an oil-based cleanser to break down makeup and excess oil followed by a water-based cleanser to remove any remaining residue.\nExperts said you don’t need to bring that practice to the full body.\n“Not only do I not think that we need to double cleanse our skin … people overuse soap all the time,” Bunimovich said. “You should not be soaping up all of your skin, period.” Instead, Bunimovich added, wash your privates and your skin folds.\nExfoliate — but not too much\nExfoliation is meant to remove dead skin cells off our body, and is good for our skin, experts said. But doing it daily could cause a mound of problems, especially if you have dry skin or skin conditions like eczema or acne.\nManual exfoliation — that is when you use a body scrub or a rougher loofah — should be done sparingly to avoid irritation.\nIf you see rashes on your skin after exfoliation, it may be a sign you’re over doing it.\nA more gentle way of exfoliating is using products that have lactic or glycolic acid, dermatologists said, but not all the time.\nSave water, shorten your shower\nShowers account for nearly 17% of Americans’ indoor water use, the Environmental Protection Agency says.\nMultiple states in moderate to severe drought conditions have called for water conservation efforts this year — including taking shorter showers.\nIf you want to get clean and retain your natural oils, a lukewarm shower that gives you enough time to clean your body should do the trick in most cases.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "A new cookbook ties healthy eating to good sleep\nA new cookbook ties healthy eating to good sleep\nAnyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.\nFor Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University’s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.\nData from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don’t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.\n“It’s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,” St-Onge said.\nIf bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, “Eat Better, Sleep Better,” co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.\nSt-Onge said the answer is yes. The book’s recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.\nNuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\nBesides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.\nSt-Onge noted that people shouldn’t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.\n“It’s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,” she said.\nRecipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.\nCraddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.\n“My instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,” Craddock said.\nInstead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. “It was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.”\nA Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used — a pork product high in saturated fat — is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.\nWith numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.\n“If you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,” she said.\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Albert Stumm writes about food, travel and wellness.

    "body": "Some people tape their mouths shut at night. Doctors wish they wouldn’t\nHaving your mouth taped shut is the stuff of nightmares — but some people are doing just that to themselves. And in an attempt to sleep better, no less.\nDoctors say don’t do it.\nSome on social media say it’s a hack for getting more and better sleep and to reduce snoring. The claims — which are not backed by science — are taking off on places like TikTok, sometimes pushed by people working for companies selling related products.\n“The studies behind mouth tape are small, the benefits are modest and the potential risks are there,” said Dr. Kimberly Hutchison, a neurologist and sleep medicine expert at Oregon Health & Science University. Some of those risks include making sleep disorders like sleep apnea worse, or even causing suffocation.\nIt is better to breathe through your nose most of the time\nMouth breathing in adults is not a major health problem, but it is better to breath through your nose, experts say. Your nose is a natural filtering system, trapping dust and other allergens before they can get to your lungs.\nIf you’re breathing with your mouth open at night, you could wake up with a dry mouth and irritated throat, which can contribute to bad breath and oral health problems. Mouth breathing is also associated with more snoring.\nDon’t rush to use mouth tape\nBut even though breathing through your nose is better than breathing through your mouth, taping your mouth shut isn’t the best way to fix the issue.\nThere’s no strong evidence it helps improve sleep. A few studies have been conducted, most of which showed little or no impact, but they were so small experts say conclusions should not be drawn from them.\nAnd meanwhile, there are the potential dangers to be avoided.\nDr. David Schulman, a sleep doctor at Emory University, said there are other things to try, like prescription mouth pieces that can open up your airway, or a CPAP machine. If you’re a smoker or are overweight, for example, quitting smoking and losing weight can help.\nMouth breathing could be a sign of something serious — so find out\nThe safest approach is to figure out why exactly you are breathing with your mouth, because there could be something else going on.\nYou may be breathing through your mouth because you have obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep because of a blocked airway. The disorder is linked to both open mouth breathing and snoring, and is typically treated with a CPAP machine.\n“The reason sleep apnea can be bad is that any decrease in the quality of sleep can affect you day to day or over the course of your life,” said Dr. Brian Chen, a sleep doctor at the Cleveland Clinic. “Depending on how bad the sleep is, you may just feel sleep deprived or require more sleep.”\nThe best thing to do, Emory’s Shulman says, is get a sleep test, some of which can be done at home. “It’s always better to know than not know,” he said. “And if you know that something’s going on and you choose not to pursue therapy, at least you know you’re making an educated decision.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Democrats are becoming a force in traditionally conservative The Villages\nTHE VILLAGES, Fla. (AP) — The Villages, one of the world’s largest retirement communities, has long been known as a conservative stronghold. In the past, left-leaning residents of the central Florida enclave tended to keep their views to themselves, fearing they might be kicked out of their golf group, excluded from the mahjong club, or disinvited from a neighborhood pool party.\nBut Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate has given the small, but enthusiastic group a boost of confidence and a push into the light.\n“They are beginning to realize that they have a voice and they can use it,” said Diane Foley, president of the Villages Democratic Club, which has seen its membership nearly double since the 2020 election cycle, to around 1,500 people.\nPrior to that time, she noted, “Democrats have been inclined to be quiet and to not broadcast their political preferences because we were so overwhelmed by the Republican party.”\nParades of golf carts decorated in support of Harris have rolled through the streets, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff recently paid a visit. Meanwhile, Democrats opting to wear a T-shirt or put up a lawn sign in favor of Harris have had neighbors approach them with relief, saying, “We thought we were the only ones.”\nStill, most say they choose not to talk politics openly, to avoid tension in Wildwood-The Villages, the official name of this census-designated, master-planned metro area of more than 151,000 people.\n“You want to get along with your neighbors. They’re nice people. So we just don’t talk about it,” says Foley.\nRetired lawyer Howard Underwood, 71, and his wife, Janet, 74, were Republicans for four decades until Donald Trump became the candidate in 2016.\n“We’ve made common cause with the Democrats, even though I don’t share a whole lot of Kamala’s ideas on things,” says Underwood, who is now not affiliated with either major party but has volunteered with the Democrats club to support Harris.\nUnderwood won’t go so far as to put a bumper sticker on his car for fear of blowback, but he acknowledges that the political atmosphere is changing, however slightly.\n“Democrats in The Villages has kind of become a thing,” he said with a laugh.\nMost of our best friends are conservative. We know they are red, and they know we are blue, and we all just don’t talk about it.”\nWe’re all here for one reason, we’re retired. We’re relaxing… trying to.”\nWe’ve made common cause with the Democrats even though I don’t share a whole lot of Kamala’s ideas on things... The alternative is unthinkable.”\nWhen we moved here, we were more concerned about being Democrat than being Jewish,”\nDon’t whisper. Democrats can be loud and proud too.”\nThere was no effort until Harris came on... It was general depression. No one wanted to get involved.”\nWe have gotten death threats about who we are going to vote for,”",

    "body": "‘Why? Why? Why?’ Ukraine’s Mariupol descends into despair\n‘Why? Why? Why?’ Ukraine’s Mariupol descends into despair\nMARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — The bodies of the children all lie here, dumped into this narrow trench hastily dug into the frozen earth of Mariupol to the constant drumbeat of shelling.\nThere’s 18-month-old Kirill, whose shrapnel wound to the head proved too much for his little toddler’s body. There’s 16-year-old Iliya, whose legs were blown up in an explosion during a soccer game at a school field. There’s the girl no older than 6 who wore the pajamas with cartoon unicorns, among the first of Mariupol’s children to die from a Russian shell.\nThey are stacked together with dozens of others in this mass grave on the outskirts of the city. A man covered in a bright blue tarp, weighed down by stones at the crumbling curb. A woman wrapped in a red and gold bedsheet, her legs neatly bound at the ankles with a scrap of white fabric. Workers toss the bodies in as fast as they can, because the less time they spend in the open, the better their own chances of survival.\n“The only thing (I want) is for this to be finished,” raged worker Volodymyr Bykovskyi, pulling crinkling black body bags from a truck. “Damn them all, those people who started this!”\nMore bodies will come, from streets where they are everywhere and from the hospital basement where adults and children are laid out awaiting someone to pick them up. The youngest still has an umbilical stump attached.\nEach airstrike and shell that relentlessly pounds Mariupol — about one a minute at times — drives home the curse of a geography that has put the city squarely in the path of Russia’s domination of Ukraine. This southern seaport of 430,000 has become a symbol of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s drive to crush democratic Ukraine — but also of a fierce resistance on the ground.\nIn the nearly three weeks since Russia’s war began, two Associated Press journalists have been the only international media present in Mariupol, chronicling its fall into chaos and despair. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time.\nSeveral appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that about 30,000 people had fled in convoys of cars. Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go.\nThe surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water.\nPeople burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings.\nDeath is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can’t be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it’s too dangerous to hold funerals.\nMany of the deaths documented by the AP were of children and mothers, despite Russia’s claims that civilians haven’t been attacked.\n“They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 10.\nJust weeks ago, Mariupol’s future seemed much brighter.\nIf geography drives a city’s destiny, Mariupol was on the path to success, with its thriving iron and steel plants, a deep-water port and high global demand for both. Even the dark weeks of 2014, when the city nearly fell to Russia-backed separatists in vicious street battles, were fading into memory.\nAnd so the first few days of the invasion had a perverse familiarity for many residents. About 100,000 people left at that time while they still could, according to Serhiy Orlov, the deputy mayor. But most stayed put, figuring they could wait out whatever came next or eventually make their way west like so many others.\n“I felt more fear in 2014, I don’t feel the same panic now,” Anna Efimova said as she shopped for supplies at a market on Feb. 24. “There is no panic. There’s nowhere to run, where can we run?”\nThat same day, a Ukrainian military radar and airfield were among the first targets of Russian artillery. Shelling and airstrikes could and did come at any moment, and people spent most of their time in shelters. Life was hardly normal, but it was livable.\nBy Feb. 27, that started to change, as an ambulance raced into a city hospital carrying a small motionless girl, not yet 6. Her brown hair was pulled back off her pale face with a rubber band, and her pajama pants were bloodied by Russian shelling.\nHer wounded father came with her, his head bandaged. Her mother stood outside the ambulance, weeping.\nAs the doctors and nurses huddled around her, one gave her an injection. Another shocked her with a defibrillator. A doctor in blue scrubs, pumping oxygen into her, looked straight into the camera of an AP journalist allowed inside and cursed.\n“Show this to Putin,” he stormed with expletive-laced fury. “The eyes of this child and crying doctors.”\nThey couldn’t save her. Doctors covered the tiny body with her pink striped jacket and gently closed her eyes. She now rests in the mass grave.\nThe same geography that for so long worked in Mariupol’s favor had turned against it. The city stands squarely between regions controlled by the Russia-backed separatists — about 10 kilometers (six miles) to the east at the closest point — and the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. The capture of Mariupol would give the Russians a clear land corridor all the way through, controlling the Sea of Azov.\nAs February ended, the siege began. Ignoring the danger, or restless, or perhaps just feeling invincible as teenagers do, a group of boys met up a few days later, on March 2, to play soccer on a pitch outside a school.\nA bomb exploded. The blast tore through Iliya’s legs.\nThe odds were against him, and increasingly against the city. The electricity went out yet again, as did most mobile networks. Without communications, medics had to guess which hospitals could still handle the wounded and which roads could still be navigated to reach them.\nIliya couldn’t be saved. His father, Serhii, dropped down, hugged his dead boy’s head and wailed out his grief.\nOn March 4, it was yet another child in the emergency room — Kirill, the toddler struck in the head by shrapnel. His mother and stepfather bundled him in a blanket. They hoped for the best, and then endured the worst.\n“Why? Why? Why?” his sobbing mother, Marina Yatsko, asked in the hospital hallway, as medical workers looked on helplessly. She tenderly unwrapped the blanket around her lifeless child to kiss him and inhale his scent one last time, her dark hair falling over him.\nThat was the day the darkness settled in for good — a blackout in both power and knowledge. Ukrainian television and radio were cut, and car stereos became the only link to the outside world. They played Russian news, describing a world that couldn’t be further from the reality in Mariupol.\nAs it sunk in that there was truly no escape, the mood of the city changed. It didn’t take long for grocery store shelves to empty. Mariupol’s residents cowered by night in underground shelters and emerged by day to grab what they could before scurrying underground again.\nOn March 6, in the way of desperate people everywhere, they turned on each other. On one street lined with darkened stores, people smashed windows, pried open metal shutters, grabbed what they could.\nA man who had broken into a store found himself face to face with the furious shopkeeper, caught red-handed with a child’s rubber ball.\n“You bastard, you stole that ball now. Put the ball back. Why did you even come here?” she demanded. Shame written on his face, he tossed the ball into a corner and fled.\nNearby, a soldier emerged from another looted store, on the verge of tears.\n“People, please be united. ... This is your home. Why are you smashing windows, why are you stealing from your shops?” he pleaded, his voice breaking.\nYet another attempt to negotiate an evacuation failed. A crowd formed at one of the roads leading away from the city, but a police officer blocked their path.\n“Everything is mined, the ways out of town are being shelled,” he told them. “Trust me, I have family at home, and I am also worried about them. Unfortunately, the maximum security for all of us is to be inside the city, underground and in the shelters.”\nAnd that’s where Goma Janna could be found that night, weeping beside an oil lamp that threw light but not enough heat to take the chill off the basement room. She wore a scarf and a cheery turquoise snowflake sweater as she roughly rubbed the tears from her face, one side at a time. Behind her, beyond the small halo of light, a small group of women and children crouched in the darkness, trembling at the explosions above.\n“I want my home, I want my job. I’m so sad about people and about the city, the children,” she sobbed.\nThis agony fits in with Putin’s goals. The siege is a military tactic popularized in medieval times and designed to crush a population through starvation and violence, allowing an attacking force to spare its own soldiers the cost of entering a hostile city. Instead, civilians are the ones left to die, slowly and painfully.\nPutin has refined the tactic during his years in power, first in the Chechen city of Grozny in 2000 and then in the Syrian city of Aleppo in 2016. He reduced both to ruins.\n“It epitomizes Russian warfare, what we see now in terms of the siege,” said Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher for Chatham House’s Russia program.\nBy March 9, the sound of Russian fighter jets in Mariupol was enough to send people screaming for cover — anything to avoid the airstrikes they knew would follow, even if they didn’t know where.\nThe jets rumbled across the sky, this time decimating the maternity hospital. They left a crater two stories deep in the courtyard.\nRescuers rushed a pregnant woman through the rubble and light snow as she stroked her bloodied belly, face blanched and head lolling listlessly to the side. Her baby was dying inside her, and she knew it, medics said.\n“Kill me now!” she screamed, as they struggled to save her life at another hospital even closer to the front line.\nThe baby was born dead. A half-hour later, the mother died too. The doctors had no time to learn either of their names.\nAnother pregnant woman, Mariana Vishegirskaya, was waiting to give birth at the maternity hospital when the strike hit. Her brow and cheek bloodied, she clutched her belongings in a plastic bag and navigated the debris-strewn stairs in polka-dot pajamas. Outside the ruined hospital, she stared motionless with wide blue eyes at the crackling flames.\nVishegirskaya delivered her child the next day to the sound of shellfire. Baby Veronika drew her first breath on March 10.\nThe two women — one dead and one a mother — have since become the symbol of their blackened, burning hometown. Facing worldwide condemnation, Russian officials claimed that the maternity hospital had been taken over by far-right Ukrainian forces to use as a base and emptied of patients and nurses.\nIn two tweets, the Russian Embassy in London posted side-by-side images of AP photos with the word “FAKE” over them in red text. They claimed that the maternity hospital had long been out of operation, and that Vishegirskaya was an actress playing a role. Twitter has since removed the tweets, saying they violated its rules.\nThe AP reporters in Mariupol who documented the attack in video and photos saw nothing to indicate the hospital was used as anything other than a hospital. There is also nothing to suggest Vishegirskaya, a Ukrainian beauty blogger from Mariupol, was anything but a patient. Veronika’s birth attests to the pregnancy that her mother carefully documented on Instagram, including one post in which she is wearing the polka-dot pajamas.\nTwo days after Veronika was born, four Russian tanks emblazoned with the letter Z took up position near the hospital where she and her mother were recovering. An AP journalist was among a group of medical workers who came under sniper fire, with one hit in the hip.\nThe windows rattled, and the hallways were lined with people with nowhere else to go. Anastasia Erashova wept and trembled as she held a sleeping child. Shelling had just killed her other child as well as her brother’s child, and Erashova’s scalp was encrusted with blood.\n“I don’t know where to run to,” she cried out, her anguish growing with every sob. “Who will bring back our children? Who?”\nBy early this week, Russian forces had seized control of the building entirely, trapping medics and patients inside and using it as a base, according to a doctor there and local officials.\nOrlov, the deputy mayor, predicted worse is soon to come. Most of the city remains trapped.\n“Our defenders will defend to the last bullet,” he said. “But people are dying without water and food, and I think in the next several days we will count hundreds and thousands of deaths.”\n___\nHinnant reported from Paris.

    "body": "Alaska airlifting hundreds from storm-devastated coastal villages\nAlaska airlifting hundreds from storm-devastated coastal villages\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — One of the most significant airlifts in Alaska history was underway Wednesday to move hundreds of people from coastal villages ravaged by high surf and strong winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong last weekend, officials said.\nThe storm brought record water levels to two low-lying communities and washed away homes — some with people inside. At least one person was killed and two are missing. Makeshift shelters were quickly established and swelled to about 1,500 people, an extraordinary number in a sparsely populated region where communities are reachable by air or water.\nThe remoteness and the scale of the destruction created challenges for getting resources in place. Damage assessments have been trickling in as responders have shifted from initial search-and-rescue operations to trying to stabilize or restore basic services.\nThe communities of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok near the Bering Sea saw water levels more than 6 feet (1.8 meters) above the highest normal tide line. Leaders asked the state to evacuate the more than 1,000 residents in those villages, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state emergency management office.\nSome homes cannot be reoccupied, even with emergency repairs, and others may not be livable by winter, said emergency management officials. Forecasters say rain and snow is possible in the region this weekend, with average temperatures soon below freezing.\nMark Roberts, the incident commander with the state emergency management agency, said the immediate focus was on “making sure people are safe, warm and cared for while we work with our partners to restore essential services.”\nMeantime, restrooms were again working at the school in Kwigillingok, where about 350 people had sheltered overnight Tuesday, according to a state emergency management statement. “Damage to many homes is severe, and the community leadership is instructing residents not to reenter homes due to safety concerns,” it said.\nAbout 300 evacuees were being brought to Anchorage on Wednesday, about 500 miles (805 kilometers) east of the battered coastline villages, according to the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. They were going to the Alaska Airlines Center, a sports and events complex with capacity for about 400, Zidek said.\nShelter space closer to home — in the southwest Alaska regional hub of Bethel — had been reaching capacity, officials said.\nZidek did not know how long the evacuation process would take and said authorities were looking for additional sheltering locations. The aim is to get people from congregate shelters into hotel rooms or dormitories, he said.\nThe crisis unfolding in southwest Alaska has drawn attention to Trump administration cuts to grants aimed at helping small, mostly Indigenous villages prepare for storms or mitigate disaster risks.\nFor example, a $20 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant to Kipnuk, which was inundated by floodwaters, was terminated by the Trump administration, a move challenged by environmental groups. The grant was intended to protect to protect the boardwalk residents use to get around the community as well as 1,400 feet (430 meters) of river from erosion, according to a federal website that tracks government spending.\nThere was limited work on the project before the grant was ended. The village had purchased a bulldozer for shipment and briefly hired a bookkeeper, according to Public Rights Project, which represents Kipnuk.\nThe group said no single project was likely to prevent the recent flood. But work to remove abandoned fuel tanks and other material to prevent it from falling into the river might have been feasible during the 2025 construction season.\n“What’s happening in Kipnuk shows the real cost of pulling back support that was already promised to front line communities,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project. “These grants were designed to help local governments prepare for and adapt to the growing effects of climate change. When that commitment is broken, it puts people’s safety, homes and futures at risk.”\n___\nThis story has been corrected to remove a sentence that was not included in an emergency department statement.\n__\nBedayn reported from Denver.

    "body": "Officials airlift evacuees to safety after the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastate Alaska villages\nOfficials airlift evacuees to safety after the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastate Alaska villages\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Officials in Alaska rushed Tuesday to evacuate and find housing for people from tiny coastal villages devastated by the remnants of Typhoon Halong. But the remote location and severe damage are limiting their options as they race against other impending storms and the onset of winter.\nHigh winds and surging waters battered low-lying, isolated Alaska Native communities along the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in southwest Alaska, nearly 500 miles (800 km) from Anchorage, over the weekend. The Coast Guard plucked two dozen people from their homes after the structures floated out to sea in high water, three people were missing or dead, and hundreds of people were staying in school shelters — including one with no working toilets, officials said.\nThe system followed a storm that struck parts of western Alaska days earlier.\nAcross the region, more than 1,500 people were displaced. Dozens had been flown to a shelter set up in the National Guard armory in the regional hub city of Bethel, a community of 6,000 people, and officials are considering flying evacuees to longer-term shelter or emergency housing in Fairbanks and Anchorage as they run out of room there.\nFuel storage depots intended to support communities in the region had apparently been damaged, threatening pollution that could harm the fish and game the Alaska Native residents rely on for subsistence. Some people in the area may have lost freezers full of food such as salmon and moose intended to get them through the winter.\nThe hardest-hit communities included Kipnuk, population 715, and Kwigillingok, population 380. They are off the state’s main road system and reachable this time of year only by water or by air.\n“It’s catastrophic in Kipnuk. Let’s not paint any other picture,” Mark Roberts, incident commander with the state emergency management division, told a news conference Tuesday. “We are doing everything we can to continue to support that community, but it is as bad as you can think.”\nHeartbreaking moment\nAmong those awaiting evacuation to Bethel on Tuesday was Brea Paul, of Kwigillingok, who said in a text message that she had seen about 20 homes floating away through the moonlight on Saturday night.\n“Some houses would blink their phone lights at us like they were asking for help but we couldn’t even do anything,” she wrote.\nThe following morning, she recorded video of a house submerged nearly to its roofline as it floated past her home.\nPaul and her neighbors had a long meeting in the local schoolhouse gym on Monday night, singing songs of praises as they tried to figure out what to do next, she said. Neither she nor most everyone else knows where they will end up.\n“It’s so heartbreaking saying goodbye to our community members not knowing when we’d get to see each other,” she said.\nOne woman was found dead in Kwigillingok, and authorities on Monday night called off the search for two men after their home floated away.\nIn Kwigillingok, the school was the only facility with full power, but it had no working toilet, and 400 people stayed there Monday night. Workers were trying to fix the bathrooms; a situation report from the state emergency operations center on Tuesday noted that “honey buckets are being used.”\nA preliminary assessment showed every home in the village was damaged by the storm, with about three dozen having drifted from their foundations, the emergency management office said.\nPower systems flooded in Napakiak, and severe erosion was reported in Toksook Bay. In Nightmute, officials said, fuel drums were reported floating in the community, and there was a scent of fuel in the air and a sheen on the water.\nOfficials activated members of the National Guard to help with the emergency response, and crews were trying to take advantage of any breaks in the weather to fly in food, water, generators and communication equipment.\nLong road to recovery ahead, officials say\nOfficials warned of a long road to recovery and a need for continued support for the hardest-hit communities. Most rebuilding supplies would have to be transported in, and there is little time left with winter just around the corner.\n“Indigenous communities in Alaska are resilient,” said Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “But, you know, when you have an entire community where effectively every house is damaged and many of them will be uninhabitable with winter knocking at the door now, there’s only there’s only so much that any individual or any small community can do.”\nThoman said the storm was likely fueled by the warm surface waters of the Pacific Ocean, which has been heating up because of human-caused climate change and making storms more intense.\nThe remnants of another storm, Typhoon Merbok, caused damage across a massive swath of western Alaska three years ago.\n__\nJohnson and Attanasio reported from Seattle.\n___\nThis story corrects the hometown of Brea Paul to Kwigillingok.",

    "body": "State attorneys general sue Trump administration for canceled solar program funding\nThe attorneys general of more than a dozen states on Thursday sued the Trump administration over the termination of $7 billion in funding intended for affordable solar energy projects across the U.S.\nThe coalition, which also included the District of Columbia and other stakeholders, argued in the lawsuit that the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program violated the law governing federal agencies and the constitutional separation of powers. The program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.\nIncreasing the use of solar energy reduces reliance on coal, oil and natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for electricity is a primary driver of climate change globally because they emit greenhouse gases that trap the Earth’s heat.\nThe EPA rescinded the Solar for All funds in August after President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress a month earlier, with Administrator Lee Zeldin calling the program a “boondoggle.”\nThe EPA said in an email Thursday that it does not comment on pending litigation.\nThursday’s filing in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was led by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, and argues the termination of the funding was unlawful. It names the EPA and Zeldin as defendants.\nJoining the lawsuit are the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of whom are Democrats, as well as the governor of Kentucky, the chair of the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.\n“Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax,” Brown said in a statement.\nAdvocates have touted the program not only for its benefits to lower-income communities needing access to money for clean-energy projects, but also for local workforces and to keep electricity prices reasonable.\n“At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement.\nA similar group of states filed a separate lawsuit Wednesday in the Court of Federal Claims against the Trump administration arguing that the program funding cancellation is a breach of contract and said they are seeking to recover monetary damages.\nThis week’s litigation ramps up the pressure on the Trump administration over the program. Nonprofit organizations and other groups sued over Solar for All funding for similar reasoning earlier this month, and Harris County in Texas filed a lawsuit last week over its award. More than two dozen Democratic senators also wrote a letter to Zeldin this week calling for the program to be restored.\nSolar for All was affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding, formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, terminated by the Trump administration in March.\nThe canceled $27 billion is just one example of the efforts the administration has taken against clean energy. Trump has invested in fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal while slashing climate regulation, standing in the way of clean energy developments and reversing environmental policy.\n___\nRead more of AP’s climate coverage.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "California mpox cases raise concerns. But health officials say the risk remains low\nNEW YORK (AP) — Two Californians diagnosed with mpox may be the first U.S. cases resulting from the local spread of a different version of the virus, health officials said.\nThe Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services this week confirmed the first case through testing at a state lab. Los Angeles County health officials on Thursday reported a second, similar case.\nThe risk to the public is low, officials say.\nThese are not the U.S. first cases of what is known as clade I mpox. But all six previous cases were among international travelers who were believed to have been infected abroad.\nBoth infected people in California were hospitalized, and they are now recovering at home. Officials declined to give other details. But “at this point in our investigations, we have not identified any association between the two cases,” Long Beach health department acting public affairs officer Jennifer Ann Gonzalez said.\nLong Beach is located in Los Angeles County but has its own city health department. Investigators there say they have not found a close contact who traveled abroad, nor have they confirmed additional cases. A few of the person’s close contacts have been given a vaccine, said Nora Balanji, the Long Beach department’s communicable disease coordinator.\n“We don’t have any proof that there has been ongoing community transmission,” she said. “It’s something we’re looking into. That’s something we’re concerned about.”\nMpox — also known as monkeypox — is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that is in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa.\nMilder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.\nOne version of the virus — called clade II — was the source of an international health crisis in 2022, when infections escalated in dozens of countries, mostly among men who have sex with men. At one point, the U.S. was averaging close to 500 cases per day.\nThe infections were rarely fatal, but many people suffered painful skin lesions for weeks. Those outbreaks waned later that year, thanks in part to the Jynneos vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic.\nThe other version — known as clade I — likewise can spread through sex, but also through other forms of contact. In Africa it has infected a broader range of people, including children.\nA newer form of the clade I virus has been widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. The World Health Organization declared the situation a public health emergency, but last month it said the problem had waned enough that it was no longer an international emergency.\nStill, “it’s concerning if this virus has come here and now is starting to be transmitted from person to person,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.\nThe case report comes amid a federal government shutdown and the layoffs of hundreds of employees at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the agency that usually would be involved in responding.\nBalanji said a few CDC experts have been available to talk to her department about the situation. But Schaffner noted that “the longer the shutdown, the more impaired public health responses are to any outbreaks.”\nA U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson referred questions to local health officials.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But cuts to federal staff and programs that address chronic disease could endanger that progress, according to a new report released Thursday.\nNineteen states had obesity rates of 35% or higher in 2024, down from 23 states the year before, according to an analysis of the latest data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC data was analyzed by the nonprofit group Trust for America’s Health.\nThe group’s analysis follows a CDC report last year that found that the overall rate of obesity in the U.S. is high but holding steady, affecting about 40% of the population.\nWhile the decline is positive, “it’s too soon to call it a trend,” said Dr. J. Nadine Gracia, president and chief executive for TFAH.\nAnd with recent federal funding cuts, staff layoffs and eliminated programs, “this potential progress is also at risk,” Gracia said.\nA U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman said in an email that the administration is “encouraged by the new data showing progress in the fight against obesity.”\n“We are restructuring public health programs to eliminate waste, reduce bureaucracy, and redirect resources toward real prevention,” said spokesman Andrew Nixon.\nThe latest report analyzed data from the CDC’s 2024 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which uses annual telephone surveys to collect data on health behaviors and chronic conditions in U.S. states and territories.\nIt showed that 19 states had obesity rates among adults of 35% or higher, 22 states had rates between 30% and 35% and nine states had obesity rates of below 30%. The rates varied from a low of 25% in Colorado to a high of more than 40% in West Virginia.\nBetween 2023 and 2024, no state had statistically significant increases or decreases in their obesity rates, after 18 states saw significant increases in the previous five years, the report found.\nBefore 2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%, By 2019, a dozen states had rates that high — and the number continued to climb.\nIn adults, obesity is defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher. Body mass index is a calculation based on height and weight. Obesity is a chronic disease linked to a host of serious health problems including diabetes, stroke, cancer and heart disease.\nIt’s not clear exactly what may be driving the apparent improvements in obesity. Wider use of drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound — which target appetite and slow digestion — could be starting to show up in reported data, said Aviva Musicus, a science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. Increased support for nutrition assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic might also be a factor, she suggested.\nThe report also details a broad range of federal, state and local efforts that focus on improving nutrition and boosting physical activity, said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health expert who specializes in obesity.\n“I think the report would argue that some of these interventions may actually be successful,” said Cunningham, who was not involved with the research. “That would suggest that there are possibly ways in which we could prevent obesity at the population level, which would be a really, really big deal.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "What is the chikungunya virus now transmitted in the US for the first time in years?\nA person living in the suburbs of New York City has tested positive for chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that is more often seen in South America and hasn’t been transmitted on the U.S. mainland in a decade.\nHealth officials said the virus, which often causes fever and joint pain, was identified in a patient on Long Island who started experiencing symptoms in August after having traveled outside of the region, but not out of the country.\nThe patient likely got the virus from a mosquito bite, but it isn’t clear where that happened. The virus has not been detected in local mosquito pools and isn’t spread directly from one person to another.\nHere’s what to know about chikungunya:\nWhat is chikungunya?\nChikungunya is a disease caused by a virus of the same name.\nThe chikungunya virus was first identified in people sickened during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Its name is derived from a word in the Makonde language, which means “that which bends up,” due to the severe pain it can cause.\nChikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly causes mild symptoms. The majority of people who get chikungunya recover without needing medical attention after one to two weeks.\nWhat are the symptoms of chikungunya?\nChikungunya typically produces symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue and a rash.\nBut in rare cases, it can cause debilitating joint pain that persists for months or even years. Patients who get severely ill often require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage.\nThe World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions.\nIs there a treatment or vaccine?\nThere is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain.\nTwo vaccines have been approved in several regions, including Britain, Brazil, Canada and Europe. Those are mostly targeted at travelers and are not widely available in the countries most affected by chikungunya.\nWhere does chikungunya normally occur?\nChikungunya causes regular outbreaks in Africa, Asia and the Americas, with occasional small epidemics in Europe.\nAs of August, there have been about 317,000 cases of chikungunya this year, including 135 deaths in 16 countries and territories, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The countries that reported the highest number of infections were Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Peru.\nWhat’s happening in the United States?\nThe case confirmed in New York was the first locally acquired instance in the United States since 2015, meaning the person was infected without traveling elsewhere. Ten years ago, one person was infected in Texas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two cases were recorded in U.S. territories in 2019.\nIt’s the first time that a locally acquired case has ever been detected in New York, the state Health Department said.\nHealth officials said the virus can be transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected traveler, becomes infected and bites another person.\nThe type of mosquito known to transmit chikungunya, the Aedes albopictus mosquito, is present in parts of downstate New York, and people should take care to avoid being bitten by wearing long sleeves and removing standing water from things like flowerpots, health officials said.\nHowever, colder nighttime temperatures currently being recorded in New York make the transmission risk in the area “very low,” state Health Commissioner James McDonald said in a statement.\nAlthough locally acquired cases have been virtually nonexistent in recent years, the CDC has tracked a number of travel-related infections in the U.S., including 199 in 2024 and 152 in 2023, according to agency data.\nAre we seeing more chikungunya outbreaks?\nYes.\nThe number of outbreaks has increased since 2000, just as there have been more outbreaks of other mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue and Zika, according to Robert Jones, an assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nJones said in a statement that in 2013, chikungunya was first seen in the island of St. Martin and that over the next three years, cases were confirmed in almost 50 countries in the Caribbean and the Americas, with more than 1 million suspected cases.\nJones said the risk of chikungunya epidemics has risen due to climate change and urban expansion.\n__\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "FDA to offer faster drug reviews to companies promoting ‘national priorities’\nWASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. regulators will begin offering faster reviews to new medicines that administration officials deem as promoting “the health interests of Americans,” under a new initiative announced Tuesday.\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency will aim to review select drugs in one to two months. FDA’s long-standing accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Regular drug reviews take about 10 months.\nSince arriving at the FDA in April, Makary has repeatedly told FDA staff they need to “challenge assumptions” and rethink procedures. In a medical journal commentary published last week, Makary suggested the agency could conduct “rapid or instant reviews,” pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed.\nFor the new program, the FDA will issue a limited number of “national priority vouchers” to companies “aligned with U.S. national priorities,” the agency said in a statement. The special designation will give the selected companies access to extra FDA communications, streamlined staff reviews and the ability to submit much of their product information in advance.\nSpeeding up drug approvals has long been a priority of the pharmaceutical industry, which has successfully lobbied Congress to create a variety of special programs and pathways for faster reviews.\nMany aspects of the plan announced Tuesday overlap with older programs. But the broad criteria for receiving a voucher will give FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies can benefit from the fastest reviews.\n“The ultimate goal is to bring more cures and meaningful treatments to the American public,” Makary said in a statement.\nMakary said he will prioritize vouchers for companies pursuing products that address health crises, deliver “innovative cures” or address other unmet public health needs.\nAn administration official said the program wouldn’t change FDA approval standards.\n“Without altering how new treatments are evaluated — just when — the FDA’s new voucher program is a common sense reform that maintains rigorous clinical standards while streamlining needless bureaucracy,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.\nSeparate from this week’s announcement, Makary recently suggested the FDA should be willing to ease its scientific requirements for certain drugs targeting rare conditions. In such cases, the agency could consider waiving its requirement for randomized studies, in which researchers track patients over time to evaluate drug safety and effectiveness. Such trials are generally considered the gold standard of medical research, though the FDA has increasingly been willing to accept smaller, less-definitive studies for rare or life-threatening diseases.\nIn several recent cases, the FDA has faced criticism for approving drugs based on preliminary data that didn’t ultimately show benefits for patients.\nThe push to rapidly accelerated drug approvals is the opposite approach that Makary and his boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have taken on vaccines.\nPromising a “return to gold-standard science,” Kennedy previously announced that all new vaccines would have to be compared to placebo, or a dummy shot, to win approval. Kennedy and Makary also have announced a stricter policy on seasonal updates to COVID-19 shots, saying they will have to undergo new testing before they can be approved for use in healthy children and most adults.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Sex is a big market for the AI industry. ChatGPT won’t be the first to try to profit from it\nSex is a big market for the AI industry. ChatGPT won’t be the first to try to profit from it\nChatGPT will be able to have kinkier conversations after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the artificial intelligence company will soon allow its chatbot to engage in “erotica for verified adults.”\nOpenAI won’t be the first to try to profit from sexualized AI. Sexual content was a top draw for AI tools almost as soon as the boom in AI-generated imagery and words erupted in 2022.\nBut the companies that were early to embrace mature AI also encountered legal and societal minefields and harmful abuse as a growing number of people have turned to the technology for companionship or titillation.\nWill a sexier ChatGPT be different? After three years of largely banning mature content, Altman said Wednesday that his company is “not the elected moral police of the world” and ready to allow “more user freedom for adults” at the same time as it sets new limits for teens.\n“In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here,” Altman wrote on social media platform X, whose owner, Elon Musk, has also introduced an animated AI character that flirts with paid subscribers.\nFor now, unlike Musk’s Grok chatbot, paid subscriptions to ChatGPT are mostly pitched for professional use. But letting the chatbot become a friend or romantic partner could be another way for the world’s most valuable startup, which is losing more money than it makes, to turn a profit that could justify its $500 billion valuation.\n“They’re not really earning much through subscriptions so having erotic content will bring them quick money,” said Zilan Qian, a fellow at Oxford University’s China Policy Lab who has studied the popularity of dating-based chatbots in the U.S. and China.\nThere are already about 29 million active users of AI chatbots designed specifically for romantic or sexual bonding, and that’s not counting people who use conventional chatbots in that way, according to research published by Qian earlier this month.\nIt also doesn’t include users of Character.AI, which is fighting a lawsuit that alleges a chatbot modeled after “Game of Thrones” character Daenerys Targaryen formed a sexually abusive relationship with a 14-year-old boy and pushed him to kill himself. OpenAI is facing a lawsuit from the family of a 16-year-old ChatGPT user who died by suicide in April.\nQian said she worries about the toll on real-world relationships when mainstream chatbots, already prone to sycophancy, are primed for 24-hour availability serving sexually explicit content.\n“ChatGPT has voice chat versions. I would expect that in the future, if they were to go down this way — voice, text, visual — it’s all there,” she said.\nHumans who fall in love with human-like machines have long been a literary cautionary tale, from popular science fiction of the last century to the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion, obsessed with a woman he sculpted from ivory. Creating such a machine would seem like an unusual detour for OpenAI, founded a decade ago as a nonprofit dedicated to safely building better-than-human AI.\nAltman said on a podcast in August that OpenAI has tried to resist the temptation to introduce products that could “juice growth or revenue” but be “very misaligned” with its long-term mission. Asked for a specific example, he gave one: “Well, we haven’t put a sexbot avatar in ChatGPT yet.”\nIdaho-based startup Civitai, a platform for AI-generated art, learned the hard way that making money off mature AI won’t be an easy path.\n“When we launched the site, it was an intentional choice to allow mature content,” said Justin Maier, the company’s co-founder and CEO, in an interview last year.\nBacked by the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has also invested in OpenAI, the Idaho startup was one of several that tried to capitalize on the sudden popularity of tools like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney that enabled people to type a description and conjure up almost any kind of image. Part of Stable Diffusion’s initial popularity was the ease with which it could generate a new kind of synthetic and highly customized pornography.\n“What we had seen was that there was a lot of interest in mature content,” Maier said. Training these AI systems, known as models, on “mature themes actually made it so that these models were more capable of human anatomy and resulted in actually better models,” he said.\n“We didn’t want to prevent the kind of growth that actually increased everything for the entire community, whether you were interested in mature content or Pixar,” Maier said. “So we allowed it early on and have always kind of had this battle of making it so that we can keep things filtered and safe, if that’s not what you’re interested in. We wanted to ultimately give the control to the user to decide what they would see on the site and what their experience would be.”\nThat also invited abuse. Civitai last year implemented new measures to detect and remove sexual images depicting children, but it remained a hub for AI-generated pornography, including fake images of celebrities. Confronting increasing pressure, including from credit card processors and a new law against nonconsensual images signed by President Donald Trump, Civitai earlier this year blocked users from creating deepfake images of real people. Engagement dropped.\nAnother company that hasn’t shied away from mature content is Baltimore-based Nomi.ai, though its founder and CEO Alex Cardinell said its companion chatbots are “strictly” for users over 18 and were never marketed to kids. They are also not designed for sex, though Cardinell said in an interview earlier this year that people who build platonic relationships with their chatbot might find it veering into a romantic one.\n“It’s kind of very user-dependent for where they’re kind of missing the human gap in their life. And I think that’s different for everyone,” he said.\nHe declined to guess how many Nomi users are having erotic conversations with the chatbot, comparing it to real-life partners who might do “mature content things” for some part of their lives but “all sorts of other stuff together as well.”\n“We’re not monitoring user conversations like that,” Cardinell said.\nAltman’s announcement that erotica for adults could arrive on ChatGPT in December came a day after California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation that would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old if it was “foreseeable” that they would engage in “erotic or sexually explicit interactions” with kids or encourage them to harm themselves. The tech industry lobbied heavily against the bill, which Newsom said was too broad, but OpenAI, Meta and others introduced new age restrictions and parental controls for AI-teen interactions.",

    "body": "Microsoft: Russia, China increasingly using AI to escalate cyberattacks on the US\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have sharply increased their use of artificial intelligence to deceive people online and mount cyberattacks against the United States, according to new research from Microsoft.\nThis July, the company identified more than 200 instances of foreign adversaries using AI to create fake content online, more than double the number from July 2024 and more than ten times the number seen in 2023.\nThe findings, published Thursday in Microsoft’s annual digital threats report, show how foreign adversaries are adopting new and innovative tactics in their efforts to weaponize the internet as a tool for espionage and deception.\nAI’s potential said to be exploited by US foes\nAmerica’s adversaries, as well as criminal gangs and hacking companies, have exploited AI’s potential, using it to automate and improve cyberattacks, to spread inflammatory disinformation and to penetrate sensitive systems. AI can translate poorly worded phishing emails into fluent English, for example, as well as generate digital clones of senior government officials.\nGovernment cyber operations often aim to obtain classified information, undermine supply chains, disrupt critical public services or spread disinformation. Cyber criminals on the other hand work for profit by stealing corporate secrets or using ransomware to extort payments from their victims. These gangs are responsible for the wide majority of cyberattacks in the world and in some cases have built partnerships with countries like Russia.\nIncreasingly, these attackers are using AI to target governments, businesses and critical systems like hospitals and transportation networks, according to Amy Hogan-Burney, Microsoft’s vice president for customer security and trust, who oversaw the report. Many U.S. companies and organizations, meanwhile, are getting by with outdated cyber defenses, even as Americans expand their networks with new digital connections.\nCompanies, governments, organizations and individuals must take the threat seriously if they are to protect themselves amid escalating digital threats, she said.\n“We see this as a pivotal moment where innovation is going so fast,” Hogan-Burney said. “This is the year when you absolutely must invest in your cybersecurity basics,”\nUS is a popular target\nThe U.S. is the top target for cyberattacks, with criminals and foreign adversaries targeting companies, governments and organizations in the U.S. more than any other country. Israel and Ukraine were the second and third most popular targets, showing how military conflicts involving those two nations have spilled over into the digital realm.\nRussia, China and Iran have denied that they use cyber operations for espionage, disruption and disinformation. China, for instance, says the U.S. is trying to “ smear ” Beijing while conducting its own cyberattacks.\nIn a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Thursday, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said Iran rejects allegations that it is responsible for cyberattacks on the U.S. while reserving the right to defend itself.\n“The Islamic Republic of Iran does not initiate any form of offensive cyber operation against any state,” the mission wrote in the statement. “However, as a victim of cyber operations, it will respond to any such threat in a manner proportionate to its nature and scale.”\nNorth Korea has pioneered a scheme in which it uses AI personas to create American identities allowing them to apply for remote tech jobs. North Korea’s authoritarian government pockets the salaries, while the hackers use their access to steal secrets or install malware.\nIt’s the kind of digital threat that will face more American organizations in the years to come as sophisticated AI programs make it easier for bad actors to deceive, according to Nicole Jiang, CEO of Fable, a San Francisco-based security company that uses AI to sniff out fake employees. AI is not only a tool for hackers, but also a critical defense against digital attackers, Jiang said.\n“Cyber is a cat-and-mouse game,” she said. “Access, data, information, money: That’s what they’re after.”",

Raked by north Atlantic winds and nibbled by thousands of sheep, the nearly treeless islands have poor soil and little room for planting. Potatoes and rhubarb are local staples.\nBut some residents have had enough of importing almost all their food from the rest of Europe and beyond. Many products are stamped with the flag of Denmark, under which the islands are self-governing.\nThere are efforts to grow more adventurous crops like kale, seen as hardy elsewhere in the world, and to promote local products — from seaweed to meat and fish “fermented” by the salty air.\nThat work can be seen in the Faroese capital of Torshavn, where the tiny farmers’ market is held one Sunday a month for much of the year. In September, a few stalls offered meats, bags of kale and cabbage and seasoned salt next to the overcast harbor.\nThe vegetables were priced at around 40 Faroese krona (over $6) per bag, a reminder of the high prices for food in the remote islands whose closest neighbors are Iceland, Scotland and Norway.\nCups of soup made from fermented local radishes — and imported beans — sold for 75 krona, or over $11, with a piece of bread.\nThe farmers’ market is part of Matkovin, a project set up by a local couple to promote food producers. It notes the growing international interest in Faroese food, including a Michelin-starred restaurant and a network of home-cooked meals for tourists called “heimablidni.”\n“There is a divide, though, between this romantic vision of the Faroese food culture and the everyday state of things, where the majority of our food is imported from far-away countries,” the project says. It adds: “Few Faroese foods are available in the shops, and we are never told where the producer of these foods is located. The Faroese food producer is invisible.“\nSome Faroese said the COVID-19 pandemic and its shocks to the supply chain raised serious questions about food security, along with a large labor strike in May 2024 in the islands that led to rationing.\nThe Matkovin project highlights a dozen local food producers of such things as goose carcasses, pesto and liver pate, along with bios that often describe the craggy islands’ challenges.\n“One half the year we live on the shadow side, as the sun sets for the last time in Trøllanes on Michaelmas on Sept. 29, and we do not see the sun again before St. Gregory’s Day on March 12. It is indeed very dark here during the winter months,” says the bio for Uppistova, a small farm on the island of Kalsoy where the AP purchased eggs and rhubarb jam.\nMeanwhile, a project called Veltan is working to coax a wider variety of vegetables from greenhouses on the southern island of Sandoy, though offerings remain hardier ones like peas and carrots.\n“We at Veltan believe that in Faroe Islands it should be possible to eat Faroese vegetables!” the project says.\nThe work builds on growing local pride that is showcasing the islands’ more adventurous food offerings, which have emerged over the years from remoteness and tough living.\nThe Michelin-starred restaurant Paz offers a tasting menu at nearly $400 for “what the land and sea offer at any given moment.”\nIts menu draws on seafood, which drives the economy, and the local fermenting process by which fish and meat are hung in wood-slatted buildings and left to cure in the sea air. Locals call it an acquired taste.\nThere is still much work ahead. At a steakhouse in the sheep-roamed islands’ second-largest community, Klaksvik, a server was asked where they sourced their lamb.\n“New Zealand,” she said.",

    "body": "Take a ‘stormcation’ in the dramatic Faroe Islands, where James Bond died\nTake a ‘stormcation’ in the dramatic Faroe Islands, where James Bond died\nKALSOY ISLAND, Faroe Islands (AP) — The tiny Faroe Islands in the north Atlantic could be a poor choice for travelers with vertigo, seasickness or a fear of enclosed spaces. There are crumbling cliffs, sudden gale-force winds and hillsides so steep that even the sheep can tumble.\nThree tourists disappeared over two days in September. Police told the media their last locations were near a well-known waterfall that drops into the sea. Be careful, a shaken staffer at the site’s entrance said days later. “Come back.”\nThe risks come with landscapes so dramatic that one became the site for James Bond’s end in “No Time to Die.” Now the Faroe Islands, a self-governing territory under Denmark, like Greenland, are trying to handle a growing number of travelers also drawn by bird-watching, adventurous eating and “coolcations” as global temperatures rise.\nIts sure-footed residents once hiked over mountain passes and maneuvered wooden boats onto rocky shores just to visit church or each other. Unlike tourists, they know when to stay away from hiking trails alongside unprotected cliffs, and how disorienting sudden fogs can be.\n“When you make a mistake here, nature usually wins,” a food truck vendor at one popular site said.\nIt’s easier than ever to learn that lesson while exploring the Faroe Islands, which for now are largely free of the zip-lined commercialization of one of its nearest neighbors, Iceland.\nA growing network of undersea tunnels, including what’s called the world’s first undersea roundabout, are helping to link the 18 islands. Rugged isolation is giving way to smooth highways, and Airbnb has hundreds of listings among a population of over 50,000 people.\nA new co-chairmanship of the Arctic Council is bringing more global visibility, along with a stunning run toward its first soccer World Cup.\n‘Closed for maintenance’\nAuthorities are trying to both encourage tourism and protect the Faroe Islands from it. A yearly “closed for maintenance” program began in 2019, with volunteers from around the world chosen to help with anti-erosion efforts, path upkeep and other work. The national museum later launched a project to protect lands and biodiversity.\nAnd this year, the tourism office introduced self-navigating tours that steer visitors from the churned-mud trails of the most popular spots to lesser-known areas.\nTour routes are revealed online as you go along. One sends users to a seaside village that hosts a popular music festival, followed by a tiny botanical garden, a fjord-side memorial to a deadly shipwreck and a small forest plantation enjoyed by Faroese on the otherwise treeless islands.\nThe last leg was along a one-lane road that at times had no guardrail between its lack of shoulder and the drop to the sea. Sheep walked along one stretch, another reason for visitors to stay alert in the stunning surroundings. (There’s a police number to call if a driver hits one.)\nVisitors who love the outdoors can easily spend a week in the Faroe Islands cycling, fishing, trying an emerging sauna scene, eating sushi from locally farmed salmon and shopping for newly knitted wool sweaters. In the summer, boat tours include music concerts inside a sea cave or puffin-watching.\nWinters are fierce — a ferryman said a storm two years ago ripped the roof from an old house next to the AP’s seaside rental cottage in Sydradalur — but interest in the islands is starting to extend the peak tourist season into October.\nFerocious winds and bewildered sheep\nVillages, especially in the wilder northern region, can have just a handful of residents. There are few tourist-focused businesses outside the capital, Torshavn, but the village of Gjogv has a welcoming guesthouse and cafe, and the village of Fuglafjordur has a charming main street and visitors’ center. English is widely spoken and displayed.\nJust be prepared for rain in the often-shifting weather, with webcams available from popular locations.\nAnd mind the guidance, even scolding, that some Faroese have posted for tourists who overstep.\n“Due to unmannerly behavior and lack of quietness on the graves, the cemetery is closed,” said a sign on the church in the village of Saksun.\n“Do not wash your shoes in the sink!” said a sign at the ferry stop on Kalsoy island. A worker at the island’s unexpected Thai restaurant — a sign of the small but growing migrant population — estimated that about 200 tourists a day came to a much-photographed lighthouse there this summer.\nThe official Visit Faroe Islands doesn’t hold back, either, as it balances the appeal of growing tourism with the responsibility of warning travelers. Finding equilibrium is a long practice in the nation whose fishing-dominated economy requires cordial ties with a range of countries including Russia and China.\n“Stormcation,” the Visit Faroe Islands site declares, but adds: “Ferocious wind can overturn cars, fling bicycles, wheelbarrows — and sheep — or anything else that’s not anchored down.”",

    "body": "Throwback styles meet modern tech for a retro revival in our living rooms\nThrowback styles meet modern tech for a retro revival in our living rooms\nIt might start with a cassette deck that streams Spotify and charges your phone. It doesn’t have to stop there.\nThese days, yesterday is big business.\nA retro revival is underway in the design world: mushroom-shaped lamps, walnut stereo consoles, daisy dishware, neon Polaroid cameras. It’s like our homes just hustled over from “One Day at a Time” or “That ‘70s Show” or moonwalked in from “Thriller”-era 1982.\nWelcome to the retro reset, where ‘70s, ’80s and ‘90s aesthetics are getting a second life. It’s not just in fashion and film but in home décor and tech. Whether you actually lived through it or long for a past you never experienced, nostalgia is fueling a surge of interest from Gen X to Gen Z in throwback styles that blend vintage charm with modern convenience.\nOld-school tech, new-school tricks\nA big part of the trend is tech that looks analog but functions digitally. Think portable CD players in the kind of candy colors popular at Radio Shack in the 1970s, AM/FM radios equipped with USB outputs, or turntables with Bluetooth amplification to wireless speakers. Compact radios styled after 1970s transistor models now double as smart speakers.\nThere’s even a growing market for clunky-but-charming mini cathode-ray-style TVs — and boomboxes with streaming capability. It’s as if the Carter, Reagan and Clinton eras have collided with the latest of the digital age.\nWhat draws us? Some of it is the tactile appeal of dials and buttons — of interacting with something that feels solid, more “real.”\nIn a room, these elements aren’t just nods to the past. They’re also aesthetic statements that add way more character than a giant, flat, black screen, or a “smart” sound system you can’t even see. Stereo consoles in a woodgrain finish or a pastel-colored lacquer offer not only music but a nice furniture addition to a space. (Though who knows: Will those minimalist black screens be ”retro” one day for our children and grandchildren?)\n“Whether it’s turntables, cassette players, speakers or musical instruments, there’s definitely a fascination among younger audiences with analog technology and how things worked before the digital age,” says Emmanuel Plat, merchandising director for MoMAstore, the design shop at New York’s Museum of Modern Art.\nThe store has Tivoli’s Model One table radio, with a throwback-style, wood-grain frame, circle speaker grill and knobs, but 2025’s sound quality and connectivity. They’re also stocking pocket synthesizers, Bluetooth turntables, and “Peanuts”-themed Polaroid cameras and cassette players.\nWho’s into it — and why\nGen Z is seeing it all with fresh eyes, and enjoying the hunt for vintage or vintage-look stuff. Millennials and Gen X may enjoy reliving their childhood aesthetics.\nAnd that can be comforting in today’s stressed world, says Joseph Sgambatti, 37, a design journalist in New York City.\n“Nostalgia-driven design choices become comforts that help us cope,” he says.\nThere’s also an ironic, social-media component to the trend.\n“Midcentury modern and retro design objects are simple, often show-stopping artifacts,” Sgambatti says. “These finds carry a lot of social currency in a generation that prioritizes publishing their life online.”\nStyle trends do tend to arrive in cycles — think “Happy Days” portraying the 1950s for the 1970s, or the current Gen-Z crush on Y2K fashion. Plus, a steady diet of nostalgia-rich media from “Stranger Things” to “Barbie” has reintroduced retro design to younger audiences.\nBut there’s also an emotional component. After years of digital overload and pandemic-era disruptions, we’re gravitating toward styles that feel warmer, softer — more human, even.\nColors that carry meaning\nIf you walk by the E.C. Reems Academy, an elementary school in Oakland, California, or Houston’s Children’s Assessment Center, you can’t miss the vibrant graphic murals done by Berkeley-based Project Color Corps. The group, which helps transform libraries, schools and other community spaces with eye-catching wall art, often uses graphics, typefaces and an overall palette with a ’70s and ’80s vibe.\nIn the 1970s, “we sought solace in warm, earthy tones that symbolized grounding and stability. Browns, oranges, olive greens and deep yellows dominated the aesthetic landscape, reflecting the growing Earth movement,” says Laura Guido-Clark, who founded the nonprofit.\nIt was a different aesthetic in the ‘80s — one dripping with materialism, consumerism, the emergence of ‘“yuppie” culture, says Guido-Clark. “Neon colors, bold patterns and vibrant fashion choices.”\nAnd there’s affection for that, too.\nHer group recently worked with the design firm Gensler on a lounge space at Chicago’s NeoCon trade fair for commercial interior design. The space featured retro-flavored colors and motifs.\nGensler’s design director, Marianne Starke, says the colors draw viewers into a sensory experience that might be rooted in memory: “A popsicle on a ‘90s summer day, an ’80s striped T-shirt, a rollerskating rink in the ‘70s.”\nFurniture with curves and confidence\nIn furniture, the revival of those slightly distant decades leans toward soft silhouettes, rounded edges and a low-slung vibe. Arched bookshelves, bubble chairs, Lucite tables and terrazzo finishes have all reentered the conversation. Wallpaper and textile patterns feature bold geometrics, Memphis-style squiggles and Pop-Artsy botanicals.\nIt’s a deliberate swing away from the chilly gray-on-white-on-gray look that farmhouse modern décor gave us for the past couple of decades.\nIn the process, eras get conflated. Who’s to say whether an inspiration or design comes precisely from the ‘70s, the ’80s or the ‘90s — or contains elements of all three?\nDesigners are even revisiting some once-controversial elements of the disco era: Smoked glass, chrome accents and mirrored surfaces are making subtle (not a word often used in connection with the 1970s) comebacks in upscale interiors and product lines.\nWhether it’s a lava lamp grooving on a media console, daisies and doves dancing on wallpaper, or a sofa rocking a bunch of ruffly chintz pillows, the retro revival feels less like a gimmick and more like a shift in how people want to live — integrating elements of the past that offer comfort and delight.\nAs long as those cassette players keep syncing to Bluetooth and we can stream “Annie Hall,” “Saturday Night Fever” or “Miami Vice,” the past, it seems, is here to stay — at least until our own moment inevitably becomes a nostalgia play in itself.",

But this weekend, the battle converged in the Dallas suburbs during Stuckey’s second annual “Share the Arrows” women’s conference, where throngs of Bible-wielding Christian women gathered at the Credit Union Texas Event Center to be inspired in person by their favorite online influencers, including Jinger Duggar Vuolo from the hit show “19 Kids and Counting” and homeschooling “momfluencer” Abbie Halberstadt.\nHeld just one month since the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the event also served as a rallying cry for women whose faith has been reignited by the death of the far-right political activist.\n“There’s a new ache in all of our hearts since Charlie passed, and we’re just so excited to keep this fire burning. This is a great way to rekindle that in all of us,” Rachel Jonson, a 28-year-old mother from Corinth, Texas, told RNS as she sat near the back of the arena, rocking the infant wrapped to her chest.\n___\nThis content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n___\nTo these women, Kirk was an evangelist turned martyr who died for defending conservative beliefs about Scripture, family, abortion, gender and sexuality that they, too, hold sacred. In the weeks after Kirk’s passing, the conference saw a swell of more than 2,000 women purchase tickets. And the conference aimed to equip these women to boldly enter the fray of the culture wars. Though Stuckey argues the battle is primarily about defending biblical truths, she says political engagement is a byproduct.\n“This is a fight to which every single Christian is called, and it’s not fought on a physical battlefield or even only in the public square,” said Stuckey from the conference stage. “This is a spiritual battle that is waged in our homes and in our neighborhoods, at school, at your job.”\nAn hour before the event’s 9 a.m. start, thousands of women formed a line wrapping around the event center, clutching notebooks and the clear bags dictated by security protocols. Once inside, attendees were greeted warmly by sponsors in pastel-colored stalls peddling natural cosmetics, Bibles, nutritional supplements and merch with quippy sayings like “you bet your stretch marks.”\nNearly everyone who spoke with RNS said they were excited to be with likeminded women. Waiting in her seat before the event, Anna Tumulty, 40, from Springtown, Texas, said she brought her daughter Lily to the conference for her 16th birthday “to help prepare her for her future walk with Christ, and to prepare her to face the problems in today’s culture.”\nCarolina Graver, 29, flew in from Palmer, Alaska, to see Stuckey in person. Listening to Stuckey’s hit podcast, “Relatable,” in 2020 inspired her to serve on her local city council, she told RNS. Though she attended the conference alone, Graver said her fellow conferencegoers were an “extension” of her local faith community.\n“I don’t know them, but they’re still in the same family of Christians as I am,” said Graver.\nThe “Share the Arrows” conference was designed with women like Graver in mind. Stuckey, who is best known for her sharp political, cultural and theological commentary and who authored the 2024 book “Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion,” told RNS that the idea for the event was born in the wake of 2020, when many conservative women feared speaking their minds. Despite President Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, this year’s event wasn’t framed as a victory lap. The phrase “share the arrows” refers to the idea that when a conservative believer is attacked, likeminded Christians should rally around them. And Kirk’s assassination was cited repeatedly as evidence that conservative views remain under threat.\n“The pattern that we see of Christianity for the past 2,000 years, much to the disappointment of the tyrants that have tried to stop us, is that Christians tell the truth, Christians are persecuted, Christians multiply,” Stuckey said during the conference.\nThe values being targeted, according to the event speakers, include convictions about the dangers of “transgenderism” and queer identity, the belief that abortion is murder, and the upholding of traditional roles for men and women in marriage.\nSatan was frequently described as the one slinging the “arrows,” though it was often fellow Christians, rather than the secular left, who were accused of distorting what the conference framed as objective biblical truths. Alisa Childers, the former Christian musician turned author and apologist, condemned longtime NIH director and evangelical Francis Collins for supporting fetal tissue research, LGBTQ+ rights, DEI and “Darwinian evolution.” Childers then received laughter and applause for calling out evangelical author Jen Hatmaker, who is also LGBTQ-affirming.\n“We have groups of people that call themselves Christians, that will say, ‘Well, the Bible doesn’t really mean what we thought it meant for 2,000 years. Words don’t have objective meaning,’” Childers said during her talk.\nHillary Morgan Ferrer, founder of nonprofit Mama Bear Apologetics, described progressives not as enemies, but as captives.\n“We have to realize that people have ideological Stockholm Syndrome, especially when it comes to the whole alphabet brigade, because they think these ideas are the things that give me purpose. They give me acceptance,” Ferrer said, in reference to the LGBTQ+ acronym.\nChildren’s Rights nonprofit founder Katy Faust noted that it’s possible to love gay people without compromising conservative convictions but also framed same-sex marriage as a justice issue that deprives children of a mother or father. She rejected no-fault divorce, IVF and surrogacy, saying these practices prioritize parental preferences over the rights of children.\nThe talks took place on the main stage of the arena and were interspersed by worship sets that featured anthems like “In Christ Alone” and the more recent hit, “Holy Forever.” Twice, Christian musician Francesca Battistelli led attendees in the hymn “This Is My Father’s World” — which includes the line “the battle is not done.”\nBut while cultural battles were a throughline of the conference, there were lighthearted moments, too; speakers peppered their conversations with jokes about chicken coops and sourdough starters, and panels on motherhood and health dolled out practical advice on how to control children’s access to social media and avoid processed foods.\nUniting the speakers wasn’t just a conservative, evangelical worldview, but an aesthetic; all nine featured speakers were white women in their 30s-50s. Most attendees, too, were white women who seemed to embrace an unspoken uniform of jeans or long skirt and casual top, with hair worn down. The event’s sponsors — including a Texas-based, antibiotic-free meat company; a pro-life, chemical-free baby essentials brand; and a sustainable fashion brand — revealed a significant overlap with MAHA mothers (Make America Healthy Again) or, as Childers put it, moms of the “crunchy” variety.\nStuckey told RNS that “Share the Arrows” has a “pretty narrow” theology and politics, and that unlike other Christian women’s conferences “who dabble in the social and racial justice,” Stuckey has “zero tolerance” for that.\nDespite the specific conservative audience, “this is probably one of the biggest Christian women’s conferences out there, too, and it’s only our second year,” Stuckey observed. “I do think that tells us a little bit about where Christian women are headed.”\nIn the wake of Kirk’s passing, Stuckey has joined many conservative faith leaders in talking about the possibility of revival. In her speech, Childers hinted at Stuckey’s role in that movement, describing Stuckey as “exactly like a female Charlie Kirk” who had “rallied together 6,500 Charlie Kirks to come together.”\nStuckey, though, insisted that Kirk was an anomaly.\n“I and maybe 100 other people represent a sliver of what Charlie was,” Stuckey told RNS. “If I am part of the team that takes the baton of evangelizing and being an apologist for the faith in the conservative realm, I will be honored to take that.”",

In doing so, he is following in the footsteps of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who visited during the 2000 Jubilee, said Monsignor Flavio Pace, secretary of the Vatican’s office for promoting Christian unity.\nDuring the visit, Charles will be given a formal new title and recognition at a pontifical basilica that has strong, traditional ties to the Church of England, St. Paul’s Outside the Walls. The title “Royal Confrater,” is a sign of spiritual fellowship and will be given to Charles along with a special chair decorated with his coat of arms that will remain in the basilica for Charles and his heirs to use, officials said.\nAnglicans split from the Catholic Church in 1534 when English King Henry VIII was refused a marriage annulment. While popes for decades have forged warm relations with the Church of England and the broader Anglican Communion on a path toward greater unity, the two churches remain divided over issues such as the ordination of female priests, which the Catholic Church prohibits.\nSignificantly, the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, Sarah Mullally, will not join the king and queen since she hasn’t been formally installed as the Church of England’s spiritual leader. She is the first woman to hold the position, which is considered the first among equals in the broader Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members spread across 165 countries.\nIn her place, the archbishop of York will preside with Leo in the Sistine Chapel service, which will feature hymns sung by members of the royal choirs alongside the Sistine Chapel choir, Pace said.\nPace dodged a question about whether the Sistine Chapel service would have gone ahead as planned had Mullally been installed in time and joined the king and queen on the visit. He noted past joint statements of the Catholic and Anglican churches acknowledging their differences over women’s ordination but insisting that such obstacles shouldn’t prevent theological dialogue from continuing.\nCharles and Camilla’s trip was originally scheduled for April as part of a joint Vatican-Italy state visit. After Francis got sick, the king and queen went ahead with the planned four-day leg in Italy, and briefly greeted Francis at the Vatican just a few weeks before he died.\n———\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "body": "Dallin H. Oaks, former Utah Supreme Court justice, is selected to lead Mormon church\nDallin H. Oaks, former Utah Supreme Court justice, is selected to lead Mormon church\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice, was named Tuesday as the new president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its more than 17 million members worldwide.\nOaks’ selection to lead what is widely known as the Mormon church follows the recent death of his 101-year-old predecessor, Russell M. Nelson. His ascension is not a surprise; a longstanding church policy says the longest-tenured member of a top leadership body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the next president. The tradition is meant to ensure a seamless transition and prevent internal or public lobbying.\n“I accept with humility the responsibility that God has placed upon me and commit my whole heart and soul to the service to which I’ve been called,” Oaks said.\nAs president, he is considered a prophet and seer who will guide the church through divine revelation from God alongside two top counselors and members of the Quorum of the Twelve. He’ll set policy and oversee the church’s many business interests.\nThe church’s leadership transition comes as many of its members have been shaken by a deadly attack on a Michigan congregation, and are grappling with the high-profile assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, where the denomination is based.\nAt 93, Oaks will be one of the church’s oldest presidents. He will serve in the role until he dies. Tenures for past presidents have varied, with the longest reaching nearly 30 years and the shortest being just nine months.\nExperts are doubtful Oaks will pivot sharply from Nelson’s approach to leadership because he was one of Nelson’s closest advisers. But they say he might shift from Nelson’s focus on the faith’s global footprint to domestic issues.\nIn the first significant difference from Nelson’s presidency, Oaks announced during the faith’s recent general conference that the church will slow the announcement of new temples.\nFor his top counselors, Oaks selected Henry B. Eyring, 92, who also served in that role for Nelson, and former lawyer D. Todd Christofferson, 80, the church’s seventh most senior apostle.\nOaks’ choices demonstrate his “deliberate and methodical leadership style,” said Paul Reeve, Simmons Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Utah. While Christofferson was a somewhat unexpected choice, Reeve said it makes sense that the former Utah Supreme Court justice known for his jurist sensibilities would pick a former lawyer.\n“I confess that this is not what I expected when I woke up this morning,” Christofferson said during Tuesday’s announcement. “But I am deeply honored by this calling and the trust that it carries.”\nWhile serving on a lower leadership panel in the 1990s, Christofferson was involved in negotiations with Jewish leaders regarding the church’s posthumous baptisms of Holocaust victims. In 1994, following intense criticism from the Jewish community, the church agreed to end those ceremonial baptisms. After it was revealed that they continued, church leaders reiterated in 2012 that the practice was not allowed.\nJeffrey R. Holland, 84, the most senior apostle after Oaks — and thus next in line to be president — was not selected as a counselor but will lead the Quorum of the Twelve. “The concern there is declining health,” Reeve explained.\nOaks is also known for his traditionalist beliefs on marriage and religious freedom. He has been a driving force in the church against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin — a position that causes uneasiness among some LGBTQ+ members and their allies.\nHe said in 2022 that social and legal pressure would not influence the church to change its posture on same-sex marriage and matters of gender identity.\nIn recent years, Oaks has been part of some key church moves that suggest he might not make the topic a centerpiece of his administration, experts say. Oaks was Nelson’s closest adviser in 2019 when Nelson rescinded a policy that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled same-sex couples as sinners eligible for expulsion.\nChristofferson, who has a gay brother, was the apostle who church leaders put forward to explain and justify the ban back in 2015. At the time, his brother had recently rejoined the church after ending a lengthy relationship with his same-sex partner.\nOaks has also been a strong advocate for civil public discourse. Early on as an apostle, he was involved in a crackdown on far-right extremism that resulted in some excommunications. In 2020, he gave a speech about having faith in elections without resorting to radicalism or violence.",

La Casa Blanca no respondió a una solicitud de comentarios.\nEn un evento televisado el jueves, Maduro ridiculizó los informes de que Rodríguez formaría parte de un plan para reemplazarlo, calificándolos de intento de “dividir a nuestro pueblo”.\nSe mofó también de la confirmación de Trump de que el presidente estadounidense había autorizado a la CIA a operar en Venezuela.\n“¿Alguien se puede creer que la CIA no está operando en Venezuela desde hace 60 años?”, preguntó Maduro.\nRodríguez dijo que el supuesto plan para que Maduro renuncie es una noticia falsa.\n\"¡Falso!”, escribió Rodríguez en inglés en su cuenta de Telegram. “Más medios que se suman al basurero de la guerra psicológica contra el pueblo venezolano”.\nSeñaló también que el liderazgo de Venezuela está unido.\nDesde septiembre, las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos han implementado una serie de ataques contra presuntas embarcaciones de contrabando de drogas en el mar Caribe, incluidos al menos cuatro botes que partieron de Venezuela.\nEsos ataques siguieron al despliegue por parte de Trump de tres destructores de misiles Aegis teledirigidos en aguas frente a Venezuela, parte de lo que el gobierno dice es un empeño para combatir las amenazas de los cárteles de drogas latinoamericanos.\n“Operaciones psicológicas” en juego mientras la Casa Blanca intenta “crear una fractura” en Venezuela: experto\nTrump dio el paso poco ortodoxo el miércoles de confirmarles a los periodistas que había autorizado acciones encubiertas de la CIA en Venezuela, y agregó que el gobierno “está sopesando nuevas operaciones terrestres” mientras evalúa efectuar más ataques en la región. Pero se negó a decir si la CIA tiene autoridad para tomar medidas específicas contra Maduro.\nEl reconocimiento por parte del presidente republicano de que había dado luz verde a la acción de la agencia de inteligencia agudizó aún más las tensiones con la nación sudamericana, ya de por sí elevadas debido a los ataques a las embarcaciones.\nEs improbable hallar en un manual de espionaje que un comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos aborde públicamente operaciones encubiertas de la CIA. Pero algunos analistas dicen que puede haber provocado un efecto deseado para la Casa Blanca: crear aún más inquietud entre Maduro y sus aliados de que sus días podrían estar contados.\n“Son operaciones psicológicas”, apuntó Brian Fonseca, un académico de la Universidad Internacional de Florida que estudia el caso de Venezuela. “Esto consiste en presionar al régimen de Maduro e intentar crear una fractura entre la élite política y militar del país, y ver si luego se puede lograr que esa fractura desplace a Maduro del poder.”\nMaduro prestó juramento en enero para un tercer mandato de seis años a pesar de evidencia creíble de que perdió las elecciones del año pasado.\nTom Cotton, presidente de la Comisión de Inteligencia del Senado, puso de relieve que la oposición de Estados Unidos al gobierno de Maduro no es nueva, pero se negó a comentar sobre la declaración de Trump de que él ha aprobado operaciones encubiertas de la CIA en Venezuela.\n“Sin embargo, fue, y es, la política de los gobiernos de Trump y de Biden que Maduro no es el líder legítimo de Venezuela”, señaló Cotton en un comunicado.\nLa campaña de presión de Trump sobre Venezuela probablemente está diseñada para alentar a los líderes militares del país sudamericano a retirar su apoyo a Maduro, dejándolo con pocos aliados y pocas opciones salvo renunciar, expresó Vanda Felbab-Brown, investigadora sénior en la Brookings Institution —un centro de investigación de izquierda— y experta en tráfico de drogas y temas de seguridad.\nEsa es probablemente una de las razones por las que Trump dio el paso de anunciar públicamente la participación de la CIA, agregó.\n“Es cada vez más claro que el propósito de estas acciones en el Caribe es derribar el régimen de Maduro”, observó Felbab-Brown. “El gobierno está tratando de crear suficiente presión sobre las fuerzas armadas para que abandonen a Maduro”.\nUn pequeño grupo de altos funcionarios del gobierno —incluidos el secretario de Estado Marco Rubio, el subsecretario de Estado Christopher Landau, y Stephen Miller, asesor de Trump— han impulsado la realización de los ataques.\nDesde que era senador, Rubio ha abogado por adoptar una línea más dura contra Maduro.\nDurante el primer mandato de Trump, Maduro fue acusado formalmente de cargos federales de drogas en Estados Unidos, incluidos narcoterrorismo y asociación delictuosa para importar cocaína. Este año, el Departamento de Justicia duplicó a 50 millones de dólares una recompensa por información que conduzca al arresto de Maduro, acusándolo de ser “uno de los mayores narcotraficantes del mundo”.\nTrump ha centrado su atención en la pandilla venezolana Tren de Aragua, que dice está sirviendo como una “fachada” para Maduro, y dijo que había miembros de esa agrupación delictiva en el primer bote atacado el mes pasado. No se han publicado detalles sobre las supuestas afiliaciones en los otros ataques.\n____\nLos periodistas de la AP Farnoush Amiri en Naciones Unidas, Jorge Rueda en Caracas, y Lisa Mascaro en Washington contribuyeron a este despacho.\n____\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.",

    "body": "Defensa en el “juicio del siglo” en el Vaticano pide recusación del fiscal por conducta cuestionable\nCIUDAD DEL VATICANO (AP) — Los abogados defensores en el “juicio del siglo” de la Santa Sede pidieron el lunes al fiscal del Vaticano que se recusara del juicio de apelación, argumentando que estaba implicado en un comportamiento cuestionable según cientos de mensajes privados de WhatsApp que han sacudido el proceso.\nEl fiscal Alessandro Diddi tiene un conflicto de intereses que debería impedirle encabezar la acusación, dijeron los abogados en mociones separadas el día de apertura del juicio de apelación.\nEl presidente del tribunal, el arzobispo Alejandro Arellano Cedillo, aceptó las mociones y ordenó a Diddi responder en un plazo de tres días, subrayando cómo los chats han cambiado el terreno en la más ambiciosa y destacada acusación del Vaticano por presuntos delitos financieros.\nEn el juicio sobre la inversión de 350 millones de euros (412 millones de dólares) del Vaticano en una propiedad en Londres fueron condenadas nueve personas en 2023 por una serie de cargos relacionados con finanzas. El principal acusado fue el cardenal Angelo Becciu, que alguna vez fue un cercano confidente del papa Francisco y futuro candidato al papado. Cayó en desgracia después de que el difunto papa lo despidiera y le acusara de falta de ética financiera antes de ser imputado.\nLa investigación dio un giro crucial en agosto de 2020, cuando el principal sospechoso en el acuerdo de Londres, monseñor Alberto Perlasca, cambió su versión y se volvió contra su antiguo jefe, Becciu. Perlasca evitó ser imputado y se convirtió en un testigo clave de la fiscalía.\nRecientemente, miles de páginas de textos de WhatsApp y mensajes de audio proporcionaron el trasfondo del cambio de posición de Perlasca. Sugieren una conducta cuestionable por parte de la policía del Vaticano, de Diddi y del propio Francisco.\nEn ellos se documenta un esfuerzo tras bambalinas por parte de dos mujeres, Francesca Chaouqui y Genevieve Ciferri, para señalar al cardenal persuadiendo a Perlasca para que se volviera contra él. Aunque las afirmaciones no están verificadas, la defensa las ha aprovechado como evidencia de que la investigación estaba contaminada desde el principio y de que los acusados no podían tener un juicio justo en el Vaticano, una monarquía absoluta donde Francisco intervino en favor de los fiscales.\nLa existencia de los mensajes sacudió por primera vez el juicio en 2022 cuando Diddi le dijo al tribunal que Ciferri le había enviado 126 conversaciones que sostuvo con Chaouqui. El fiscal presentó los mensajes como evidencia, pero redactó todos menos ocho, lo que provocó que la defensa afirmara que estaba ocultando pruebas cruciales.\nDespués de que se dictaron las sentencias, Ciferri entregó todos los chats, además de miles de conversaciones sostenidas durante cuatro años, a los abogados de otro acusado, las cuales han seguido circulando.\nEl contenido adicional muestra que Diddi sostuvo más de 126 chats en 2022 y que Ciferri siguió enviándole contenido durante cuatro días. El fiscal dijo que la bloqueó después de la primera noche. Los chats adicionales sugieren que Diddi tuvo “contactos irregulares” con Perlasca, afirmó la defensa.\nLos abogados defensores también mencionaron un archivo de audio que sugiere que el comisionado de policía del Vaticano, Stefano De Santis, dio consejos a Chaouqui para Perlasca sobre cómo implicar a otros cuando aún era uno de los sospechosos. Cuando Perlasca cambió su versión, no solo evitó ser imputado, sino que fue listado como parte perjudicada en el juicio y se convirtió en fiscal en otro tribunal del Vaticano.\n“Aún no sabemos si lo que surge de los chats y grabaciones de audio es cierto, pero es seguro que parecen revelar —excepto por posibles fanfarronadas, que deben ser verificadas— una inquietante implicación directa o indirecta de los investigadores” en el condicionamiento del testimonio de Perlasca, escribieron los abogados de los cuatro principales acusados en una moción donde exigen que Diddi se recuse.\nDurante la audiencia del lunes, en una sala decorada con frescos en el Palacio Apostólico, Diddi agradeció a la defensa por darle la oportunidad de responder a las acusaciones y dijo que tomaría los tres días para “expresar mis pensamientos con calma, con el fin de disipar las dudas que han surgido en los últimos meses sobre la realización de la investigación.”\nLuego abandonó el tribunal y otros fiscales tomaron el relevo.\nSi Diddi no se recusa, el asunto pasará al Tribunal de Casación del Vaticano encabezado por el cardenal estadounidense Kevin Farrell, un protegido de Francisco y designado por el difunto papa.\nEn su papel como camarlengo, Farrell supuestamente mostró una carta de Francisco tras la muerte del pontífice donde dejaba claro que no quería que Becciu participara en el cónclave para elegir a su sucesor.\n___\nLa cobertura de temas religiosos de The Associated Press recibe apoyo a través de la colaboración de la AP con The Conversation US, con financiación de Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "body": "Marcha de Generación Z contra nuevo presidente de Perú deja un fallecido y más de 100 heridos\nLIMA (AP) — Miles de jóvenes peruanos marcharon el miércoles para exigir la renuncia del presidente interino, José Jerí, y de los legisladores, además de la derogación de leyes que, según creen, favorecen la delincuencia. Casi a medianoche, las autoridades reportaron la muerte de un civil y al menos 100 heridos, la mayoría de ellos policías.\nLos manifestantes, entre los que había organizaciones autodenominadas Generación Z, quemaron frente al Congreso un violín gigante de cartón cubierto por una banda presidencial y lanzaron fuegos artificiales a la policía, que respondió con gases lacrimógenos y perdigones, según presenció The Associated Press.\nAunque la Generación Z se corresponde con menores de 30 años, las protestas en Perú incluyen también a sindicalistas y familiares de civiles muertos en las manifestaciones de 2022 y 2023.\nLa Defensoría del Pueblo confirmó que el cantante de hip hop Eduardo Ruíz, de 32 años, llegó muerto a un hospital de Lima con una herida de bala, mientras que 24 manifestantes más sufrieron contusiones. El ministro del Interior, Vicente Tiburcio, indicó que había 80 policías heridos. Seis periodistas recibieron el impacto de perdigones y otros cuatro fueron agredidos por la policía, según la Asociación Nacional de Periodistas.\nLa víspera, Jerí nombró primer ministro a Ernesto Álvarez, un exjuez ultraconservador activo en redes sociales que cerró sus cuentas en X e Instagram antes de juramentar. Álvarez dijo que la Generación Z peruana es una “banda que quiere tomar por asalto la democracia” y que no representa a la juventud que estudia y trabaja.\nEl primer ministro también afirmó que esta generación es “heredera” del Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru, un grupo peruano al que Estados Unidos calificó como terrorista hasta 2001. Además, apuntó que “la violencia en la protesta es reprimible para restablecer el orden”.\nEl presidente lamentó la muerte del manifestante. Álvarez no se ha pronunciado al respecto.\nAlgunos manifestantes llevaban banderas negras con un símbolo del anime japonés “One Piece” —una calavera pirata con un sombrero de paja—, como ocurrió en protestas similares contra los gobiernos de Nepal, Madagascar, Filipinas, Indonesia y Marruecos.\nEn una plaza de Lima donde suelen celebrarse protestas, el electricista David Tafur, de 27 años, cubría su espalda con la bandera negra. “El caso mío es la indignación por el abuso de autoridad, la corrupción, las muertes”, manifestó, y recordó cómo las cifras de asesinatos subieron de 676 casos en 2017 hasta 2.082 en 2024.\nTafur dijo que decidió acudir a la manifestación luego de enterarse de la convocatoria en TikTok, y señaló que sintió cautivado por la historia del pirata Monkey D. Luffy, un personaje del anime japonés que se enfrenta a gobiernos corruptos.\n“Luchamos por lo mismo, contra los corruptos, que además aquí son asesinos”, declaró recordando que el gobierno de la expresidenta Dina Boluarte se mantuvo en el poder desde diciembre de 2022 pese a más de 500 protestas en su contra y 50 manifestantes muertos.\nBoluarte fue destituida el viernes luego que los principales partidos en el Congreso le retiraron el apoyo a falta de medio año para las elecciones generales, en las que se elegirá a 130 diputados, 60 senadores y un nuevo presidente. Jerí, un legislador de 38 años, la reemplazó de forma interina.\nEn la misma plaza limeña, otros levantaban carteles que decían “Protestar es un derecho, asesinar es un delito”. Una mujer llevaba un letrero con la frase “De una asesina a un violador, la misma porquería” para criticar el cambio de gobierno.\nJerí era el presidente del Congreso y había llegado al puesto luego de un acuerdo entre los principales partidos, que apoyaron a Boluarte durante todo su gobierno. Por ese motivo, varios expertos lo consideran una continuación del gobierno de la expresidenta.\nPero las críticas contra Jerí se han incrementado también porque enfrentó una investigación por presunta violación tras ser denunciado por una mujer. La fiscalía archivó la pesquisa en agosto, pero continúa para otro hombre que acompañaba a Jerí el día en que habrían ocurrido los hechos. En la protesta, más de 20 mujeres vestidas con camisetas blancas y faldas rojas gritaban “El violador es Jerí” o “Jerí es violín”, en referencia a una jerga en la que violín significa violador.\nLos manifestantes también criticaron que, mientras fue legislador, Jerí votó a favor de al menos seis leyes que, según sostienen, debilitan la persecución de la delincuencia. Esas normas eliminan la detención preliminar en casos sin flagrancia, impiden procesar a partidos políticos como grupos criminales, elevan los requisitos para confiscar bienes a grupos delictivos y dificultan la colaboración eficaz y los allanamientos.\nEn la ciudad de Juliaca, Judith Cruz, una estudiante de 23 años, dijo a reporteros que marchaba por todos los jóvenes.\n“Defendemos tus derechos para que no te amenacen cuando quieras tener un emprendimiento”, indicó llamando la atención sobre el repunte en las extorsiones, que aumentaron de 2.305 en 2020 hasta 21.746 en 2024, según la fiscalía.\n“También queremos que dejen de criminalizar las protestas”, añadió Cruz.\nLas manifestaciones de la Generación Z de Perú empezaron hace un mes y se caracterizaron por celebrarse los fines de semana. En un principio pretendían cambios en la ley de pensiones, que obligaba a los más jóvenes a realizar aportaciones, lo cual reducía aún más sus escasos ingresos.\nFinalmente, el Congreso anuló los aportes obligatorios para los jóvenes.\n“Luego del tema de las pensiones llegaron varios malestares detrás, que tienen que ver con la inseguridad, con cómo se ha ido destrozando la capacidad estatal en el Perú y con la corrupción”, apuntó Omar Coronel, profesor de sociología de la Pontificia Universidad Católica de Perú, que estudia las protestas.\nCoronel indicó que los jóvenes de la Generación Z en Perú no están ideologizados, suelen informarse en las redes sociales, y rechazan profundamente a las élites autoritarias.",

    "body": "¿Guerra contra la droga o el terrorismo? Presión militar de Trump sobre Venezuela difumina límites\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Con el presidente Donald Trump, la guerra contra las drogas se asemeja mucho a la guerra contra el terrorismo.\nPara justificar los ataques contra pandillas y cárteles del narcotráfico latinoamericanos, el gobierno de Trump se basa en un argumento jurídico que ganó fuerza después de los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, lo que permitió a las autoridades estadounidense usar fuerza letal contra combatientes de Al Qaeda que atacaron el World Trade Center y el Pentágono.\nPero los grupos que son objeto ahora de los ataques de Estados Unidos son un enemigo muy diferente, surgido en las prisiones de Venezuela y alimentado no por una ideología antioccidental, sino por el tráfico de drogas y otras actividades ilícitas.\nEl uso que hace Trump de una fuerza militar aplastante para combatir a esos grupos y la autorización de acciones encubiertas dentro de Venezuela —posiblemente para derrocar a su presidente, Nicolás Maduro— traspasa los límites del derecho internacional, según los expertos legales. Y todo esto ocurre mientras Trump amplía el papel del ejército en el ámbito nacional: desplegó a la Guardia Nacional en varias ciudades y afirmó que está abierto a invocar la Ley de Insurrección, de hace casi 150 años, que permite el despliegue militar solo en casos excepcionales de disturbios civiles.\nPor el momento, el ejército mató al menos a 27 personas en cinco ataques a barcos que, según la Casa Blanca, transportaban drogas.\nEstas operaciones —la más reciente fue el martes y dejó seis fallecidos— se han llevado a cabo sin ninguna investigación legal ni la tradicional declaración de guerra del Congreso. Esto plantea preguntas acerca de la justificación de las acciones de Trump y el impacto que podrían tener en las relaciones diplomáticas con las naciones latinoamericanas que recuerdan con profundo resentimiento las repetidas intervenciones militares de Estados Unidos durante la Guerra Fría.\nLa comunidad de inteligencia estadounidense también ha cuestionado la afirmación central de Trump de que el gobierno de Maduro está colaborando con la pandilla Tren de Aragua y orquestando el tráfico de drogas y la inmigración ilegal hacia Estados Unidos.\n“No se puede llamar a algo guerra”\nLa afirmación de Trump de que Estados Unidos está inmerso en un “conflicto armado” con los cárteles de la drogas se basa en la misma autoridad legal utilizada por el gobierno de George W. Bush cuando declaró la guerra al terrorismo después del 11-S. Incluye la capacidad de capturar y detener a combatientes y usar la fuerza letal para eliminar a sus líderes.\nPero la carta de Naciones Unidas prohíbe específicamente el uso de la fuerza, salvo en casos de defensa propia.\n“No se puede simplemente llamar a algo guerra para darte poderes bélicos”, dijo Claire Finkelstein, profesora de Derecho de Seguridad Nacional en la Universidad de Pensilvania. “Por muy frustrados que estemos con los medios y los resultados de los esfuerzos de las fuerzas del orden para combatir el flujo de drogas, es una burla del derecho internacional sugerir que estamos en un conflicto armado no internacional con los cárteles”.\nDespués del 11 de septiembre, estaba claro que Al Qaeda estaba planeando de forma activa ataques adicionales para causar bajas civiles. Pero la principal ambición de los cárteles es vender drogas. Y eso, aunque es perjudicial para la seguridad estadounidense en general, es una justificación dudosa para invocar los poderes bélicos, apuntó Geoffrey Corn, profesor de Derecho en la Universidad Tecnológica de Texas, que en el pasado fue asesor principal del ejército para asuntos de derecho de guerra.\n“En mi humilde opinión, el gobierno quiere invocar los poderes bélicos por muchas razones”, incluidas las políticas, añadió Corn.\n“Incluso si asumimos que hay un conflicto armado con el Tren de Aragua, ¿cómo sabemos que todos en ese barco eran combatientes enemigos?”, manifestó. “Creo que el Congreso debe saberlo”.\nTrump defiende los ataques\nPreguntado en la Casa Blanca el miércoles por qué Estados Unidos no utiliza a la Guardia Costera para detener los barcos venezolanos y confiscar la droga, Trump respondió: “Hemos estado haciendo eso durante 30 años y ha sido totalmente ineficaz.”\nEl presidente también además que Estados Unidos podría atacar objetivos dentro de Venezuela, una maniobra que aumentaría significativamente las tensiones y las implicaciones legales. Hasta ahora, los ataques se han producido en aguas internacionales más allá de la jurisdicción de cualquier nación.\n“Lo hemos detenido casi por completo por mar”, dijo Trump acerca del flujo de drogas. “Ahora lo detendremos por tierra.”\nAl mandatario se le preguntó también por un reporte del New York Times que afirmó que había autorizado una operación encubierta de la CIA en Venezuela. Trump, quien ha criticado con dureza la invasión estadounidense de Irak que derrocó al gobierno de Saddam Hussein en 2003, se negó a decir si había dado a la CIA la autoridad para eliminar a Maduro, alegando que sería “ridículo” responder.\nNumerosas leyes y órdenes ejecutivas estadounidenses desde la década de 1970 consideran ilegal asesinar a funcionarios extranjeros. Pero al declarar a los venezolanos combatientes ilegales, Trump podría estar buscando eludir esas restricciones y regresar a una época anterior en la que, en lugares como Guatemala, Chile e Irán, Washington llevaba a cabo regularmente misiones encubiertas para propiciar un cambio de régimen.\n“Si representas una amenaza y estás en guerra con Estados Unidos, no eres una persona protegida”, señaló Finkelstein.\nDurante el primer mandato de Trump, Maduro fue acusado de delitos federales relacionados con las drogas en Estados Unidos, incluidos narcoterrorismo y conspiración para importar cocaína. Este año, el Departamento de Justicia duplicó la recompensa por información que conduzca al arresto del mandatario a 50 millones de dólares, acusándolo de ser “uno de los mayores narcotraficantes del mundo.”\nPero el enfoque de Trump sobre Venezuela pasa por alto un aspecto básico del tráfico de drogas: la mayoría de las muertes por sobredosis en Estados Unidos son por fentanilo, que llega por tierra desde México. Y aunque Venezuela es una importante zona de tránsito de drogas, alrededor del 75% de la cocaína producida en Colombia —el líder mundial— se trafica a través del océano Pacífico oriental, no el Caribe.\nCongreso y CPI quedan al margen\nSegún la Constitución, debe ser el Congreso quien declare la guerra. Por el momento, sin embargo, hay pocos indicios de que los aliados de Trump vayan a oponerse a la visión expansionista del presidente sobre sus propias competencias para perseguir a los cárteles a los que la Casa Blanca culpa de las decenas de miles de muertes por sobredosis que se registran en el país cada año.\nEl Senado, controlado por el Partido Republicano, rechazó recientemente una resolución sobre los poderes bélicos presentada por los demócratas que habría obligado al presidente a solicitar la autorización del Congreso para nuevos ataques militares.\nA pesar de la presión, incluso entre algunos republicanos, para que se ofrezca una explicación más completa, el gobierno de Trump no ha proporcionado aún a los legisladores pruebas que demuestren que las embarcaciones atacadas por el ejército transportaban narcóticos, dijeron a The Associated Press dos funcionarios estadounidenses familiarizados con el asunto. El senador independiente Angus King, de Maine, indicó que, durante una sesión informativa clasificada este mes, a él y a otros miembros del Comité de Servicios Armados del Senado se les negó el acceso a la opinión legal del Pentágono sobre si los ataques se ajustaban a la legislación estadounidense.\nTampoco es probable que la oposición legal influya en la Casa Blanca. Una decisión de la Corte Suprema a raíz del intento de una congresista demócrata de demandar al Pentágono en 1973 para frenar la expansión de la Guerra de Vietnam a los vecinos Laos y Camboya estableció un estándar muy alto para cualquier recurso legal a las órdenes militares, afirmó Finkelstein.\nLos familiares de los venezolanos muertos en los ataques enfrentan sus propios desafíos legales después de que varios fallos de la Corte Suprema limitaron el alcance de los ciudadanos extranjeros para demandar en Estados Unidos.\nLos ataques militares ocurrieron en aguas internacionales, lo que permitiría a la Corte Penal Internacional iniciar una investigación similar a sus pesquisas por presuntos crímenes de guerra contra Rusia e Israel, que, como ocurre con Washington, no reconocen la autoridad del tribunal.\nPero la corte con sede en La Haya se ha visto envuelta en una investigación por conducta sexual inapropiada que obligó a su fiscal jefe a dar un paso atrás. Las sanciones de Estados Unidos por su acusación contra el primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, también han obstaculizado su trabajo.\n___\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.",

    "body": "Hamás reafirma compromiso con alto el fuego mientras demora en entrega de cadáveres tensa los ánimos\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Franja de Gaza (AP) — Hamás usó excavadoras el viernes para buscar los restos de los rehenes fallecidos mientras trataba de consolidar su frágil acuerdo de alto el fuego con Israel, reafirmando su compromiso con los términos del pacto, que incluye la entrega de los cuerpos.\nEl comunicado del grupo insurgente siguió a la advertencia del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, de que daría luz verde a Israel para reanudar la guerra si Hamás no cumple su parte del acuerdo y devuelve todos los cadáveres de los rehenes, que suman 28. Hasta ahora, ha entregado los restos de nueve, junto con un décimo cuerpo que, según Israel, no pertenecía a un rehén.\nEn su comunicado, Hamás afirmó que algunos restos de los rehenes estaban en túneles o edificios que luego fueron destruidos por Israel, y se necesita maquinaria pesada para excavar entre los escombros y recuperarlos. El grupo armado culpa a Israel por el retraso, diciendo que no ha permitido la entrada de nuevas excavadoras en la Franja de Gaza.\nLa mayoría del equipo pesado en Gaza fue destruido durante la guerra, dejando solo una cantidad limitada mientras los palestinos intentan limpiar grandes cantidades de escombros en todo el territorio.\nEl viernes, dos excavadoras removían la tierra mientras Hamás buscaba los restos de los rehenes en Ciudad Hamad, un complejo de torres de apartamentos en la ciudad de Jan Yunis. Las fuerzas israelíes bombardearon repetidamente las torres durante la guerra, derribando algunas, y los soldados llevaron a cabo una incursión de una semana en el sitio en marzo de 2024 para combatir a los milicianos.\nHamás instó a los mediadores a aumentar el flujo de ayuda a Gaza, acelerar la apertura del cruce fronterizo de Rafah con Egipto y comenzar la reconstrucción. También pidió que se “inicie de inmediato” el establecimiento de un comité de independientes palestinos que administrará la Franja de Gaza y que las tropas israelíes continúen retirándose de las áreas acordadas.\nEl plan de alto el fuego presentado por Trump exigía que todos los rehenes, vivos o muertos, fueran devueltos antes de un plazo que expiró el lunes. Pero según el acuerdo, si eso no sucedía, Hamás debía compartir información sobre los rehenes fallecidos e intentar entregarlos lo antes posible.\nEl primer ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, señaló que Israel “no cederá” y exigió que los insurgentes cumplan lo establecido en el acuerdo sobre la devolución de los cuerpos de los rehenes.\nObstáculos para recuperar los cadáveres\nHamás ha garantizado a Washington, a través de intermediarios, que trabaja para devolver los restos mortales de los rehenes fallecidos. Funcionarios estadounidenses afirman que la recuperación de los cuerpos se ve obstaculizada por la magnitud de la devastación, además de por la presencia de artefactos explosivos sin detonar.\nEl grupo insurgente comunicó también a los mediadores que algunos de los cadáveres están en zonas controladas por las tropas israelíes.\nEn una conferencia de prensa con su homólogo alemán en Ankara, el ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Turquía, Hakan Fidan, expresó su preocupación de que Israel pueda usar la “falta de equipo” de Hamás para recuperar los cuerpos como pretexto para reanudar las hostilidades.\nHamás liberó a los 20 rehenes israelíes vivos el lunes. A cambio, Israel sacó de la cárcel a alrededor de 2.000 prisioneros y detenidos palestinos.\nEn Israel, el Foro de Familias de Rehenes y Desaparecidos, que agrupa a muchas familias de secuestrados, dijo que continuarán realizando manifestaciones semanales hasta que todos los restos sean devueltos.\nIsrael ha devuelto también a Gaza los cadáveres de 90 palestinos para su entierro. Se espera que entregue más cuerpos, aunque las autoridades no han revelado cuántos tiene bajo custodia o cuántos devolverá.\nUn equipo forense palestino que examina los restos apuntó que algunos mostraban signos de malos tratos.\nLa campaña de Israel en Gaza ha provocado la muerte de casi 68.000 palestinos, según el Ministerio de Salud, que forma parte del gobierno dirigido por Hamás en el territorio. El organismo mantiene registros detallados de bajas que son considerados generalmente confiables por agencias de la ONU y expertos independientes. Según la Cruz Roja, hay miles de personas desaparecidas.\nEn el ataque del 7 de octubre de 2023 a Israel, los combatientes mataron a alrededor de 1.200 personas y tomaron a unas 250 como rehenes.\nFrancia dice que se prepara una fuerza internacional para Gaza\nFrancia dijo que trabaja con sus “socios británicos y estadounidenses” para proponer una resolución ante Naciones Unidas en los próximos días que proporcione un marco para la fuerza internacional para Gaza.\nEl vocero del Ministerio de Exteriores francés, Pascal Confavreux, dijo el jueves en una conferencia de prensa que los países árabes desean un mandato de la ONU para la fuerza. Se espera que los países árabes aporten tropas a dicha fuerza, que supervisará a la policía palestina entrenada por Egipto.\nConfavreux dijo que aún se deben resolver los detalles sobre el financiamiento, el equipo y qué países participarán.\nEn alusión a la posible fuerza de estabilización, Fidan dijo que “nuestro objetivo es crear un entorno de zona de amortiguamiento donde cada bando ya no pueda dañarse mutuamente”.\nSigue la espera de una gran entrada de ayuda\nLa ONU dijo que la ayuda humanitaria que llega al territorio sigue siendo limitada debido a los continuos cierres de los cruces y a las restricciones impuestas a los grupos de ayuda.\nEl panel de control de Naciones Unidas que supervisa el movimiento de camiones hacia Gaza muestra que 339 han ingresado al territorio y fueron descargados para su distribución desde que comenzó el alto el fuego el 10 de octubre. Según el acuerdo, se permitiría la entrada de 600 camiones de ayuda a Gaza diariamente.\nCOGAT, el organismo de defensa israelí que supervisa la ayuda humanitaria en Gaza, informó que 950 camiones cruzaron el jueves y 716 el miércoles, dijo Jens Laerke, portavoz de la agencia de coordinación de ayuda humanitaria de la ONU. Los cruces estuvieron cerrados el lunes y el martes para el intercambio de rehenes y prisioneros y por una festividad judía.\nLaerke dijo que las cifras de COGAT incluyen camiones comerciales y entregas bilaterales.\nNahed Sheheiber, el jefe del sindicato de conductores de camiones de Gaza, que organiza las recogidas de ayuda desde el lado gazatí de la frontera después de la inspección israelí, señaló que la seguridad ha mejorado, lo que ha evitado saqueos o que las bandas intercepten los convoyes, incluso si no ha habido un aumento significativo en los suministros que llegan al territorio desde el alto el fuego. Dijo que solo 70 camiones entraron el jueves.\nMás de 2 millones de personas en Gaza esperan que el alto el fuego les proporcione un alivio del desastre humanitario causado por la campaña de Israel. Durante la guerra, Tel Aviv restringió la entrada de ayuda a Gaza, a veces dejando entrar solo cantidades mínimas, y prohibió completamente la entrada de alimentos durante dos meses a principios de este año para presionar a Hamás a liberar a los rehenes.\nSe declaró una situación de hambruna en la Ciudad de Gaza, y la ONU dice que ha verificado la muerte de más de 400 personas por causas relacionadas con la desnutrición, incluidos más de 100 niños.\nIsrael dice que dejó entrar suficientes alimentos y acusó a Hamás de robar gran parte de ellos. La ONU y otras agencias de ayuda niegan esa afirmación.\n___\nLa periodista de The Associated Press Angela Charlton en París contribuyó a este despacho.\n___\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.",

    "body": "EEUU ha apresado a sobrevivientes de ataque contra lancha en el Caribe, dicen fuentes AP\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Estados Unidos aprehendió a sobrevivientes de un ataque militar estadounidense contra una embarcación que presuntamente transportaba drogas en el Caribe, dijeron el viernes un funcionario de defensa y otra persona familiarizada con el asunto.\nEs el primer ataque del ejército estadounidense contra lanchas en el Caribe del que se sabe que alguien escapa con vida desde que el gobierno del presidente Donald Trump comenzó a atacar embarcaciones pequeñas en las aguas frente a Venezuela el mes pasado, y plantea preguntas sobre cómo Estados Unidos tratará a los sobrevivientes.\nTrump confirmó posteriormente el ataque durante un evento en la Casa Blanca. “Atacamos un submarino, y era un submarino que transportaba drogas construido específicamente para el transporte de grandes cantidades de drogas”, aseveró.\nEl secretario de Estado estadounidense, Marco Rubio, no negó que hubo sobrevivientes, pero dijo repetidamente que los detalles se darán a conocer después.\nEl ataque del jueves, al menos el sexto desde principios de septiembre, eleva a por lo menos 28 el número de muertos por las acciones militares de Estados Unidos contra botes en la región.\nEs el primero en el que hay sobrevivientes que fueron recogidos por el ejército estadounidense. Hasta el momento, se ignora qué se hará con ellos. Según el funcionario de defensa, están retenidos en un buque de la Marina estadounidense.\nEl funcionario y otra persona confirmaron el ataque y la detención de los sobrevivientes bajo la condición de anonimato porque aún no ha sido reconocido públicamente por el gobierno de Trump.\nTrump ha justificado los ataques militares contra lanchas en el Caribe con el argumento que Estados Unidos se encuentra en un “conflicto armado” con los cárteles de la droga, la misma autoridad legal utilizada por el gobierno de Bush cuando declaró la guerra al terrorismo después de los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001. Tal autoridad incluye capturar y detener combatientes y usar fuerza letal para eliminar a sus líderes.\nAlgunos expertos en leyes han cuestionado la legalidad de tal estrategia. El uso de fuerza militar abrumadora por parte de Estados Unidos para combatir a los cárteles, junto con la autorización que ha dado Trump a su gobierno para emprender acciones encubiertas dentro de Venezuela, posiblemente para derrocar al presidente Nicolás Maduro, pone a prueba los límites del derecho internacional, según los juristas.\nEl presidente colombiano, Gustavo Petro, ha sido uno de los más críticos de la región en cuanto a los ataques, y el viernes volvió a plantear la posibilidad de que entre las embarcaciones atacadas hubiesen a bordo colombianos, sin mostrar pruebas. Pidió estar alerta sobre el paradero de dos jóvenes de una ciudad del Caribe colombiano que no han sido localizados e indicó que, de comprobarse su hipótesis, está dispuesto a denunciar a funcionarios estadounidenses para que sean juzgados en Colombia.\nEl viernes, Trump pareció confirmar reportes de que Maduro ha ofrecido una participación en el petróleo y otros recursos minerales de Venezuela en los últimos meses con la intención de contrarrestar la creciente presión de Estados Unidos. La semana pasada, el diario New York Times fue el primer medio en reportar esa intención del gobierno de Maduro.\nFuncionarios del gobierno venezolano también han planteado un plan según el cual Maduro eventualmente dejará el cargo, de acuerdo con un exfuncionario del gobierno de Trump. Ese plan también fue rechazado por la Casa Blanca, según un reporte de la AP.\n“Lo ha ofrecido todo”, aseveró Trump a periodistas al comienzo de una reunión con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"¿Saben por qué? Porque no quiere meterse con Estados Unidos”.\nPara los sobrevivientes del ataque del jueves, la saga está lejos de terminar. Ahora enfrentan un futuro y un panorama legal inciertos, incluyendo cuestionamientos sobre si se les considera prisioneros de guerra o acusados en un caso penal.\nReuters fue el primer medio en reportar el ataque el jueves por la noche.\nLos ataques en el Caribe han causado inquietud entre legisladores demócratas y republicanos en Estados Unidos, y algunos de estos últimos afirman que no han recibido suficiente información sobre cómo se llevan a cabo dichas ofensivas. Una sesión informativa clasificada efectuada este mes para la Comisión de Servicios Armados del Senado no contó con la participación de representantes de agencias de inteligencia o de la estructura de mando militar para América del Sur y Centroamérica.\nSin embargo, la mayoría de los republicanos del Senado respaldaron al gobierno la semana pasada, cuando se presentó una votación sobre una resolución de poderes de guerra, que habría exigido que el gobierno obtuviera la aprobación del Congreso antes de realizar más ataques.\nSu disposición a respaldar al gobierno será puesta a prueba nuevamente. El senador demócrata Tim Kaine, junto con su homólogo Adam Schiff y Rand Paul, un republicano, han presentado otra resolución que impediría que Trump ataque directamente a Venezuela sin autorización del Congreso.\n___\nLos periodistas de The Associated Press Seung Min Kim, Aamer Madhani, Stephen Groves y Astrid Suárez contribuyeron a este despacho.\n___\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.",

    "body": "Rashee Rice to play first game for Chiefs in more than a year after suspension\nRashee Rice to play first game for Chiefs in more than a year after suspension\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Rashee Rice knows almost to the day how long it’s been since he played in a game for the Kansas City Chiefs.\nTwo more days until he does it again.\nTheir top wide receiver has missed the first six this season while serving an NFL suspension for violating its personal-conduct policy, the punishment handed down for his role in a high-speed car crash in Dallas in March 2024. And he missed most of last season after tearing his ACL in Week 4, when Patrick Mahomes collided with him following an interception.\n“I’ve been looking forward to this, I think it’s been 380-something days since I have played in a regular-season game,” Rice said Friday, following a final practice for Sunday’s game against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n“I mean, it’s been a long time coming,” he said. “The time is finally here.”\nRice recovered sufficiently from his knee injury in time to participate in the Chiefs’ offseason program, and he was able to take part in all of training camp. But once the season began, Rice had to remain away from the team, a punishment he agreed to when all parties decided it was in his best interest to get the six-game suspension out of the way.\nRice said he spent most of the time away in Florida, where the heat and humidity helped him stay in shape. He would work out Monday through Friday, then do another workout Sunday, as he tried to replicate what a typical game week is like.\nThe games themselves, Rice said, he would watch with family members. Kansas City lost its first two but has since won three of four, including a dominant victory last week over the Detroit Lions, widely considered a Super Bowl contender.\n“I mean, the best thing for me is to be around the guys. I got leaders in each room, even on defense, that help me on and off the field,” Rice said. “That’s the best part about being on a team like this. You have everybody to support you.”\nRice pleaded guilty to two felony charges for the wreck, including “collision involving serious bodily injury” and “racing on a highway causing bodily injury.” The district attorney’s office in Dallas said that Rice paid more than $115,000 in restitution to the victims, and his 30-day jail sentence can be served at any point during his five years of probation.\nRice declined Friday to discuss any of the legal issues he has faced, preferring to instead talk solely about football.\n“I learned that I love the game of football,” he replied, when asked what he had learned over the past year-plus. “I was able to realize how strong I am mentally, being able to face a lot of adversity.”\nChiefs coach Andy Reid wouldn’t say whether Rice would be on a snap count in his first game since Sept. 29, 2024, when he got hurt against the Chargers. But with a wide receiver corps that includes Xavier Worthy, Marquise Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster, the Chiefs are in the enviable position of not having to rush Rice back into the mix.\n“I’m sure he’s excited to play. He hasn’t played a real game for a year and six weeks,” Reid said. “I’m just going to watch it in the game. He knows everything. How many reps he gets — I’m sure it won’t be every rep. We’ll just see how he does.”\nMeanwhile, Chiefs left tackle Josh Simmons remained away from practice Friday for what Reid called “personal reasons,” leaving Jaylon Moore in line to start his second consecutive game. Simmons, the Chiefs’ first-round pick in April, was a late scratch from last week’s game against Detroit, and Moore stepped in on short notice and did an admirable job.\n“I know the work that Jaylon has put in. He’s been professional every single day,” Mahomes said. “He’s done his job and done it well, and having those reps in training camp and OTAs, I know he’s going to go out there and battle.\n“You’ve seen it now,” Mahomes added. “He’s a starting tackle in this league and can go out there and compete against anybody.”\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "body": "A look at the Tomahawk, a US cruise missile that could come into play in the Ukraine war\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Tomahawk cruise missile has been in the U.S. military’s inventory since the 1980s. While slow by missile standards, the cruise missile flies around 100 feet (about 30 meters) off the ground, making it harder to detect by defense systems.\nThe missile also boasts an impressive range of around 1,000 miles and precision guidance systems that make it the go-to weapon for striking targets that are deep inland or in hostile territory. President Donald Trump has hinted that he might give Tomahawks to Ukraine, which could make a key difference for Kyiv in its war with Moscow.\nLast year, The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, estimated that the Navy had roughly 4,000 Tomahawk missiles in its inventory in 2023. However, they noted that this estimate would have predated the significant military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn defending from Houthi attacks and launching counterattacks, the Navy said ships from the Eisenhower Carrier Strike group launched 135 Tomahawk missiles. That figure has likely only grown after the strike group returned home in the summer of 2024 since Trump ordered a month-long campaign of strikes against the group in the spring of 2025.\nMeanwhile, the US Navy has not been ordering many new Tomahawk missiles. Pentagon budget documents show that in 2023 the Navy and Marine Corps only bought 68 new missiles. The most recent budget documents show the Navy hadn’t purchased any new missiles in the following years and the Marine Corps only bought 22 missiles last year. Neither the Marines nor the Navy requested to buy any new Tomahawk missiles in the latest budget.\nAside from dwindling stocks, several defense officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to more candidly discuss military policy also expressed skepticism about offering the missile to Ukraine because of questions about how it would be employed.\nWhile the United States launched Tomahawk missiles almost exclusively from ships or submarines, Ukraine doesn’t possess a Navy with ships capable of carrying the 20-foot-long missile. The U.S. Army has been developing a platform to launch the missile from the ground, but one official said that the capability was still far from ready, even for U.S. forces.",

Three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul yielded no major breakthroughs.\n“There will be some progress (in Hungary), yes, again, regarding prisoner exchanges and the return of children from both sides, but I’m sure there won’t be any concrete action in the coming days,” Kondratov said.\nAnother Moscow resident, 58-year-old Alexander Fedotov, reckoned Trump’s peacemaking efforts could bear fruit.\n“Trump isn’t going to Europe for nothing. It’s a big trip for him after all,” he said. “I think there will be progress.”\nMore than three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor began and more than 10 years after it seized Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula, many are weary of the war.\n“I wish everyone well and peace. We’re all waiting for this, all Russians want it,” 55-year-old Svetlana, who didn’t give her last name, said in Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city.\nThe mood in Kyiv was less hopeful.\n“There are no expectations from any of these meetings, because the previous meetings showed that they are not productive,” Marichka Fartushna, an army medic, told the AP.\n“Trump has clearly shown his position. He is not for Ukraine,” she said.\nUkrainian veteran Ivan Balatskyi said that amid the intense diplomatic maneuvering he expects the U.S. to stand by Ukraine.\n“We showed the whole world that we can fight and we are ready to fight until the end,” he said. “And we expect support from our friends, Americans, from the American people.”\n___\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "body": "News stories show that reporters may have left the Pentagon, but they haven’t stopped working\nNews stories show that reporters may have left the Pentagon, but they haven’t stopped working\nTwo days after dozens of journalists left their desks at the Pentagon behind rather than agree to government-imposed rules on how they report about the U.S. military, it’s apparent they haven’t stopped working.\nReporters have relied on sources to break and add nuance to stories about U.S. attacks in the Caribbean on boats suspected of being involved in the drug trade, as well as military leadership in the region.\nThis comes as many are still navigating how their jobs will change — where will they work? who will talk with them? — brought on by the dispute. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth demanded reporters relinquish their Pentagon workspaces if they didn’t acknowledge rules the journalists say would punish them for reporting on anything beyond what he wants them to say.\nThe Pentagon has characterized the changes as “common sense” and accused journalists of mischaracterizing them.\n“The self-righteous media chose to self-deport from the Pentagon,” Hegseth’s chief spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on social media. “That’s their right — but also their loss. They will not be missed.”\nBreaking news on a U.S. attack with survivors\nWhile most press may have departed the Pentagon, it was clear from stories that some sources were still talking.\nReuters broke news Thursday about the first U.S. attack on a boat in the Caribbean where some of the passengers survived. Reporter Phil Stewart, stationed at the Pentagon before leaving Wednesday, sourced it to a “U.S. official” who was not named. President Donald Trump confirmed the attack on Friday as more details emerged, including that two people were taken into U.S. custody.\nThe New York Times reported on the sudden retirement of U.S. Navy Adm. Alvin Holsey, leader of the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations in Central and South America, including use of the military in the administration’s drug-fighting efforts.\nTimes reporters Eric Schmitt, who covers national security, and Tyler Pager, based in the White House, quoted two unnamed officials saying that Holsey had expressed concerns about the mission and attacks on the boats. The reporters pointed out the unusual nature of a retirement one year into Holsey’s expected three-year command.\nBoth Hegseth and Holsey released social media statements late Thursday announcing the retirement, with neither addressing reasons for it. A Times spokesman would not comment about whether the newspaper had begun inquiring about Holsey before the retirement was publicly announced.\nThe Washington Post reported Friday that 15 people had signed the new press policy. They included reporters from conservative outlets the Federalist and the Epoch Times and two from One America News. The others were foreign outlets and freelancers, including six from Turkey. No legacy media outlets agreed.\nThe newspaper cited a “government document viewed by The Washington Post.” The story was written not by a Pentagon reporter, but by media writer Scott Nover.\nOne reporter says stories show there are reasons to be hopeful\nNews outlets that said this week they would leave the Pentagon rather than agree to Hegseth’s rules stressed that it would not stop them from reporting on the military.\n“There are reasons to be hopeful that people can still deliver,” Nancy Youssef, a reporter for The Atlantic, said Friday. After leaving the Pentagon, she’s largely been working at The Atlantic’s Washington office about three miles away.\nAs much as the access issues raised by the Pentagon exit, reporters expressed concerns that it will make it easier for Hegseth and his team to avoid questions about their actions. For instance, Youssef said she had asked about what weapons had been used in an earlier boat attack, what the legal basis for the action was and the identities of those killed. She received no answer.\nYoussef said she also wondered whether journalists who did not sign on to the Pentagon’s rules would be permitted to visit other military sites or be embedded to cover military operations. That remains unclear.\n“If you’re in the Navy in charge of the carrier strike group, would you invite a journalist now?” she asked. “Practically speaking, are we allowed to go?”\nEven before this past week, Hegseth had taken steps to ban reporters from accessing large parts of the Pentagon without a government escort. He and his team have held only a handful of briefings for journalists.\nTwo journalists who spoke on background because their outlets would not permit on-the-record interviews said they’re concerned about having fewer opportunities for face-to-face contact with people who work in the Pentagon. Hegseth had begun requiring reporters get an escort to visit press offices for the military’s individual branches, but there were still public information officials near where the reporters worked.\nMany Pentagon reporters have developed sources in the building over the course of many years working there. It remains to be seen how many will still answer their calls. “Some people are going to be scared,” one reporter said. “I think that’s inevitable.”\nYoussef, however, noted in an article for The Atlantic that mid-level service members had reached out to her, unsolicited, to promise they would keep providing journalists with information. They said they would be doing this not to disobey current leadership but to uphold constitutional values, she wrote.\n___\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "body": "Indiana University fires student newspaper adviser who refused to block news stories\nTension between Indiana University and its student newspaper flared this week with the elimination of the outlet’s print editions and the firing of a faculty adviser, who refused an order to keep news stories out of a homecoming edition.\nAdministrators may have been hoping to minimize distractions this homecoming weekend as the school prepares to celebrate a Hoosiers football team with its highest-ever national ranking. Instead, the controversy has entangled the school in questions about censorship and student journalists’ First Amendment rights.\nAdvocates for student media, Indiana Daily Student alumni and high-profile supporters including billionaire Mark Cuban have blasted the school for stepping on the outlet’s independence.\nThe Daily Student is routinely honored among the best collegiate publications in the country. It receives about $250,000 annually in subsidies from the university’s Media School to help make up for dwindling ad revenue.\nOn Tuesday, the university fired the paper’s adviser, Jim Rodenbush, after he refused an order to force student editors to ensure no news stories ran in the print edition tied to the homecoming celebrations.\n“I had to make the decision that was going to allow me to live with myself,” Rodenbush said. “I don’t have any regrets whatsoever. In the current environment we’re in, somebody has to stand up.”\nIU says student journalists still call the shots\nA university spokesperson referred an AP reporter to a statement issued Tuesday, which said the campus wants to shift resources from print media to digital platforms both for students’ educational experience and to address the paper’s financial problems.\nChancellor David Reingold issued a separate statement Wednesday saying the school is “firmly committed to the free expression and editorial independence of student media. The university has not and will not interfere with their editorial judgment.”\nIt was late last year when university officials announced they were scaling back the cash-strapped newspaper’s print edition from a weekly to seven special editions per semester, tied to campus events.\nThe paper published three print editions this fall, inserting special event sections, Rodenbush said. Last month, Media School officials started asking why the special editions still contained news, he said.\nRodenbush said IU Media School Dean David Tolchinsky told him earlier this month that the expectation was print editions would contain no news. Tolchinsky argued Rodenbush was essentially the paper’s publisher and could decide what to run, Rodenbush said. He told the dean that publishing decisions were the students’ alone, he said.\nTolchinsky fired him Tuesday, two days before the homecoming print edition was set to be published, and announced the end of all Indiana Daily Student print publications.\n“Your lack of leadership and ability to work in alignment with the University’s direction for the Student Media Plan is unacceptable,” Tolchinsky wrote in Rodenbush’s termination letter.\nThe newspaper was allowed to continue publishing stories on its website.\nStudent journalists see a ‘scare tactic’\nAndrew Miller, the Indiana Daily Student’s co-editor-in-chief, said in a statement that Rodenbush “did the right thing by refusing to censor our print edition” and called the termination a “deliberate scare tactic toward journalists and faculty.”\n“IU has no legal right to dictate what we can and cannot print in our paper,” Miller said.\nMike Hiestand, senior legal counsel at the Student Press Law Center, said First Amendment case law going back 60 years shows student editors at public universities determine content. Advisors like Rodenbush can’t interfere, Hiestand said.\n“It’s open and shut, and it’s just so bizarre that this is coming out of Indiana University,” Hiestand said. “If this was coming out of a community college that doesn’t know any better, that would be one thing. But this is coming out of a place that absolutely should know better.”\nRodenbush said that he wasn’t aware of any single story the newspaper has published that may have provoked administrators. But he speculated the moves may be part of a “general progression” of administrators trying to protect the university from any negative publicity.\nBlocked from publishing a print edition, the paper this week posted a number of sharp-edged stories online, including coverage of the opening of a new film critical of arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators last year, a tally of campus sexual assaults and an FBI raid on the home of a former professor suspected of stealing federal funds.\nThe paper also has covered allegations that IU President Pamela Whitten plagiarized parts of her dissertation, with the most recent story running in September.",

    "body": "Billionaire Illinois Gov. Pritzker wins blackjack pot of $1.4M in Las Vegas\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — It figures that a billionaire would win big in Las Vegas.\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker reported a gambling windfall of $1.4 million on his federal tax return this week.\nThe two-term Democrat, often mentioned as a 2028 presidential candidate, told reporters in Chicago on Thursday that he drew charmed hands in blackjack during a vacation with first lady MK Pritzker and friends in Sin City.\n“I was incredibly lucky,” he said. “You have to be to end up ahead, frankly, going to a casino anywhere.”\nPritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain, has a net worth of $3.9 billion, tied for No. 382 on the Forbes 400 list of the nation’s richest people. A campaign spokesperson said via email that Pritzker planned to donate the money to charity but did not respond when asked why he hadn’t already done so.\nPritzker, who intends to seek a third term in 2026, was under consideration as a vice presidential running mate to Kamala Harris last year. He has deflected questions about any ambition beyond the Illinois governor’s mansion. But he has used his personal wealth to fund other Democrats and related efforts, including a campaign to protect access to abortion.\nHis profile has gotten an additional bump this fall as he condemns President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement in the Chicago area and the president’s attempt to deploy National Guard troops there.\nThe Pritzkers reported income of $10.66 million in 2024, mostly from dividends and capital gains. They paid $1.6 million in taxes on taxable income of $5.87 million.\nPritzker is an avid card player whose charitable Chicago Poker Challenge has raised millions of dollars for the Holocaust Museum and Education Center. The Vegas windfall was a “net number” given wins and losses on one trip, he said. He declined to say what his winning hand was.\n“Anybody who’s played cards in a casino, you often play for too long and lose whatever it is you won,” Pritzker said. “I was fortunate enough to have to leave before that happened.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago.",

    "body": "LA county reaches tentative $828M agreement to settle 400 more claims of sexual abuse\nLA county reaches tentative $828M agreement to settle 400 more claims of sexual abuse\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles County has reached a tentative $828 million agreement to settle more than 400 additional sexual abuse claims against county employees, months after approving the largest sexual abuse settlement in U.S. history, officials said Friday.\nThe agreement still needs approval from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The county approved the historic $4 billion settlement in April for thousands of claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities since 1959, officials said.\nIt also comes as the county investigates allegations that some people included in the $4 billion settlement were paid to file claims. A Los Angeles Times investigation reported that nine plaintiffs said they were paid to sue, and four of them have said they made fraudulent claims.\nCounty officials said in announcing the new settlement for 400 additional claims that “the credibility of every individual claim will be reviewed, and plaintiffs determined to have submitted fraudulent claims will receive no money from the settlement.”\nThe plaintiffs were able to sue because of a California law that took effect in 2020 that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims to bring cases for three years.\nThe lawsuits filed by thousands of people alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in the county.\nInitially the $4 billion agreement was to settle 7,000 claims but that grew to 11,000, officials said. The county said it now faces as many as 2,500 additional cases beyond those covered by the two settlements and that the total number of claims could run as high as 14,000 or more. Officials said the settlements were causing financial strain for the county.\nUnder the $4 billion settlement, the amount paid to each plaintiff could range from $100,000 to $3 million. If the latest settlement is approved, individual awards will be determined based on factors including the severity of abuse alleged.\nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said the system is vulnerable to fraud but officials are strengthening their review process to ensure settlement money only goes to victims.\nTo prevent fraud, the county said every plaintiff must complete a detailed, multipage summary, under penalty of perjury, of the abuse suffered, and additional proof may be requested.\nClaims brought by the law firm Downtown L.A. Law Group, or DTLA, in the April settlement will undergo additional scrutiny, officials said.\nSome of the plaintiffs represented by the firm told the Los Angeles Times that people they met outside a county social services office offered them money to submit claims, drove them to the DTLA firm and then paid them amounts ranging from $50 to $200 each.\nCalifornia law prohibits non-attorneys from soliciting people to sign up for lawsuits with a firm.\nDTLA denies any wrongdoing. Those plaintiffs could be asked to do additional interviews and provide more proof of allegations, depending on the nature of the claim and the suspected fraud, the county said.\nThe county may also refer attorneys accused of paying for claims to the state bar for possible disciplinary action, officials said.\n“The conduct alleged to have occurred by the DTLA firm is absolutely outrageous and must be investigated by the appropriate authorities. Not only does it undermine our justice system, it also deprives legitimate claimants of just compensation,” said Dawyn R. Harrison, the county’s counsel. “While both settlements have protections to ensure that this is not a windfall for fraudulent plaintiffs, legislative protections must be put in place to ensure unscrupulous lawyers don’t get windfalls at the expense of survivors of abuse.”\nDTLA Law Group said in a statement that it filtered through nearly 13,000 inquiries and only accepted a fraction of the cases.\n“We do not pay our clients to file lawsuits, and we strongly oppose such actions. If we ever became aware that anyone associated with us, in any capacity, did such a thing, we would end our relationship with them immediately,” the firm said. “We want justice for real victims.”\nThe county’s ability to assess the validity of allegations was hampered by a lack of records, the sheer number of cases and court ordered limits on legal discovery, officials said.\nThe county has also put into place more safeguards to prevent abuse and act quickly if it does occur. That includes a new hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees that is expected to be in place by year’s end.\nThe $4 billion settlement in April far surpassed a $2.6 billion settlement reached in 2022 with Boy Scouts of America that was the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in U.S. history at the time.",

Mike Dunleavy said in a request to the White House for a major disaster declaration.\nIn one of the hardest hit villages, Kipnuk, an initial assessment showed that 121 homes — or 90% of the total — have been destroyed, Dunleavy wrote. In Kwigillingok, where three dozen homes floated away, slightly more than one-third of the residences are uninhabitable.\nThe remnants of Typhoon Halong struck the area with the ferocity of a Category 2 hurricane, Dunleavy said, sending a surge of high surf into the low-lying region. One person was killed, two remain missing, and rescue crews plucked dozens of people from their homes as they floated away.\nOfficials have been scrambling to airlift people from the inundated Alaska Native villages. More than 2,000 people across the region have taken shelter — in schools in their villages, in larger communities in southwest Alaska or have been evacuated by military planes to Anchorage, the state’s largest city.\nAnchorage leaders said Friday they expect as many as 1,600 evacuees to arrive. So far about 575 have been airlifted to the city by the Alaska National Guard, and have been staying at a sports arena or a convention center. Additional flights were expected Friday and Saturday.\nOfficials are working on figuring out how to move people out of shelters and into short-term accommodations, such as hotels, and then longer-term housing.\n“Due to the time, space, distance, geography, and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” Dunleavy said. “Agencies are prioritizing rapid repairs ... but it is likely that some damaged communities will not be viable to support winter occupancy, in America’s harshest climate in the U.S. Arctic.”\nThe federal government already has been assisting with search and rescue, damage assessments, environmental response and evacuation support. A major disaster declaration by President Donald Trump could provide federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure, including money for emergency and permanent work.\nThe three members of Alaska’s congressional delegation on Friday sent a letter to Trump, urging swift approval.\nThe storm surge pummeled a sparsely populated region off the state’s main road system where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year. The villages typically have just a few hundred residents, who hunt and fish for much of their food, and relocating to the state’s major cities will bring a vastly different lifestyle.\nAlexie Stone, of Kipnuk, arrived in Anchorage in a military jet with his brothers, children and mom, after his home was struck by the flooding. They’ve been staying at the Alaska Airlines Center at the University of Alaska, where the Red Cross provided evacuees with cots, blankets and hygiene supplies.\nAt least for the foreseeable future, he thinks he might try to find a job at a grocery store; he used to work in one in Bethel.\n“It’s going to be, try to look for a place and find a job,” Stone said Friday. “We’re starting a new life here in Anchorage.”\nAnchorage officials and business leaders said Friday they were eager to help the evacuees.\n“Our neighbors in western Alaska have experienced tremendous loss, devastation and grief,” Mayor Suzanne LaFrance said at a meeting of the Anchorage Assembly. “We will do everything we can here in Anchorage to welcome our neighbors and help them through these difficult times.”\nState Rep. Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, of Toksook Bay, on an island northwest of Kipnuk, described for the assembly how she rode out the storm’s 100 mph (161 kmh) winds with her daughter and niece.\n“We had no choice but to sit in our home and wait to see if our house is going to come off the foundation or if debris is going to bust open our windows,” she said.\nIt didn’t, but others weren’t as fortunate. She thanked Anchorage for welcoming the evacuees.\n“You are showing my people, my relatives, my constituents, even if they are far from home, this is still Alaska land and they’re amongst families,” Jimmie said.\n___\nJohnson reported from Seattle.",

Waddy survived his injuries.\nAmong the bystanders injured, one was shot in the arm and required surgery, another was hit in the back with by a bullet that exited through her arm. Another man was grazed by a bullet on the foot.\nIn a statement, attorneys for the six wounded bystanders said the new award for damages “recognizes the suffering that these six victims endured at the hands of an officer who vowed to serve and protect.”\nAttorney Omeed Azmoudeh said separately that the award sends “a clear message about police conduct” and that bystanders “are not just a backdrop that you can’t think about.”\nA Denver police spokesperson, Officer Kurt Barnes, said Ramos resigned in February 2024 and the department had no comment on the verdict.",

    "body": "Bolton pleads not guilty in Justice Department case accusing him of sharing government secrets\nBolton pleads not guilty in Justice Department case accusing him of sharing government secrets\nGREENBELT, Md. (AP) — John Bolton pleaded not guilty Friday to charges accusing the former Trump national security adviser turned critic of emailing classified information to family members and keeping top secret documents at his Maryland home.\nBolton was ordered released from custody after making his appearance before a judge in the third Justice Department case brought in recent weeks against an adversary of President Donald Trump.\nThe case accusing Bolton of putting the country’s national security at risk is unfolding against the backdrop of growing concerns that the Trump administration is using the law enforcement powers of the Justice Department to pursue his political foes. Bolton has signaled he will argue he is being targeted because of his criticism of the president, describing the charges as part of a Trump “effort to intimidate his opponents.”\nThe investigation into Bolton, however, was already well underway by the time Trump took office a second time this past January and appears to have followed a more conventional path toward indictment than other recent cases against perceived Trump foes, who were charged by the president’s hand-picked U.S. attorney in Virginia over the concerns of career prosecutors.\nBolton is accused of sharing with his wife and daughter more than 1,000 pages of notes that included sensitive information he had gleaned from meetings with other U.S. government officials and foreign leaders or from intelligence briefings. Authorities say some of the information was exposed when operatives believed to be linked to the Iranian government hacked Bolton’s email account he used to send diary-like notes about his activities to his relatives.\nThe Justice Department also alleges Bolton stored at his home highly classified intelligence about a foreign adversary’s plans to attack U.S. forces overseas, covert action taken by the U.S. government and other state secrets.\n“There is one tier of justice for all Americans,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday. “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.”\nBolton, 76, is a longtime fixture in Republican foreign policy circles who became known for his hawkish views on American power and who served for more than a year in Trump’s first administration before being fired in 2019. He later published a book highly critical of Trump.\nThe indictment is significantly more detailed in its allegations than earlier cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Unlike in those cases filed by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Bolton’s indictment was signed by career national security prosecutors.\nCase centers on top secret national security information\nBolton suggested the criminal case was an outgrowth of an unsuccessful Justice Department effort after he left government to block the publication of his 2020 book “The Room Where It Happened,” which portrayed Trump as grossly misinformed about foreign policy.\nBolton’s lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer had classified information.\nAuthorities say Bolton took meticulous notes about his meetings and briefings as national security adviser and then used a personal email account and messaging platform to share information classified as high as top secret with his family members. After sending one document, Bolton wrote in a message to his relatives, “None of which we talk about!!!” In response, one of his relatives wrote, “Shhhhh,” prosecutors said.\nThe two family members were not identified in court papers, but a person familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details, identified them as Bolton’s wife and daughter.\nA Bolton representative told the FBI in July 2021 that his email account had been hacked by operatives believed to be linked to the Iranian government but did not reveal he had shared classified information through the account or that the hackers now had possession of government secrets, according to the indictment.\nBolton’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the “underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago.”\nHe said the charges stem from portions of Bolton’s personal diaries over his 45-year career in government and included unclassified information that was shared only with his immediate family and was known to the FBI as far back as 2021.\n“Like many public officials throughout history,” Lowell said, “Bolton kept diaries — that is not a crime.” He said Bolton “did not unlawfully share or store any information.”\nJustice Department has long history of classified documents cases\nThe Justice Department has a long history of investigations into the mishandling of classified information, including by public officials. The outcomes of those investigations have turned in part on whether officials developed evidence of willful mishandling or other crimes such as obstruction.\nTrump, for instance, was charged not only with hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate but also with obstructing government efforts to get them back. Special counsel Jack Smith dropped the case after Trump was elected last November, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.\nProsecutors in a separate investigation found evidence that President Joe Biden had willfully retained and shared classified information when he a private citizen but opted against charges in part because they thought Biden might come across to a jury as “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”\nAnother high-profile investigation concerned 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who was spared charges after then-FBI Director James Comey said investigators did not determine that she intended to break the law when she sent emails containing classified information on a private email server while serving as Secretary of State.\nOne investigation that may carry parallels to the Bolton case is the prosecution of former CIA Director David Petraeus, who in 2015 admitted to sharing classified information with his biographer while she was working on the book. He was sentenced to probation following a plea agreement with the Justice Department.\n___\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington.",

    "body": "Who’s winning the blame game over the shutdown? Here’s what a new AP-NORC poll shows\nWho’s winning the blame game over the shutdown? Here’s what a new AP-NORC poll shows\nWASHINGTON (AP) — As the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight, a new AP-NORC poll finds that most Americans see it as a significant problem — and all of the major players are being blamed.\nRoughly 6 in 10 Americans say President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility for the shutdown, while 54% say the same about Democrats in Congress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a “moderate” share of blame, underscoring that no one is successfully evading responsibility.\nThe survey, conducted as the shutdown stretched into its third week, comes as leaders warn it could soon become the longest in history. Democrats are demanding an extension of tax credits that have helped millions of people afford health insurance since the coronavirus pandemic, while Republicans have refused to negotiate until Congress passes a funding bill to reopen the government.\nThe standoff has become a messaging battle, with each party betting the public will blame the other. The stakes are especially high for Democrats, now out of power and searching for a unifying fight to rally around ahead of pivotal 2026 midterm elections.\nSlightly more of the public’s frustration appears to be aimed at the party in power. The poll finds that about half of Americans say Trump has “a great deal” of responsibility for the shutdown, the very highest amount of responsibility offered in the poll. That’s roughly the same share who fault Republicans in Congress, but higher than the 40% who say the same of Democrats.\nGovernment shutdown\nThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?\nSophia Cole, a 38-year-old Republican mother from St. Louis, placed equal blame for the shutdown on Trump and Congress. Cole, who described herself as a Trump supporter, said both sides “should be able to come together” on a compromise but believes it is ultimately the Republican president’s responsibility to broker a deal.\n“We’re dependent on him to get the House and everyone to vote the way that he needs them to vote,” Cole said.\nDemocrats and independents more likely to call the shutdown a ‘major issue’\nThe effects of the shutdown are beginning to be felt across the country. Flights have been delayed, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay are starting to miss paychecks.\nThe poll finds that 54% of U.S. adults call the shutdown a “major issue,” with just 11% saying it is “not a problem at all.” Democrats are most likely, at 69%, to see it as a major problem, but 59% of independents and 37% of Republicans feel the same way.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said this week the country is “barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history.” The last shutdown, during Trump’s first term, went to for a record 35 days and drew similar public sentiment, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to see it as a major problem.\nThe White House has warned the impact of the shutdown could be worse this time. While roughly 2 million service members were paid on time this week, the administration has used the federal workforce as leverage, and last weekend it began following through on threats to lay off federal workers. But on Wednesday, a federal judge in California temporarily blocked the firings, saying they appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought.\n“Things are just going to keep getting worse for federal workers,” said Angie Santiago, a 60-year-old Democrat from Miami. “If people like me are struggling, I can’t imagine what federal workers are going through.”\nSantiago, who is on disability while her husband works, said she fears the shutdown will worsen economic hardship across the country. Santiago said during a phone interview that she began regularly going to food banks about a year ago.\n“I’m calling you from a food line,” she said. “You’re going to see more of these lines popping up. It’s going to get bad.”\nMore favor than oppose extending health care subsidies\nAt the center of the shutdown is a stalemate over federal tax credits for people who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Democrats want the credits extended, while Republicans say they will discuss the issue only once the government reopens.\nThe poll shows that roughly 4 in 10 U.S. adults support extending the tax credits, while about 1 in 10 oppose it outright. A large share, 42%, have no opinion, suggesting many Americans are not closely following the core dispute driving the shutdown.\nJason Beck, a Republican who is a self-employed insurance agent in Utah, uses the Affordable Care Act marketplace for his own insurance and supports extending the tax credits.\n“I know a lot of the shutdown is over health insurance, and I’d rather just keep it the same way it is now,” Beck said of the subsidies.\nDemocrats say that keeping health insurance prices the same is central to their fight and that prices will skyrocket if Congress doesn’t do anything. But even Beck, who is on the Democrats’ side with the subsidies, still places equal blame for the shutdown on Democrats, Republicans and Trump.\n“Trump’s blaming the Democrats, and the Democrats are blaming the Republicans,” Beck said. “We’re stuck because there’s no middle ground anymore.”\nNeither party sees a substantial bump in favorability\nBoth parties have framed the shutdown as a prelude to the 2026 midterms, with Democrats aiming to flip the House. So far, however, it doesn’t appear to have meaningfully shifted opinions about either party.\nAbout 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of the Democratic Party, in line with an AP-NORC poll from September. Four in 10 have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of the Republican Party, similar to last month.\nConfidence in Congress, meanwhile, remains extremely low. Only about 4% of Americans say they have “a great deal” of confidence in the way Congress is being run, while 43% have “only some” confidence and about half have “hardly any” confidence.\nBut the poll suggests that health care could be a helpful issue for Democrats down the road. The poll found that 38% of Americans trust Democrats to do a better job handling health care, while only 25% trust Republicans more. About 1 in 10 trust both equally, and 25% trust neither.\nRob Redding, a 49-year-old independent voter from New York, supports extending ACA subsidies and credits Democrats for defending them.\nRedding said Democrats holding the line on the ACA subsidies is probably one of the most valiant and gutsy things he’s ever seen them do.\n“And,” Redding said, “I think that it’s the right call.”\n___\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,289 adults was conducted Oct. 9-13, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n___\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the federal government shutdown at https://apnews.com/hub/government-shutdown.",

    "body": "For the first time, a California county removed its sheriff over misconduct allegations\nFor the first time in California history, a county sheriff has been removed from office.\nThe San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to remove Sheriff Christina Corpus from office Tuesday, nearly a year after a damning report from a retired county judge found that she likely violated the county’s policy on nepotism and conflicting relationships.\nRemoving her wasn’t as simple as firing someone. It took a successful San Mateo County ballot measure that asked voters to choose whether to amend the county charter to grant the board that power.\n“Today is the end of a tragic, destructive and grossly expensive chapter in San Mateo County history,” said Supervisor Jackie Speier, a former member of Congress. “I had high hopes for Sheriff Corpus. I voted for her, I held a town hall with her on crime prevention. She had great ideas to modernize the office.\n“So it’s tragic to see her time as sheriff come down to this.”\nCorpus still has 14 days to appeal her removal. San Mateo County Attorney John Nibbelin said the county’s undersheriff will serve as sheriff.\nCorpus, appearing in a blue suit at the board meeting, argued adamantly against her removal. She said she was elected as a reformer, and the changes she tried to push through the sheriff’s office were met with first resistance, then outright hostility, when the old guard in power in San Mateo County began working to undermine her.\n“I have sacrificed my peace, my marriage, for this job,” Corpus said. “If I lose my position today, I will walk out with my head held very high. I never bowed to intimidation.\n“You may remove me from office but you will not erase the truth.”\nCorpus’ legal team, which now includes a one-time member of President Barack Obama’s cabinet, made a half-hour presentation arguing against the legality of her removal.\n“Culture change is hard,” said Tom Perez, who was labor secretary under Obama and former chair of the Democratic National Committee. “From Day One, there were folks who didn’t want her to succeed.”\nThe county of San Mateo, one of the wealthiest in the country, has been paying Corpus’ legal bills. If she is removed in two weeks, she will be responsible for her legal costs from that point.\nLast week, retired Superior Court Judge James Emerson found cause to remove Corpus after a two-week trial that included a cascade of allegations portraying a chaotic picture of her two-plus years in office.\nEmerson found that Corpus had “a close personal relationship outside the boundaries of a professional working relationship” with a subordinate, unlawfully ordered the arrest of the president of the sheriff’s deputies’ union and retaliated against a captain who refused to conduct the union president’s arrest because he believed it violated state law.\nIf Corpus is not removed, she will return to a unique six-year term afforded to elected members of law enforcement in 2022 when the state moved county sheriff and district attorney races to the presidential election year calendar.\nAbout 25 people spoke during the board’s public comment period. Some came to praise Corpus, others to bury her, none more so than the daughter of the sheriff’s deputies’ union president, whom Corpus ordered arrested last year – something Judge Emerson found was retaliatory.\nThe sheriff’s office alleged that the union president, Carlos Tapia, was doing union business on company time and falsified the record of his working hours. But an investigation by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office found no reason to charge Tapia, determining that the errors on his time cards were clerical and concluding that Tapia “should not have been arrested.\nA captain in the sheriff’s office resigned rather than arrest Tapia, and Tapia alleged in a lawsuit filed against the county that Corpus demanded his arrest as retaliation against him for complaining about her leadership.\nVanessa Lemus-Tapia, Tapia’s daughter, said at the meeting that Corpus was incorrectly claiming credit for reducing crime in San Mateo County when the rate for most major crimes statewide has fallen.\n“That was not her doing,” Lemus-Tapia said, before addressing Corpus directly. “Stop fighting this. Restore trust, dignity and integrity to this department.”\n___\nThis story was originally published by CalMatters and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

    "body": "Journalists turn in access badges, exit Pentagon rather than agree to new reporting rules\nJournalists turn in access badges, exit Pentagon rather than agree to new reporting rules\nNEW YORK (AP) — Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed restrictions on their work, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power. The nation’s leadership called the new rules “common sense” to help regulate a “very disruptive” press.\nNews outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they sought to report on information — classified or otherwise — that had not been approved by Hegseth for release.\nMany of the reporters waited to leave together at a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Defense Department to get out of the building. As the hour approached, boxes of documents lined a Pentagon corridor and reporters carried chairs, a copying machine, books and old photos to the parking lot from suddenly abandoned workspaces. Shortly after 4, about 40 to 50 journalists left together after handing in badges.\n“It’s sad, but I’m also really proud of the press corps that we stuck together,” said Nancy Youssef, a reporter for The Atlantic who has had a desk at the Pentagon since 2007. She took a map of the Middle East out to her car.\nIt is unclear what practical impact the new rules will have, though news organizations vowed they’d continue robust coverage of the military no matter the vantage point.\nImages of reporters effectively demonstrating against barriers to their work are unlikely to move supporters of President Donald Trump, many of whom resent journalists and cheer his efforts to make their jobs harder. Trump has been involved in court fights against The New York Times, CBS News, ABC News, the Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press in the past year.\nTrump supports the new rules\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump backed his defense secretary’s new rules. “I think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace,” Trump said. “The press is very dishonest.”\nEven before issuing his new press policy, Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel host, has systematically choked off the flow of information. He’s held only two formal press briefings, banned reporters from accessing many parts of the sprawling Pentagon without an escort and launched investigations into leaks to the media.\nHe has called his new rules “common sense” and said the requirement that journalists sign a document outlining the rules means they acknowledge the new rules, not necessarily agree to them. Journalists see that as a distinction without a difference.\n“What they’re really doing, they want to spoon-feed information to the journalist, and that would be their story. That’s not journalism,” said Jack Keane, a retired U.S. Army general and Fox News analyst, said on Hegseth’s former network.\nWhen he served, Keane said he required new brigadier generals to take a class on the role of the media in a democracy so they wouldn’t be intimidated and also see reporters as a conduit to the American public. “There were times when stories were done that made me flinch a little bit,” he said. “But that’s usually because we had done something that wasn’t as good as we should have done it.”\nYoussef said it made no sense to sign on to rules that said reporters should not solicit military officials for information. “To agree to not solicit information is to agree to not be a journalist,” she said. “Our whole goal is soliciting information.”\nReporting on US military affairs will continue — from a greater distance\nSeveral reporters posted on social media when they turned in their press badges.\n“It’s such a tiny thing, but I was really proud to see my picture up on the wall of Pentagon correspondents,” wrote Heather Mongilio, a reporter for USNINews, which covers the Navy. “Today, I’ll hand in my badge. The reporting will continue.”\nMongilio, Youssef and others emphasized that they’ll continue to do their jobs no matter where their desks are. Some sources will continue to speak with them, although they say some in the military have been chilled by threats from Pentagon leadership.\nIn an essay, NPR reporter Tom Bowman noted the many times he’d been tipped off by people he knew from the Pentagon and while embedded in the military about what was happening, even if it contradicted official lines put out by leadership. Many understand the media’s role.\n“They knew the American public deserved to know what’s going on,” Bowman wrote. “With no reporters able to ask questions, it seems the Pentagon leadership will continue to rely on slick social media posts, carefully orchestrated short videos and interviews with partisan commentators and podcasters. No one should think that’s good enough.”\nThe Pentagon Press Association, whose 101 members represent 56 news outlets, has spoken out against the rules. Organizations from across the media spectrum, from legacy organizations like The Associated Press and The New York Times to outlets like Fox and the conservative Newsmax, told their reporters to leave instead of signing the new rules.\nOnly the conservative One America News Network signed on. Its management likely believes it will have greater access to Trump administration officials by showing its support, Gabrielle Cuccia, a former Pentagon reporter who was fired by OANN earlier this year for writing an online column criticizing Hegseth’s media policies, told the AP in an interview.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Laurie Kellman in London contributed to this report.

Joni Ernst, a Republican who is stepping down after serving two terms. They include state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek and military veteran Nathan Sage.\nOn the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is running for the nomination against former state Sen. Jim Carlin, among others. Republicans are favored to retain the seat in a state where Republican President Donald Trump won 56% of the vote and defeated Democrat Kamala Harris by 13.2 percentage points in the November 2024 election.\nErnst’s surprise announcement last month that she would not seek reelection in 2026 created an unexpected opening. But the move hasn’t made national Democratic campaign leadership any more aggressive, nor made Republicans anxious, about the seat.\nDemocrats must gain a net of four seats to seize the Senate majority, a tall task for the party, considering most of the states holding Senate elections next year were carried by Trump in 2024. Democrats have been more focused on recruiting candidates in pickup opportunities such as Maine, where Trump lost last year, and North Carolina, where Trump won narrowly.\nRoberts’ arrest by ICE came at a terrible time for Norris, a former chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama who launched her campaign in August emphasizing her service on the Des Moines school board and past as a classroom teacher.\nShe was thrust into the spotlight as the public tried to understand how the board could have hired Roberts in 2023, when authorities said the native of Guyana was living and working illegally in the U.S. Days after the arrest, Norris faced criticism for posting a video ahead of a quarterly Sept. 30 fundraising deadline seeking donations.\n__\nAP political reporter Thomas Beaumont contributed from Des Moines, Iowa.",

But these bunnies are robots meant to lure the giant invasive snakes out of their hiding spots.\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — They look, move and even smell like the kind of furry Everglades marsh rabbit a Burmese python would love to eat. But these bunnies are robots meant to lure the giant invasive snakes out of their hiding spots.\nIt’s the latest effort by the South Florida Water Management District to eliminate as many pythons as possible from the Everglades, where they are decimating native species with their voracious appetites. In Everglades National Park, officials say the snakes have eliminated 95% of small mammals as well as thousands of birds.\n“Removing them is fairly simple. It’s detection. We’re having a really hard time finding them,” said Mike Kirkland, lead invasive animal biologist for the water district. “They’re so well camouflaged in the field.”\nThe water district and University of Florida researchers deployed 120 robot rabbits this summer as an experiment. Previously, there was an effort to use live rabbits as snake lures but that became too expensive and time-consuming, Kirkland said.\nThe robots are simple toy rabbits, but retrofitted to emit heat, a smell and to make natural movements to appear like any other regular rabbit. “They look like a real rabbit,” Kirkland said.. They are solar powered and can be switched on and off remotely. They are placed in small pens monitored by a video camera that sends out a signal when a python is nearby.\n“Then I can deploy one of our many contractors to go out and remove the python,” Kirkland said.\nThe total cost per robot rabbit is about $4,000, financed by the water district, he added.\nPythons are not native to Florida, but have become established in the swampy, subtropical Everglades by escaping from homes or by people releasing them when they become overgrown pets. A female python can lay between 50 and 100 eggs at a time with a gestation period of 60-90 days, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\nIt’s not easy to find definite estimates of the number of pythons in Florida. The U.S. Geological Survey recently reported a ballpark number of “tens of thousands,” while other official estimates run as high as 300,000 snakes. They have few natural enemies, although there are occasional confrontations with alligators, and other predators, such as bobcats and coyotes, will eat their eggs.\nSince 2000, more than 23,000 of the snakes have been removed from the wild, the wildlife commission says. The robot rabbits are the latest attempt to tackle snakes that average between 10 and 16 feet (3 to 5 meters) in length when fully grown.\n“Every invasive python that is removed makes a difference for Florida’s environment and its native wildlife,” said Ron Bergeron, a member of the water district governing board.\nPythons can be humanely killed year-round on private lands and on lands managed by the wildlife commission across the state.\nEach year the commission holds a “Florida Python Challenge” that carries cash prizes for most pythons caught, the longest snake and so forth. This year, 934 people from 30 states took part in the effort in July, capturing 294 pythons with a top prize of $10,000 to a participant who bagged 60 of the reptiles.\nIt’s too early to determine how successful the robot rabbit project will be, but officials say initial results are a cause for optimism.\n“This part of the project is in its infancy,” Kirkland said. “We are confident, though, that this will work once we are given enough time to work out some of these details.”\n_____\nAnderson reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.",

(AP) — Kylan Darnell became an overnight celebrity in the TikTok niche that documents the glitzy, ritualistic recruitment process for sororities. As a 21-year-old rising senior four years later, she’s taking more of her sorority life offline.\nDarnell has until now been the embodiment of RushTok, a week-long marathon that has teens at schools around the country meticulously documenting their efforts to land a cherished spot in a sorority during the colorful, girly and enigmatic recruitment process known as rush week.\nReactions to the content that once catapulted her to fame — depicting her life as a Zeta Tau Alpha member at the University of Alabama — had become so negative that it was affecting her mental health, she said.\n“This year it was just like a whole different level of hate,” Darnell said.\nCiting a need to protect prospects from harassment, many sororities have made similar moves, issuing a de facto ban against talking to the press or posting on social media during rush week at Alabama, where almost 13,000 students participate in the nation’s largest on-campus Greek life.\nA centuries-old tradition\nAcross the country, rush is typically a 10-day event where “prospective new members” try out sororities through rounds of activities prescribing a strict slate of outfits and etiquette. In the lead-up, girls often submit “social resumes” and letters of recommendation from sorority alums.\nParticipation often requires an eye-opening price tag.\nAfter spending sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on outfits, makeup and plane tickets, each of this week’s 2,600 recruits paid $550 to participate. It’s non-refundable if they don’t get picked. If accepted, they’ll pay an average $8,400 a semester to live in the sorority house, or $4,100 if they live elsewhere, according to the Alabama Panhellenic Association.\nThe pressure can be so intense that an industry of consultants now helps girls navigate the often mysterious criteria for landing a desired sorority. Some charge up to $10,000 for months of services that can begin in high school.\nThroughout rush, many events are invite-only. At any point, girls can get a dreaded call informing them they’ve been dropped — that a sorority is no longer interested in letting them join. Matches are finally made on bid day as prospects rank top choices and sororities make offers.\nMorgan Cadenhead, now 20, gained such an audience on RushTok despite being dropped that she covered most of her tuition with income from social media. Then came the social cost as she was slammed online for criticizing Greek life. Now the marketing major — featured on Lifetime’s “Sorority Mom’s Guide to Rush!” — said she’s looking for offline work.\nA zealous TikTok following\nA fixation with rush was renewed when sororities resumed in-person recruiting after the pandemic.\nSocial media became flooded with “outfit of the day” and “get ready with me” videos showing sorority members and recruits in well-lit rooms, sometimes flaunting exorbitantly priced designer wear or pieces purchased on Amazon, always precisely curated.\nAlabama’s Greek life got attention before, when its traditionally white sororities racially integrated, accepting their first Black members in 2013. Targeted by protests following allegations of racial discrimination, the university agreed with the Justice Department in 2016 to encourage diversity. Today, Black students outside of traditionally Black sororities and fraternities represent 2% of the total Greek membership, the university website says.\nMeanwhile, online attention to rush has led to books, a polarizing documentary and the reality television series, widening the appeal of sororities in the South in particular, according to Lorie Stefaneli, a New York City-based consultant who flies to Tuscaloosa each year for rush.\nStefaneli coaches girls from around the country, and about a third of her clients enroll at Alabama. She says many are drawn by the vibrant depictions of sisterhood, showing female friendships that can ensure girls feel seen and supported.\n“That’s the reason why a lot of them want to go to Alabama, is because they see it on TikTok,” Stefaneli said.\nRecruits told to stop posting — or else\nIf they gain enough followers to become social influencers, RushTok participants can earn ad revenue and brand deals. Darnell’s posts brought her financial independence, more than covering the $58,000 it costs her annually to attend Alabama from out-of-state.\nRush can be fun and help girls build confidence, but it’s also an “emotional rollercoaster,” especially for girls who feel they need to reveal themselves to a massive audience, Stefaneli said. She answers phone calls at all hours of the night during rush week.\n“I’m literally a therapist, I’m talking these girls down from a ledge,” she said.\nNumerous incoming freshmen told The Associated Press this week that they were expressly prohibited from speaking with the media or even posting about rush at Alabama. Darnell said the most selective “Old Row” houses will automatically drop prospects who do.\n“Now a lot of girls just come to the university to be influencers,” she said. “It kind of gets in the way of sisterhood.”\nSome incoming freshmen — including Darnell’s 19-year-old sister Izzy, with a vast social media following of her own — have chosen to post anyway, satisfying a demand that can reach millions of views within days.\nIzzy Darnell — who wouldn’t share her choices for sorority ahead of Saturday’s bid day — said her older sister’s acumen has equipped her to navigate criticism and potentially predatory business deals. But she worries about how other girls might handle the fame and money.\n“I just fear what some girls will do because they think they have to,” Izzy Darnell said.",

Finding 1,000 of them in a single recovery is both rare and extraordinary.”\nGuttuso’s team employs dive crews and a fleet of boats and uses underwater metal detection-devices, plus hand-fanning of sand or sand suction to comb the sea floor, according to a public notice for a federal permit application the company filed.\nLast year, Florida officials announced they had recovered dozens of gold coins stolen by salvagers from the wreck. The suspect was identified as a family member of the team contracted by 1715 Fleet – Queens Jewels LLC to work the site.\nUnder Florida law, any “treasure trove” or other historic artifacts “abandoned” on state-owned lands or in state waters belong to the state, though excavators can be permitted to carry out “recovery services.” The law requires that roughly 20% of the recovered archaeological materials be retained by the state for research collections or public display.\nGuttuso told The Associated Press his team develops a detailed inventory of all the artifacts collected each season to be reviewed by the state. Florida officials select up to 20% of the items to keep for the public, in a negotiation process that is ultimately approved by a federal court. Remaining artifacts are split equally among the salvage company’s owners and its subcontractors, Guttuso said.\n“We want to do it right,” Guttuso said.\n“And it benefits the people of Florida. They end up in the museums,” he said of the treasures.\n___ Kate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "body": "The Dubai chocolate craze is now about much more than bars\nThe Dubai chocolate craze is now about much more than bars\nNEW YORK (AP) — Some flavor crazes flirt with us and fade. Others stay and make themselves at home.\nIt’s too soon to tell for sure, but the Dubai chocolate movement seems to have put down roots and is spreading at a brisk clip. The sweet flavors and thick texture that have made Dubai chocolate bars a hit are morphing into other kinds of confections too.\nLet’s back up for a minute. The original and now-classic Dubai chocolate bar was created by Fix Chocolatier in the United Arab Emirates in 2021, and by 2023 had exploded on social media. Rich and indulgent, it features a thick, milk chocolate shell usually encasing a creamy pistachio (and often tahini) filling mixed with crispy, shredded, phyllo-like pastry called kadayif.\nGlobal brands and small bakers alike are riffing on the concept, translating it to croissants, milkshakes and more. Fillings range from peanut butter and jelly to s’mores to matcha.\n“I don’t call this a ‘trend’ anymore — it’s a whole new thing,” said Din Allall, whose family business, The Nuts Factory, has about 150 U.S. stores featuring nuts, dried fruits and candies.\nThe craze has even contributed to a pistachio shortage this year, the Iranian nut producer Keinia has reported. It said the primary reason for the shortage is “the explosive surge in demand fueled by the viral ’Dubai chocolate’ TikTok trend, compounded by underlying supply constraint.”\nGlobally, Google searches for “Dubai chocolate” shot up quickly at the start of the year before peaking in March. They’ve remained elevated since then, according to Google Trends.\nAllall carries 12 flavors of Dubai chocolate bar, as well as chocolate- and pistachio-covered Dubai dates, Dubai-coated roasted nuts, a layered Dubai chocolate strawberry parfait, and a Dubai Golden Chocolate bar infused with edible 24-karat gold for $79.99 (their regular 6.5-ounce bars sell for $18.99).\nIt’s not just the flavors that make Dubai chocolate different, Allall says, but the bar’s structure too — “huge, thick, with lots of filling.”\nBig retailers and restaurants have gotten on board\nTrader Joe’s carries a Dubai chocolate bar made by Patislove. IHOP introduced a limited-time Dubai pancake stack in some locations in August. Baskin-Robbins has some Dubai-inspired ice cream products on its menu, while Costco sells a range of Dubai chocolate confections, including a Dubai chocolate cake. Walmart and QVC also sell Dubai chocolate.\nSwiss chocolate giant Lindt has a bar, and drew crowds when it debuted a limited number of them in Europe last fall.\n“For me, it’s the crunch,” said Erica Lefkowits, who was buying some Dubai chocolate recently in Dublin. “The chocolate is soft and melty, and the filling is creamy, and then the crunch of the kadayif. It’s all about the texture. Plus, it’s sugar.”\nShe was a little annoyed at the price, higher than your average chocolate bar. Part of Dubai chocolate’s appeal, though, is the way it feels simultaneously indulgent and worldly. Pistachios, rose, saffron and cardamom bring luxury, travel and exoticism to the chocolate party.\nIn the U.S., Dubai chocolate is still a relatively niche product. In the 52 weeks ending June 28, U.S. retail sales of pistachio-filled chocolate totaled $822,900, according to the market research company NielsenIQ. By comparison, sales of all chocolates totaled $16.27 billion.\nStill, demand for Dubai chocolate is growing much faster than demand for other varieties. Unit sales of pistachio-filled chocolates were up 1,234% compared to the previous year, NielsenIQ said, while unit sales of all chocolates fell less than 1%.\nDespite the price, “I’ve never seen a single item sell like this in my 50 years of retailing,” said Stew Leonard, Jr., CEO of Stew Leonard’s grocery stores in the New York metropolitan area. The chain introduced the BeeMax Dubai chocolate bar in March, watched it fly out the doors, he said, and then launched their own house-branded version (made by the company Chocopologie).\nThey’ve introduced a Dubai chocolate gift box for the holidays, which includes teeny Dubai ice cream cones, Dubai pralines and two bars.\nSome other widely distributed brands in the U.S. are Moda, Magno and Leonessa. Other iterations of Dubai chocolate include Chocolove’s little candies and Matteo’s Coffee Syrups’ sugar-free chocolate coffee syrup.\n___\nKatie Workman writes regularly about food for The Associated Press.

(AP) — When Ukrainian immigrant Alex Babich stands in his Indiana backyard craning his neck to look 35 feet (11 meters) into the sky, he isn’t just staring at a sunflower. He is looking at his roots — and his future legacy.\nThe flower, nicknamed “Clover” and confirmed Wednesday by Guinness World Records as the tallest sunflower ever measured, stretches as high as a telephone pole.\nAchieving the feat holds special significance for the 47-year-old Babich since sunflowers are the national flower of Ukraine.\nBorn and raised in Ukraine, he immigrated to the U.S. at age 14 in 1991 after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Seven years ago, he started growing sunflowers as a symbol of his love for his home country. Babich’s first sunflower was 13 feet (4 meters) tall, then 15 (4.5), then 19 (5.8). Quickly, he began asking himself, “How far can we take this?” Babich said the record-breaking flower was the result of “trial and error over years.”\n“It’s one of my kids,” he said. “You’re out there every day taking care of it.”\nBabich’s 10-year-old son also had an important contribution that earned the towering flower its name. He would climb onto the scaffolding and place four-leaf clovers on the sunflower’s leaves, for good luck.\n“I’m going to die someday, but the stories of this flower will live on,” he said. “My kids will be telling this story to the grandkids.”\nWhen measuring day came on Sept. 3, Babich was nervous.\nAbout 85 people had gathered to watch, including several master gardeners from a local university and representatives from the Allen County Department of Weights and Measures. Babich was on a WhatsApp call with a representative from Guinness World Records. A camera crew was filming, and a drone flew overhead. Even Icy D. Eagle, the mascot of the Fort Wayne Komets minor league ice hockey team, was there, according to Guinness.\nThey used a 40-foot cherry picker to measure the flower. Clover was 35 feet (11 meters) and 9 inches (22.9 centimeters), 5 feet (1.5 meters) taller than the previous world record holder in Germany.\n“It’s very emotional,” Babich said. “It’s as good as it gets for someone who grows giants.”\nGrowing up amid food shortages in Ukraine sparked Babich’s love for gardening. His affection for sunflowers deepened after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n“We just pray that the war will end, that the killing will stop,” Babich said. “We just hope this inspires some people in the right places. It’s been long enough.”\nThe sunflower has long been a national symbol representing peace in Ukraine, and since 2022, it has become a symbol of solidarity with the embattled country. In one viral video clip in the war’s early days, a Ukrainian woman confronted a Russian soldier, ultimately offering to “put sunflower seeds in your pocket so they grow when you die.”\nIn 1996, ministers from the U.S., Russia and Ukraine planted sunflowers at the Pervomaysk missile base to mark the country’s nuclear weapon disarmament. In 1986, after the explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant that later brought Babich’s family to the U.S., scientists planted sunflowers to remove toxins from the soil.\nBabich’s sunflower will soon be the star of a documentary, titled “Bloom,” planned for release this summer. In the meantime, Babich has started planting sunflowers around campsites he visited with his family and passing out seed packets to children at festivals.\nPlastered onto the seed packets are stickers with the words “Spread the love – sunflower seeds.”\n___\nFernando reported from Chicago.",

(AP Video by John Leicester)\nOUISTREHAM, France (AP) — The captain of the giant Royal Navy battleship called his officers together to give them a first morsel of one of World War II’s most closely guarded secrets: Prepare yourselves, he said, for “an extremely important task.”\n“Speculations abound,” one of the officers wrote in his diary that day — June 2, 1944. “Some say a second front, some say we are to escort the Soviets, or doing something else around Iceland. No one is allowed ashore.”\nThe secret was D-Day — the June 6, 1944, invasion of Nazi-occupied France with the world’s largest-ever sea, land and air armada. It punctured Adolf Hitler’s fearsome “Atlantic Wall” defenses and sped the dictator’s downfall 11 months later.\nThe diary writer was Lam Ping-yu — a Chinese officer who crossed the world with two dozen comrades-in-arms from China to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe.\nFor 32-year-old Lam, watching the landings in Normandy, France, unfold from aboard the battleship HMS Ramillies proved to be momentous.\nHis meticulously detailed but long-forgotten diary was rescued by urban explorers from a Hong Kong tenement block which was about to be demolished. It is bringing his story back to life and shedding light on the participation of Chinese officers in the multinational invasion.\nAs survivors of the Battle of Normandy disappear, Lam’s compelling firsthand account adds another vivid voice to the huge library of recollections that the World War II generation is leaving behind, ensuring that its sacrifices for freedom and the international cooperation that defeated Nazism aren’t forgotten.\n“Saw the army’s landing craft, as numerous as ants, scattered and wriggling all over the sea, moving southward,” Lam wrote on the evening of June 5, as the invasion fleet steamed across the English Channel.\n“Everyone at action stations. We should be able to reach our designated location around 4-5 a.m. tomorrow and initiate bombardment of the French coast,” he wrote.\nBreakthroughs\nSleuthing by history enthusiasts Angus Hui and John Mak in Hong Kong pieced together the story of how Lam found himself aboard HMS Ramillies and proved vital in verifying the authenticity of his 80-page diary, written in 13,000 wispy, delicate Chinese characters.\nHui and Mak have curated and are touring an exhibition about Lam, his diary and the other Chinese officers — now on display in the Normandy town of Ouistreham.\nOne breakthrough was their discovery, confirmed in Hong Kong land records, that the abandoned 9th-floor flat where the diary was found had belonged to one of Lam’s brothers.\nAnother was Hui’s unearthing in British archives of a 1944 ship’s log from HMS Ramillies. A May 29 entry recorded that two Chinese officers had come aboard. Misspelling Lam’s surname, it reads: “Junior Lieut Le Ping Yu Chinese Navy joined ship.”\nLost, found and lost again\nLam’s leather-bound black notebook has had a dramatic life, too.\nLost and then found, it has now gone missing again. Hui and Mak say it appears to have been squirreled away somewhere — possibly taken to the U.S. or the U.K. by people who emigrated from Hong Kong — after the explorers riffled through the apartment, salvaging the diary, other papers, a suitcase, and other curios, before the building was demolished.\nBut Hui, who lived close by, got to photograph the diary’s pages before it disappeared, preserving Lam’s account.\n“I knew, ‘Okay, this is a fascinating story that we need to know more about,’” he says.\n“Such a remarkable piece of history ... could have remained buried forever,” Mak says.\nThey shared Lam’s account with his daughter, Sau Ying Lam, who lives in Pittsburgh. She previously knew very little about her father’s wartime experiences. He died in 2000.\n“I was flabbergasted,” she says. “It’s a gift of me learning who he was as a young person and understanding him better now, because I didn’t have that opportunity when he was still alive.”\nA lucky escape\nLam was part of a group of more than 20 Chinese naval officers sent during World War II for training in the U.K. by Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang led a Nationalist government in China from 1928 to 1949, fighting invasion by Japan and then Mao Zedong’s communists, before fleeing to Taiwan with the remnants of his forces when Mao’s insurgents took power.\nOn their long journey from China, the officers passed through Egypt — a photo shows them posing in front of the pyramids in their white uniforms — before joining up with British forces.\nIn his diary, Lam wrote of a narrow brush with death on D-Day aboard HMS Ramillies, as the battleship’s mighty guns were pounding German fortifications with massive 880-kilogram (1,938-pound) shells before Allied troops hit the five invasion beaches.\n“Three torpedoes were fired at us,” Lam wrote. “We managed to dodge them.”\nHis daughter marvels at the lucky escape.\n“If that torpedo had hit the ship, I wouldn’t be alive,” she says.\nThrough ships’ logs, Hui and Mak say they’ve confirmed that at least 14 Chinese officers participated in Operation Neptune — the 7,000-vessel naval component of the invasion which was code-named Operation Overlord — and other Allied naval operations as the Battle of Normandy raged on after D-Day.\nOperation Dragoon\nSome of the officers, including Lam, also saw action in the Allied invasion of southern France that followed, in August 1944.\n“Action stations at 4 a.m., traces of the moon still visible, although the horizon is unusually dark,” Lam wrote on Aug. 15. “Bombardment of the French coast started at 6, Ramillies didn’t open fire until 7.\n“The Germans put up such a feeble resistance, one can call it nonexistent.”\nFrance awarded its highest honor, the Légion d’honneur, to the Chinese contingent’s last survivor in 2006. Huang Tingxin, then 88, dedicated the award to all those who traveled with him from China to Europe, saying “it was a great honor to join the anti-Nazi war,” China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported at the time.\nLam’s daughter says their story remains inspirational.\n“It talks about unity, talks about hard work, about doing good,” she says. “World War II, I think it shows us that we can work together for common good.”\n___\nLeung reported from Hong Kong.",

Without them Earth would be heading to an additional 114 days a year of those deadly extra hot days, the same study found.\nThe international collection of climate scientists World Weather Attribution and the U.S.-based Climate Central teamed up to use computer simulations to calculate just how much of a difference the landmark accord has made in terms of one of the biggest climate effects on people: heat waves.\nThe report — which is not yet peer-reviewed but uses established techniques for climate attribution — calculated how many superhot days the world and more than 200 countries got in 2015, how many Earth gets now and what’s projected in two future scenarios.\nOne scenario is if countries fulfill their promises to curb emissions and by the year 2100 the world warms 2.6 Celsius (4.7 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial times. That adds 57 superhot days to what Earth gets now, according to the study. The other scenario is the 4 C (7.2 F) of warming that the world had been on track to hit before the Paris agreement. The study found that would double the number of additional hot days.\nPain and suffering coming\n“There will be pain and suffering because of climate change,” said Climate Central Vice President for Science Kristina Dahl, a report co-author. “But if you look at this difference between 4 degrees C of warming and 2.6 degrees C of warming, that reflects the last 10 years and the ambitions that people have put forth. And to me, that’s encouraging.”\nNearly 200 nations gather next month in Brazil for international climate negotiations. Numerous groups of scientists, analysts and advocates are compiling reports that show the same mixed bag: The 2015 Paris agreement has made strides in the fight against climate change but it’s too little and too slow.\nNorthern Illinois University climate scientist Victor Gensini said Thursday’s hot day findings “highlight both the success and shortfall of the Paris Agreement.”\nThe study defines superhot days for each location as days that are warmer than 90% of the comparable dates between 1991 and 2020. Since 2015, the world has already added 11 superhot days on average, the report said.\n“That heat sends people to the emergency room. Heat kills people,” Dahl said.\nThe report doesn’t say how many people will be affected by the additional dangerously hot days, but co-author Friederike Otto of Imperial College London said that “it will definitely be tens of thousands or millions, not less.” She noted that thousands die in heat waves each year already.\nImagine recent heat waves but worse\nThursday’s study calculated that the weeklong southern Europe heat wave in 2023 is now 70% more likely and 0.6 C (1.1 F) warmer than it would have been 10 years ago when the Paris agreement was signed. And if the world’s climate-fighting efforts don’t increase, a similar heat wave at the end of the century could be 3 C (5.4 F) hotter, the report estimated.\nA heat wave similar to last year’s Southwestern United States and Mexico heat wave could be 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter by the end of the century under the current carbon pollution trajectory, the report said.\nOther groups are also finding more than hundreds of thousands of deaths from recent heat waves in peer-reviewed research with much of it because of human-caused climate change, said University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi, who wasn’t part of Thursday’s report.\nMore than anything, the data shows how unfair the effects of climate change seem, even under the less extreme of the two scenarios. The scientists broke down how many extra superhot days are expected for each country by the end of the century under that scenario.\nCountry data shows high heat inequality\nThe 10 countries that will see the biggest increases in those dangerous heat days are nearly all small and dependent on the ocean, including the Solomon Islands, Samoa, Panama and Indonesia. Panama, for example, can expect 149 extra superhot days. Altogether the top 10 of those countries produced only 1% of the heat-trapping gases now in the air but will get nearly 13% of the additional superhot days.\nBut top carbon polluting countries, the United States, China and India are predicted to get only between 23 and 30 extra superhot days. They are responsible for 42% of the carbon dioxide in the air, but are getting less than 1% of the additional superhot days.\n“This report beautifully and tangibly quantifies what we’ve been saying for decades. The impacts of global warming are going to disproportionally affect developing nations that historically haven’t emitted significant quantities of greenhouse gases,” said University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who wasn’t part of the study team. “Global warming is driving yet another wedge between have and have not nations; this will ultimately sow seeds of further geopolitical instability.”\nHawaii and Florida are the U.S. states that will see the biggest increase in superhot days by the end of the century under the current carbon pollution trajectory, while Idaho will see the smallest jump, the report found.\nWhile the report makes sense, Potsdam Climate Institute Director Johan Rockstrom, who wasn’t part of the research, said people shouldn’t be relieved that we are no longer on the 4-degree warming pre-Paris trajectory because the current track “would still imply a disastrous future for billions of humans on Earth.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "‘Gen Z’ protesters lead global wave of generational discontent\n‘Gen Z’ protesters lead global wave of generational discontent\nNEW DELHI (AP) — From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.\nThis week, Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as “Gen Z Madagascar.”\nThe rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.\nBut they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as “Gen Z,” defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 — the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.\nFrom Madagascar to Nepal, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people. Here’s what to know about these Gen Z protests.\n“What connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren’t responsive to their generation’s concerns, whether that’s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,” said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.\nProtesters take cues from each other\nThough their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.\nIn Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 — named after Morocco’s dialing code — has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers’ perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.\nThe most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a “Gen Z” protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia — Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 — which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.\nIn Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.\nThe protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar’s military coup leader said he is “taking the position of president.”\nUniting behind a manga pirate flag\nAcross multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called “One Piece,” which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.\nIn Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.\nLast week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Martín Square, now the stage for weekly protests.\n“We’re fighting the same battle — against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,” he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte’s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.\n“In my case, it’s outrage over abuse of power, corruption, the deaths,” Tafur said, referring to the sharp rise in murders and extortion plaguing the South American country since 2017, amid new laws that have weakened efforts to fight crime.\nBoluarte had been under investigation for months over various allegations including bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022. She was replaced last week by interim President José Jerí.\nTafur said that wasn’t enough.\n“The president is an ally of Congress and has to go,” he said.\nHarnessing social media for mobilization and awareness\nMany significant protests in the past, like Occupy Wall Street in 2011, the Arab Spring between 2010 and 2012, and the 2014 Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong, have been led by younger people. While they also used the internet and social media for mass mobilization, the “Gen Z” protesters are taking it to another level.\n“Digital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we’ve seen in these recent protests,” said Nadel from Social Change Lab.\nDays before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.\nOver the next few days, they used TikTok, Instagram and X to spotlight the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children, highlighting disparities between Nepal’s rich and poor, and announce planned rallies and venues. Later, some of them also used the gaming chat platform Discord to suggest who to nominate as an interim leader for the country.\n“Whatever movement happens, whether against corruption or injustice, it spreads through digital media. The same happened in Nepal. The changes that took place after the Gen Z protests in Nepal spread globally through digital platforms, influencing other countries as well,” said protester Yujan Rajbhandari.\nHe said the protests in Nepal awakened not only the youth but also other generations.\n“We realized that we are global citizens and the digital space connects us all and plays a powerful role across the world,” Rajbhandari said.\n———\nAssociated Press journalists Franklin Briceño in Lima, Peru, and Niranjan Shrestha in Kathmandu, Nepal, contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Drought has muted this year’s leaf-peeping season, but pockets of brilliant colors remain\nDrought has muted this year’s leaf-peeping season, but pockets of brilliant colors remain\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have muted this year’s autumn colors, and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.\nSoaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.\nBut dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that’s happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.\nThat’s more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and Western U.S. especially hard, he said.\nIt all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.\n“I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,” Rippey said. “The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.”\nFewer leaves, but many peepers\nDespite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it’s still a great year to get out and enjoy nature’s fireworks display. Yellows and reds are popping in popular destinations including Franconia Notch State Park in New Hampshire and Ricketts Glen State Park in Pennsylvania.\nThere is still a lot of color in New England’s trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.\nClimate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.\n“Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,” Finton said. “They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.”\n___\nWatch an AP livestream of fall foliage around the Northeast on Tuesday.\n___\nThe tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that has been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.\nBeckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.\n“This year is actually going to be better than last year,” Beckwith said. “Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know who’s president now and we are traveling.”\nChris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country’s best leaf peeping seasons.\n“This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,” Proulx said.\nMuted show in the Rocky Mountains\nLeaf peeping was so popular in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.\nBut there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, which was more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.\nCrispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.\n“The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,” he said.\nIn Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he’s seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It’s still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.\n“It’s weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,” he said. “Usually we’re later in October before we really go off.”\n___\nCasey reported from Boston.

    "body": "A look at some world leaders who have fled uprisings\nA look at some world leaders who have fled uprisings\nJOHANNESBURG (AP) — Many supposedly invincible leaders have been forced to flee their countries or have gone into hiding to avoid incarceration, execution, or political retaliation by successor governments due to revolutions, military coups or mass protests.\nThe most recent international leader to join the list is Andry Rajoelina, the president of Madagascar, who was overthrown in a military coup this week. His fall came after weeks of Gen Z-led demonstrations over hardship, lack of opportunities and power shortages in the Indian Ocean island nation.\nHere’s a look at other leaders who have succumbed to a similar fate.\nBashar Assad\nIn 2024, former Syrian leader Bashar Assad fled to Russia as rebels advanced toward the capital Damascus to take over power after years of civil war.\nAs opposition forces swept across the country, Assad arrived in Moscow, bringing an end to 51 years of his family’s rule over the country.\nFor years, Assad enjoyed backing from allies Russia and Iran, who supported him throughout a 13-year civil war against opposition forces.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin granted protection to him, his family and some associates, and has refused to extradited him to Syria.\nSheikh Hasina\nIn August 2024, Bangladesh’s longest-serving prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, was forced to resign and flee the country after waves of protests managed to topple her government.\nThe U.N. human rights office estimates that as many as 1,400 people were killed when security forces cracked down on the student-led protests that lasted for weeks.\nHasina, who is still in exile in India, first became prime minister in 1996 and then returned in 2008 to win the office she held until her resignation.\nHer father, Sheikh Mujib Rahman, was the first leader of an independent Bangladesh. He was assassinated in a military coup in 1975.\nGotabaya Rajapaksa\nAfter months of protests over a devastating economic crisis, Sri Lanka’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in July 2022 for the Maldives, only to return about two months later.\nThe South Asian island nation’s economic collapse left it short of cash to pay for food and fuel imports, put its debt in default, and forced people to queue for days for cooking gas and petrol.\nSri Lankans blamed Rajapaksa, who was part of a powerful family political dynasty, for the disaster.\nHe was forced to resign, along with his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa who was prime minister, and two other brothers and a nephew who served in his Cabinet.\nViktor Yanukovych\nIn February 2014, following a series of deadly protests, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled the capital city of Kyiv and eventually reemerged in Russia.\nThe protests in Kyiv were sparked by Yanukovych’s shelving of an agreement with the European Union in November and turning instead for a $15 billion bailout loan from Russia. Yanukovych and opposition leaders would strike a deal aimed at bringing Ukraine’s political crisis to an end but he secretly fled the capital that evening.\nUkrainian MPs voted to impeach him and hold early presidential elections while an arrest warrant was issued for him following the protests which led to the deaths of dozens of civilians.\nPutin and Yanukovych would later state that Russian forces helped Yanukovych fly to Russia via Crimea.\nMoammar Gadhafi\nLibyan leader Moammar Gadhafi lost his four-decade grip on power during the 2011 Libyan Civil War, which was part of the wider Arab Spring uprisings.\nRebel forces overthrew Gadhafi after capturing the capital city of Tripoli, forcing him to flee with a handful of loyalists. He hid for weeks amid a bloody siege by rebel forces in his hometown of Sirte, one of the last strongholds of loyalist resistance.\nGadhafi tried to flee the besieged city on Oct. 20, 2011, with a convoy of loyalist fighters, but they were dispersed after being struck by a NATO air attack. Opposition forces then located Gadhafi in a big drainage pipe and captured him.\nFollowing his death, his body was on public display for a few days before being buried in a secluded desert site.\nMarc Ravalomanana\nMarc Ravalomanana served as Madagascar’s sixth president from 2002 to 2009 until he was overthrown by a military coup led by none other than Rajoelina, who was at the time the former mayor of Antananarivo, the capital.\nRavalomanana transferred his power to a military council and fled to South Africa.\nThe international community deemed it a coup and withdrew all but humanitarian aid.\nRavalomanana was later convicted in absentia of conspiracy to commit murder in a case related to the violence during his overthrow. He was sentenced to life in prison after a trial described as “unfair” by Amnesty International.\nAfter more than five years of exile, he returned to Madagascar and was arrested at his home. The following year, his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest.\nJean-Bertrand Aristide\nFormer Haiti President Jean-Bertrand Aristide twice fled his country during military coups, the first one six months after he became the Caribbean island’s first democratically elected leader in 1991.\nHis reforms angered the military elite, and he fled to Venezuela when his government fell. He was reinstated to finish his term from 1994 to 1996 with help from the United States.\nAristide won election again in 2000 but by 2004 the country was in turmoil and he was forced to resign, with his administration facing popular rebellion.\nAristide fled for the second time, leaving Haiti in a U.S.-chartered plane to the Central African Republic and later settling in South Africa. He returned to Haiti in 2011.",

The painting’s exact year of creation is not known but experts believe it dates back to around 1900.\nIn the opening scene of the video for the hit song “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift slips into the role of Ophelia and becomes a living painting.\nThe scene shows similarities to the work of Heyser, museum director Andreas Henning told German news agency dpa.\nHirschmann said the museum team recognized the resemblance earlier this month and decided to invite Swifties for a special tour next month. Once they had posted an announcement of the tour on their website, news of the Ophelia painting soon went viral online.\n“We’re really enjoying this attention — it’s a lot of fun,” Hirschmann told the AP, adding that all fans showing up for the Nov. 2 tour “Taylor Swift’s ‘Ophelia’ at the Wiesbaden museum” dressed as the pop star or as “the tragic beauty Ophelia” will be able to attend the tour for free.\nThere’s just one problem: the tour is already completely booked, so the museum may just have to add additional tours for all art-crazed Swiftie fans.\nHenning said the museum has already tried to contact the singer, but has had no success so far getting a hold of the world star. “I would love to show Taylor Swift the original painting sometime,” he said.\n“We are surprised and delighted that Taylor Swift used this painting from the museum as inspiration for her video,” Henning said. “This is, of course, a great opportunity to attract people to the museum who don’t know us yet.”\nThe museum said it does not know for sure if the art work served as a template for Swift’s song, which is currently a No. 1 hit both in Germany and the United States.",

    "body": "Jafar Panahi doesn’t want to be called a hero. He just wants to make films\nJafar Panahi doesn’t want to be called a hero. He just wants to make films\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi has been imprisoned, banned from traveling, put under house arrest and ordered to stop making films for 20 years. And, yet, Panahi has continually made films. Many of them rank among the greatest of the century.\nMost would call that courageous. Not Panahi.\n“My problem was that I was told not to make films. I had to make films. It’s very simple,” Panahi says. “I can come and claim I make things for my masses, for my people, for my country. No, I’m just looking for ways to make films.\n“I looked for solutions and I found them.”\nAnd, since he was first jailed in 2009, Panahi has found some extraordinary solutions. He made “Taxi” (2015) largely inside a car, serving as driver himself. “This Is Not a Film” (2011), he made in his living room, on an iPhone.\nTo evade authorities, the 65-year-old Panahi has often had to direct scenes remotely, or switch locations on a near-daily basis. His latest, “It Was Just an Accident,” was made clandestinely in Iran following a seven-month stint in prison that only ended in 2023 once Panahi went on a hunger strike. He made the movie, opening in the U.S. this week, inspired by the stories his fellow prisoners told.\nFrom Evin Prison to Cannes\nIn “It Was Just an Accident,” an anguished revenge thriller, a former prisoner spots in Tehran the man he thinks was his abusive interrogator in jail. But because he was blindfolded during interrogations — like Panahi, himself, was — he’s not sure. With the man gagged and bound in the back of his van, he drives to other former prisoners, and they debate what to do.\n“At the end of the day, I was a special person there,” Panahi, in a recent interview in Manhattan, said through an interpreter of his time in Evin Prison. “There were people there who would go on hunger strikes for 20 or 30 days and no one would hear about it. If I didn’t eat for two days, the entire world would find out.”\nPanahi has long been one of the most acclaimed filmmakers in movies, but he’s been absent from the world stage for more than 15 years. In that time, film festivals have sometimes reserved an open seat for him, with a “Jafar Panahi” placard.\nAfter being released in 2023, Panahi’s travel ban was lifted. He still made “It Was Just an Accident” underground, refusing to request government approval for his script. In one instance, during a night shoot when Panahi wasn’t present, his crew was detained by police.\nBut for the first time in nearly two decades, Panahi is able to travel with his film. At the Cannes Film Festival in May, he won the Palme d’Or. Accepting the prize on stage, he implored: “No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society.”\nFeted abroad, firmly rooted in Iran\nWith heightened concerns over censorship in other countries, Panahi has been given a hero’s welcome abroad. At the New York Film Festival, where his arrival was delayed by visa complications due to the travel ban implemented in June for visitors from 12 countries, Martin Scorsese hailed Panahi as one of the most important filmmakers working.\nYet Panahi doesn’t consider himself a hero, and dislikes being labeled a political filmmaker. For him, it’s more simple.\n“In cinema, it’s typical for people to constantly be looking for reasons not to work,” Panahi says. “I kept saying: I am a filmmaker. I have to make films. And it is my right to make films.”\nPanahi, like other filmmakers working under authoritarian regimes, has tested Oscar regulations. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences mandates that all nominees for best international film be submitted by a country. As expected, Iran didn’t select “It Was Just an Accident.” Instead, France made Panahi’s film, which was co-produced in France, its submission.\nPanahi, though, would rather see governments taken out of the process entirely.\n“If we want to send a film to Cannes or Venice or elsewhere, we don’t have an issue,” he says. “But as soon as we’re talking about the Oscars, we have to go and beg our governments.”\nStill, Panahi has refused to flee Iran. He loves his country, he says, and knows emigrant life isn’t for him. His friend and countryman, Mohammad Rasoulof last year dramatically fled Iran on foot in order to resettle in Germany and premiere “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” in Cannes. But Panahi returned to Iran the day after winning the Palme.\n“It made many people happy but it also made the government officials unhappy,” says Panahi. “State officials used the same formula as before and considered us spies for the CIA and Israel. On the other hand, many people, especially the families of political prisoners and independent filmmakers, were very happy I returned.”\nNo morality lessons\nFollowing the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022, a wave of protests spread against the Iran’s mandatory hijab laws and treatment of women. Panahi was imprisoned at the time of the protests but took great inspiration from them. Several female actors in “It Was Just an Accident” appear in the film without hijabs.\n“I really don’t want to give morality lessons. I want to cause and create questions,” Panahi says. “I want to ask what happens in the future, and encourage people to think if we will respond to violence with violence.”\nPanahi first looked through a camera at age 10. He became fascinated with the ability to capture life around him, and saved up to buy his first camera. Though some of his friends favored landscapes, he preferred photographing people. “I found myself shooting the streets,” he recalls.\nIn the decades since, nothing has really changed for Panahi.\n“I haven’t created the darkness. The darkness is there and the problem is with the people who created the darkness,” says Panahi. “I’m just showing the reality.”\nAt the New York Film Festival, Panahi remembered something his father told him when he was a child that’s stuck with him ever since: “You’re not allowed to bow to anyone other than God.”",

    "body": "In ‘Mr. Scorsese,’ fitting a filmmaking titan into the frame\nIn ‘Mr. Scorsese,’ fitting a filmmaking titan into the frame\nNEW YORK (AP) — The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002’s “Gangs of New York.” Miller’s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film’s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.\n“He seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,” Miller recalls. “I was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.”\nThat remains much the same throughout Miller’s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In “Mr. Scorsese,” which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.\n“We talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,” Miller says, referencing Scorsese’s projects to come. “It’s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you’ve got it, and then it’s more and more and more.”\nScorsese’s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That’s a part of “Mr. Scorsese,” too, but Miller’s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions — of morality, faith and filmmaking — that have guided him.\n“Who are we? What are we, I should say?” Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. “Are we intrinsically good or evil?”\n“This is the struggle,” he adds. “I struggle with it all the time.”\nMiller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.\n“I explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives — collaborators, family,” Miller says. “Within a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, ‘Is this a job interview or a planning situation?’”\nScorsese’s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, “Italianamerican” (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995’s “A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies” and 1999’s “My Voyage to Italy,” have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.\nWhile the bulk of “Mr. Scorsese” are the director’s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese’s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore “Sally Gaga” Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro’s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in “Mean Streets.”\n“Cinema consumed him at such an early age and it never left him,” DiCaprio says in the film. “There will never be anyone like him again,” says Steven Spielberg.\nIt can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But “Mr. Scorsese” is a reminder how often that wasn’t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (“Taxi Driver,” “The Last Temptation of Christ”) he was drawn to.\n“He was fighting for every single film,” Miller says. “Cutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You’re up and you’re down, you’re dead, then alive.”\nFilm executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from “Mr. Scorsese” in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late ’70s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do “Rocky II” with United Artists unless they also made “Raging Bull.”\nFor Miller, whose films include “The Ballad of Jack and Rose” and “Maggie’s Plan,” being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect “Mr. Scorsese.” The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film’s editing. “In proximity to these film,” she says, “you start to breathe the air.”\nNearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was “The Insect Woman,” Japanese filmmaker Shōhei Imamura’s 1963 drama about three generations of women.\n“He’s still doing it,” Miller says. “He’s still sending me movies.”\n“Mr. Scorsese” recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller’s son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with “Anemone,” a film that marked her husband’s return from retirement. At the “Mr. Scorsese” premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.\n“You hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the ‘Last Waltz’ sequence,” Miller says. “There was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.”",

    "body": "Arizona executes a man for killing 4 members of a family in Phoenix in 1993\nArizona executes a man for killing 4 members of a family in Phoenix in 1993\nFLORENCE, Arizona (AP) — A man convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago in an act of revenge over stolen goods was put to death Friday in Arizona’s second execution of the year.\nRichard Kenneth Djerf, 55, died by lethal injection for the killings of Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who was in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.\nHis execution was the fourth in the country this week and the 39th of the year.\n“Those four innocent victims deserve justice, and their loved ones deserve closure,” said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office sought the execution.\nProsecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics and a gun from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.\nAuthorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat then stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them.\nDjerf declined to make any last statement. He did not put up any resistance but took a few heavy breaths and emitted a brief snoring sound after the lethal drugs were administered, John Barcello, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, said during a news conference Friday.\nNo representatives of the victims were present, Barcello said.\nIt took about 10 minutes for the execution team to insert the IV lines into his veins so the drugs could be administered. After the first of two pentobarbital shots were given, he made several sounds, including a grunt and puffing sound. About 15 minutes elapsed between the first pentobarbital shot and the declaration that he was dead.\nBarcello said Djerf’s veins “were not optimal” and it required a few attempts to successfully place the IV.\n“By all accounts the process went according to plan and without any incident,” Barcello said. A month ago, Djerf released a statement in which he acknowledged carrying out the killings and apologized for the pain he caused.\nArizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.\nThe state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.\nThere was a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by difficulties in obtaining the needed drugs and criticism that a 2014 execution was botched: Joseph Wood was injected with 15 doses of a two-drug combination over two hours, leading him to snort repeatedly and gasp hundreds of times before he died.\nExecutions resumed in 2022, and three prisoners were put to death that year. They were paused again in 2023 after Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered a review of the capital punishment protocol and Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to pursue any executions.\nThe review ended in November 2024, when Hobbs fired a retired federal magistrate she had appointed to examine execution procedures, and the state corrections department announced changes in the lethal injection team.\nArizona last carried out a death sentence in mid-March, executing Aaron Brian Gunches for the 2002 killing of Ted Price.\nWith Djerf’s execution, there are now 107 prisoners on Arizona’s death row.\nFive more executions are scheduled in the U.S. this year — two in Florida and one each in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.\n___\nBilleaud reported from Phoenix.",

    "body": "With no takers yet, White House meets with colleges still weighing an agreement with Trump\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The five universities that were still weighing President Donald Trump’s higher-education compact were asked to join a White House call Friday to discuss the proposed deal. By late Friday afternoon, one of the schools — the University of Virginia — had already declined to sign the agreement.\nThe meeting with university presidents, first reported by The Associated Press, was an “important step toward defining a shared vision,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a post on X. She called for “renewed commitment to the time-honored principles that helped make American universities great” and said she looked forward to more dialogue.\nThe White House has faced a flurry of rejections after inviting nine universities to become “initial signatories” of the so-called compact, which asked colleges to make commitments aligned with Trump’s political priorities in exchange for favorable access to research funding. It was the latest effort by Trump’s administration to bring to heel prestigious universities that conservatives describe as hotbeds of liberalism.\nThe White House asked university leaders to provide initial feedback on the compact by Oct. 20, yet as the deadline approaches, none has signed on to the document. Those that have not yet announced a decision are Dartmouth College, the University of Arizona, the University of Texas and Vanderbilt University. They did not immediately respond to questions about Friday’s call. Leaders of the University of Texas system previously said they were honored to be included, but other universities still weighing the deal have not indicated how they’re leaning.\nAfter the meeting, McMahon took a collaborative tone, speaking of ongoing discussions with universities and referencing continued federal funding.\n“American universities power our economy, drive innovation, and prepare young people for rewarding careers and fulfilling lives,” she said in the social media post. “With continued federal investment and strong institutional leadership, the higher education sector can do more to enhance American leadership in the world and build tomorrow’s workforce.”\nNo takers so far\nNevertheless, the University of Virginia on Friday became the fifth university to decline to participate in Trump’s compact. Providing federal money based on anything but merit would undermine the integrity of research and further erode public confidence in higher education, the university’s interim president said in a letter to McMahon and White House officials.\n“We look forward to working together to develop alternative, lasting approaches to improving higher education,” Paul Mahoney wrote.\nIt’s unclear exactly what universities have to gain by agreeing to the deal — or what they stand to lose if they don’t. In a letter sent alongside the compact, Trump officials said it provided “multiple positive benefits,” including favorable access to federal funding. In exchange, colleges were asked to adopt 10 pages of commitments aligned with Trump’s views.\nThe administration asked for commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman,” to promote conservative views on campus and to ensure “institutional neutrality” on current events, among other provisions.\n“Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,” the compact said.\nThe issue weighed on some students at Vanderbilt on Friday, with some worrying the university might sign the agreement even after student and faculty groups condemned it.\n“My major concern is just that this is like a first hook,” Marjolein Mues, a postdoctoral researcher in language development in the brain, said in an interview at the Nashville campus. “And once universities agree to this, the terms will change, and more and more will be asked of universities, and that maybe the government will start to interfere more with the types of research being done here.”\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first to decline the deal last week, saying it would limit free speech and campus independence. Similar concerns were cited in rejections from Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California.\nA push to change academia\nThe compact — which aims to reshape higher education through negotiation rather than legislation — has stirred a wave of pushback from academia and beyond. It has been protested by students, been condemned by faculty and drawn the ire of Democrats at all levels. Gov. Gavin Newsom in California and Democrats in Virginia have threatened to cut state funding to any university that signs on.\nIn a joint statement Friday, more than 30 higher education organizations urged the administration to withdraw the compact. Led by the American Council on Education, an association of research universities, the coalition said the agreement would give the government unprecedented control over colleges’ academics and hinder free speech.\n“The compact is a step in the wrong direction,” the statement said.\nMany of the terms align with recent deals the White House struck with Brown and Columbia universities to close investigations into alleged discrimination and to restore research funding. But while those agreements included terms affirming the campuses’ academic freedom, the compact offers no such protection — one of the roadblocks cited in Brown’s rejection.\nIn Trump’s ongoing quest to win obedience from powerful universities, his top target has been Harvard, the first university to openly defy a set of wide-ranging demands from the government. The White House went on to slash billions of dollars in research funding at Harvard, cancel its federal contracts and attempt to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students.\nA federal judge in Boston reversed the funding cuts last month, calling them an unconstitutional overreach.\nSeveral other prestigious universities have also had their funding cut amid investigations into alleged antisemitism.\nWhite House officials described the offer as a proactive approach to shape policy at U.S. campuses even as the administration continues its enforcement efforts.\nTrump on Sunday said colleges that sign on will help bring about “the Golden Age of Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” Speaking on his Truth Social platform, he said it would reform universities that are “now corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "As the shutdown drags on, these people will lose if health care subsidies expire\nMillions of Americans with Affordable Care Act marketplace health insurance will face higher costs next year if Congress doesn’t extend premium tax credits that have made the plans more affordable. (AP Video: Kendria LaFleur and Tassanee Vejpongsa).\nTYLER, Texas (AP) — Celia Monreal worries every day about the cartilage loss in her husband’s knees. Not just because it’s hard for her to see him in pain but also because she knows soon their health care costs could skyrocket.\nMonreal, 47, and her husband, Jorge, 57, rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. If Congress doesn’t extend certain ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of the year, their fully subsidized plan will increase in cost, putting it out of reach. Without insurance, they won’t be able to afford his expected knee replacement surgeries, much less the treatment they need for other issues, like her chronic high blood pressure and his high cholesterol.\n“It worries me sometimes, because if you’re not healthy, then you’re not here for your kids,” Monreal said. “It’s a difficult decision, because, OK, do I spend $500 on a doctor’s visit or do I buy groceries?”\nThose are the types of choices facing the millions of Americans whose state or federal marketplace health insurance plans will be up for renewal in November. The enhanced premium tax credits that have made coverage more affordable for low- and middle-income enrollees for the last four years will expire this year if Congress doesn’t extend them. On average, that will more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by health care research nonprofit KFF.\nThe tax credits are at the heart of the federal government shutdown, in its third week with no end in sight. Democrats have demanded the subsidies be extended as part of any funding deal they sign, while Republicans say they’ll only negotiate on the issue once the government is funded.\nWith Congress deadlocked and the open enrollment period for ACA plans approaching on Nov. 1 in most states, Americans like Monreal are left to navigate the unknown.\nNo extension will mean higher premiums for millions\nMore than 24 million people have ACA health insurance, a group including farmers, ranchers, small business owners and other self-employed people who don’t have other health insurance options through their work.\nThe enhanced premium tax credits set to expire this year have made costs far more manageable for many of them, allowing some lower-income enrollees to get health care with no premiums and higher earners to pay no more than 8.5% of their income.\nIf the tax credits expire, annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% — an average of $1,016 — next year, according to the KFF analysis.\nWhile some premium tax credits will remain, the level of support will decrease for most enrollees. Anyone earning more than 400% of the poverty level — or around $63,000 per year for a single person — won’t be eligible for the remaining tax credits.\nAs a result, especially hard-hit groups will include a small number of higher earners who’ll have to pay a lot more without the extra subsidies and a large number of lower earners who’ll have to pay a small amount more, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.\nWith higher premiums, some people will drop out of health insurance altogether, Cox said. When many younger, healthier people inevitably forgo coverage, insurance companies will increase costs for members of the covered population to account for them being older and sicker.\nThe change may also strain hospitals, since more uninsured people will need emergency care they can’t afford. That could lead to hospital closures or cost increases.\n“If you have less subsidies for people getting health insurance, you’re going to have less health coverage and less health care,” said Jason Levitis, a senior fellow in the health policy division at the Urban Institute. “People are going to be sicker and die more.”\nA caregiver braces for the worst. A filmmaker considers a new job\nErin Jackson-Hill has allergies, asthma and searing hip pain she’s managing with prescribed medications until she can get a hip replacement. But even with all those conditions, the 56-year-old in Anchorage, Alaska, doesn’t think she can pay for health insurance next year if the ACA subsidies aren’t extended.\nThe executive director of two nonprofits, who also cares for her 89-year-old father full time, already pays nearly $500 a month for her premiums. If the subsidies disappear, she plans to forgo health insurance and pay for her asthma and allergy medications out of pocket.\nJackson-Hill said she worries about what will happen if her hip worsens and she can’t make it up the stairs in her father’s two-story home without treatment.\n“I will have to go to the emergency room, or I’ll have to go bankrupt in order to pay for it,” she said.\nAnother ACA enrollee, Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, said he’ll find a way to pay for health insurance next year — even if it means he must buy cheaper groceries or get a new job that provides it.\nClawson, 49, has lived with paralysis below his abdomen since falling while rock climbing when he was 20. He’s active and generally healthy, but his spinal cord injury has resulted in tendonitis in his shoulders and frequent urinary tract infections.\nHe also has to buy catheters to use every time he urinates — a cost he said would add up to around $1,400 a month without insurance.\n“I don’t think a lot of people realize how expensive it is to have a disability,” Clawson said, adding that trying to live without health insurance would be “financially devastating.”\nChrissy Meehan, a hair stylist in Upper Chichester, Pennsylvania, has a neck condition that may require surgery. She says if ACA subsidies expire, she’ll further delay the procedure.\nThe 51-year-old voted for Republican Donald Trump for president last year, something she said she’s almost embarrassed about now that the Republican-led government hasn’t renewed the subsidies that help her afford her coverage through the state marketplace.\n“I work hard, and I’m trying to survive and do it the right way and pay my way,” Meehan said. “I don’t want free.

On their already tight $45,000 joint annual income, budgeting for themselves and their five children will become that much harder.\nThe concern over their budget and the uncertainty over their health care coverage send her thoughts into yet another worrisome spiral with just two weeks until open enrollment begins.\n“They haven’t told us nothing,” she said of her insurance provider. “And you know what?

    "body": "What to know about federal charges against former national security adviser John Bolton\nWhat to know about federal charges against former national security adviser John Bolton\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton turned himself in to federal authorities Friday morning in Maryland and pleaded not guilty after being indicted on charges of keeping top secret documents at his home and sharing classified information with family members.\nBolton was ordered released from custody after making his court appearance.\nHis criminal case is the third brought by the Justice Department in recent weeks against someone deemed adversarial to President Donald Trump. It also amplifies concerns that Trump is using the nation’s top law enforcement agency to punish political foes.\nBolton didn’t comment to reporters as he entered the federal courthouse in Greenbelt, about 13 miles (21 kilometers) northeast of Washington.\nBut he said Thursday in a statement after a grand jury returned the 18-count indictment against him that he has “become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.”\nHere is what to know about Bolton and the charges he faces:\nWho is John Bolton?\nThe 76-year-old Bolton is a longtime Republican who spent more than a year as a national security adviser during Trump’s first term.\nHis 17-month tenure was rife with clashes over countries including North Korea and Iran, with him voicing skepticism over Trump’s outreach toward and summit with Kim Jong Un. On Iran, Bolton backed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal but favored regime change and was frustrated when Trump called off a planned military strike in 2019.\nThe Republican president fired Bolton in 2019 and the two continued to clash in public comments long after Bolton left office.\nBolton’s book, “The Room Where It Happened,” was released in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election and was highly critical of Trump and his first term in the White House.\nThe Trump administration sued to block the book’s release, claiming it disclosed classified information, but the Justice Department under President Joe Biden abandoned the lawsuit in 2021.\nBolton’s Maryland home was searched in late August by federal agents.\nCharges levied against Bolton\nThe indictment, which was brought against Bolton on Thursday, also accuses him of sharing with his wife and daughter more than 1,000 pages of notes that included sensitive national defense information he had gleaned from meetings with other U.S. government officials and foreign leaders or from intelligence briefings. Authorities say some of the information was exposed when operatives believed to be linked to the Iranian government hacked Bolton’s email account he used to send the diary-like notes about his activities to his relatives.\n“Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday.\nThe indictment cited an April news media interview in which Bolton chastised Trump administration officials for using Signal to discuss sensitive military details.\nAuthorities say Bolton took meticulous notes about his meetings and briefings as national security adviser and then used a personal email account and messaging platform to share information classified as high as top secret with his family members.\nThe indictment also says that a Bolton representative told the FBI in July 2021 that his email account had been hacked by operatives believed to be linked to the Iranian government but did not reveal he had shared classified information through the account or that the hackers now had possession of government secrets.\nOther enemies of Trump targeted\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, was indicted earlier this month in a mortgage fraud case. She was charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a home purchase in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\nJames has sued Trump and his administration dozens of times. She won a staggering judgment last year against Trump and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements.\nAn appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court’s finding that Trump had committed fraud.\nFormer FBI Director James Comey was charged in September with lying to Congress. The charges against Comey followed Trump appearing to publicly urge Bondi to prosecute Comey and other perceived political enemies.\nComey had been involved in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, an investigation that Trump has claimed to be “hoax” and a “witch hunt” despite multiple government reviews showing Moscow interfered on behalf of the Republican’s campaign.\nComey was fired during Trump’s first term.",

    "body": "Daily struggles persist in Gaza even as ceasefire offers some respite\nDaily struggles persist in Gaza even as ceasefire offers some respite\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Bassil Naggar can finally sleep without getting jolted awake by the sounds of Israeli airstrikes.\nFor Naggar and his displaced family, and for many in Gaza facing similar challenges, the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war has provided a much-needed respite from a two-year war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left much of the territory in ruins.\nBut many daily struggles, big and small, persist — from how to put an actual roof over one’s head and what to wear as winter approaches, to how to secure proper food, to worries over whether the fragile ceasefire will hold.\nThe extent of some of the personal and communal losses has become clearer since the ceasefire went into effect on Oct. 10, allowing many to return to their neighborhoods and discover what remains of their homes.\n“Life after the ceasefire is still anxious. Is the war really over?” said Naggar, who has been displaced about a dozen times since the war began.\nFueling his fears are memories of the deadly Israeli airstrikes in March that shattered an earlier truce.\nIn the coastal area of Muwasi, crowded with displaced Palestinians, Naggar’s tent has started to wear thin. He said his home in eastern Khan Younis has been burned. He worries about how his family can keep warm in winter.\nThey’ve been surviving mostly on canned food, such as fava beans and chickpeas. He said he’s starting to see instant noodles and potato chips in the market. Prices have come down some, but remain too expensive, he added.\nThe World Food Program is moving “swiftly to scale up food assistance and reach families who have endured months of blockade, displacement and hunger,” spokesperson Abeer Etefa said Friday in Geneva.\n“We’re still below what we need, but we’re getting there,” Etefa said.\nChallenges she cited include damaged infrastructure and the need for more open crossings into Gaza.\nEarlier in the week, the entrance of desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza was paused for two days for the exchange of hostages and prisoners and for a Jewish holiday. Israel had also threatened to reduce the number of trucks allowed into Gaza, saying Hamas was too slow to return remaining bodies of hostages.\nUnder the ceasefire agreement, hundreds of trucks are to be allowed to enter Gaza daily. COGAT, the Israeli military body overseeing humanitarian aid, did not respond to a query about how many trucks carrying aid have made it into Gaza since the ceasefire.\nNaggar said he hasn’t noticed a significant change in the amount of aid available since the ceasefire started.\nIn the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people, and killed around 1,200.\nIn Israel’s ensuing offensive, nearly 68,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\nOn Thursday, hardships were on display at a crowded charity kitchen in the central city of Deir al-Balah, where scores of Palestinians held bowls and pots as they waited in front of large vats of rice. One woman displaced from Khan Younis, Fatima Shaat, said she waited for six hours for food.\nBasma Abu Al-Kheir said while some goods have come in, “there is no possibility of buying what we want” because prices are too high.\nIn Deir al-Balah, Fida Ziyad said tomatoes, cucumbers, and eggplants are available at the market, but poultry and meat are in short supply — and all of it costs more than it did before the war. Ziyad, who lost her home in northern Gaza, said she’s wary of what lies ahead, with many thorny issues about Gaza still unresolved.\nFor many, normalcy remains elusive.\nAfter the ceasefire, Mohamed Samy went back to check on his home in Jabaliya to find it reduced to rubble. Samy, who now lives in Gaza City, said much of his situation hasn’t changed since the ceasefire.\n“Even drinking water, I have to walk, sometimes up to an hour, to get to the water truck.”\nIn August, the world’s leading authority on food crises said Gaza City was gripped by famine, which the group warned then was likely to spread without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. At the time, Israel rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.”\nBefore then, aid groups had warned for months that Israel’s restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nSince the beginning of the ceasefire, at least nine humanitarian organizations have gradually resumed services in Gaza City and parts of northern Gaza for displaced families and returnees, according to a UN humanitarian affairs report released Thursday.\nIn Deir al-Balah, Ayman Abu Saif still relies on charity kitchens for food.\n“It’s either rice or pasta,” said Abu Saif, who once worked in the hospitality and restaurants fields and has been repeatedly displaced during the war.\n“The prices in the market are now more reasonable,” he said. That has led to a small win: He bought his children three apples for the first time in more than a year.\nHe remains uncertain about returning to where he lived in Gaza City, saying he saw a photo of his home destroyed. And it’s not just his home that’s gone.\n“There is no water and no infrastructure. I cannot go back even if I want to.”\nIn a glimpse of the challenges ahead, many displaced Palestinians returning to their neighborhoods found themselves walking through collapsed, pockmarked and hollowed out buildings and sifting through debris for traces of their past lives.\nAbu Saif laments the toll the war has taken on his children — and fears for their future.\n“It’s good that the bloodshed has stopped, but we have lost everything,” he said.\nHis six-year-old-son hasn’t received a proper education and probably won’t anytime soon, he said.\n“I do not want my kids to think that this is what life is, to run behind a charity kitchen to get food, or walk lengthy miles to get clean water,” said Abu Saif. “This is not reality and this is not what life is, and I am not sure life in Gaza will change soon.”\n—-\nFam reported from Cairo.

    "body": "Orbán celebrates Hungary as ‘the only place in Europe’ where a Trump-Putin meeting can be held\nBUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on Friday celebrated his country’s status as the host of upcoming talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, a meeting where the two leaders are expected to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine.\nTrump on Thursday announced his second meeting this year with Putin a day before he was to sit down with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. A date for the meeting has not been set, but Trump said it would take place in Hungary’s capital, Budapest, and suggested it could happen in about two weeks.\nHungary opposes the West’s support of Ukraine\nSpeaking to state radio on Friday, Orbán, a close Trump ally and considered Putin’s closest partner in the European Union, suggested that his long-standing opposition to the West supplying Ukraine with military and financial aid for its defense against Russia’s invasion had been crucial in making Budapest the site of the talks.\n“Budapest is essentially the only place in Europe today where such a meeting could be held, primarily because Hungary is almost the only pro-peace country,” Orbán said. “For three years, we have been the only country that has consistently, openly, loudly and actively advocated for peace.”\nOrbán, who has often taken an adversarial stance toward Ukraine and Zelenskyy, has consistently portrayed his position as pro-peace, while casting as warmongers his European partners that favor assisting Kyiv in its defense. Yet Orbán’s critics view Hungary’s position as favoring the aggressor in the war and splintering European unity in the face of Russian threats.\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Hungary, a NATO member, has refused to supply Ukraine with weapons or allow their transfer across its borders. Orbán has threatened to veto certain EU sanctions against Moscow and held up the bloc’s adoption of major funding packages to Kyiv.\nMeanwhile, Hungary has actively resisted weaning off Russian fossil fuels that help fund Moscow’s war, and, in contrast to almost all of the EU’s other 26 countries, has even increased its supplies since the 2022 invasion.\nPéter Krekó, director of the Political Capital think tank in Budapest, told The Associated Press he believes that the Trump-Putin talks being scheduled in Hungary — without the participation of any Ukrainian or EU officials — appeared to be a “huge victory” for Putin.\n“He can use the platform of a NATO country for these kinds of so-called peace negotiations, and around a table where no leaders are sympathetic toward Ukraine and no leaders seems to be very staunch defenders of the sovereignty of Ukraine,” Krekó said.\nOrganizing a meeting with Putin is complicated\nThe meeting in Budapest comes after Trump failed to secure an agreement to end the war in Ukraine during an August meeting with Putin in Alaska. Falling short of his campaign pledge to quickly stop the bloodshed, Trump rolled out the red carpet for the man who started it.\nA trip to Budapest for Putin would require him flying through the airspace of several NATO member countries, a potential complicating factor in organizing the meeting. Yet while Putin’s assets have been frozen by the EU, he is not subject to a travel ban in Europe. Russian planes are banned from entering the bloc, but member countries are permitted to allow certain flights in.\nHungary is also a signatory to the International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, Netherlands, which in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes. As a signatory, Orbán’s government would be required to arrest Putin if he set foot on Hungarian soil.\nHowever, Orbán said in April that his country would begin the process of withdrawing from the court after he gave red carpet treatment in Budapest to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also faced an ICC warrant on suspicion of crimes against humanity, which he denies.\nKrekó, the analyst, said Putin’s visit to Budapest would underline a common thread in the foreign policies of Trump, Putin and Orbán: “They are all hostile to multilateralism.”\n“The EU is irrelevant, NATO to a certain extent is irrelevant, the ICC is irrelevant. What matters is when strong men are sitting around the table and deciding over the fate of the world,” Krekó said.\nBudapest a symbolic location for talks\nBudapest hosting the Trump-Putin meeting also holds symbolic significance: It was in the Hungarian capital in 1994 that the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia granted Ukraine assurances of sovereignty and territorial integrity in exchange for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons.\nSergiy Gerasymchuk, deputy director of the Kyiv-based Ukrainian Prism think tank, said that many Ukrainians hold “negative associations” toward the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which has become a symbol of promises that carried no weight after Moscow shredded the agreement first with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then with the full-scale invasion in 2022.\nWhen hearing that the next round of Trump-Putin talks would take place in Hungary, Gerasymchuk said, “The first thing that came to my mind was, ‘Okay, another Budapest memorandum, another memorandum where Ukraine should give up its interests for nobody knows what.’”\nThe choice of Budapest as a venue, he continued, could be viewed as an attempt by Trump to provide a political boost for his ally Orbán, who is set to face the most challenging election of his last 15 years in power in April.\n“Bearing in mind that Viktor Orbán keeps his peacemaking image high on the agenda of the upcoming elections, (the talks) can be a success story,” Gerasymchuk said. “(Orbán) can finally prove that he has achieved something — if not peace in Ukraine, then at least a visit of world leaders to Budapest.”\nOn Friday, Orbán said that while the upcoming negotiations in Budapest were “not about Hungary,” the capital’s hosting of the meeting could be viewed as “a political achievement.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook contributed from Brussels.

    "body": "Gaza awaits the reopening of the Rafah border crossing, its link to the outside world\nGaza awaits the reopening of the Rafah border crossing, its link to the outside world\nCAIRO (AP) — Palestinians and aid workers are eagerly awaiting the reopening of the Rafah border crossing, which is the Gaza Strip’s lifeline for food and other aid and its only gateway to the outside world that wasn’t controlled by Israel before the war.\nThe crossing between Gaza and Egypt will probably reopen Sunday, Israel’s foreign minister said Thursday, though it wasn’t clear if it will be opened for both aid deliveries and the flow of people into and out of the territory.\nWith much of Gaza turned to rubble and gripped by famine, it needs a massive influx of fuel, food, medicine and tents. United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher said Thursday that he was headed to the crossing and hoped to see the route “full of trucks, as part of a massive surge of aid following the peace deal.”\nHere’s why the crossing is so vital.\nA ‘lifeline’ for Gaza\nBefore the war, Rafah bustled with goods and people passing to and from Egypt and Gaza, which is home to roughly 2.3 million Palestinians. Although Gaza has four other border crossings, they are shared with Israel, and only Rafah links the territory with another neighboring country.\nAfter Hamas-led militants invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage, Egypt tightened its restrictions on traffic through the Rafah crossing. After Israel took control of the Gaza side in May 2024 as part of its offensive that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, it closed the crossing except to the occasional medical evacuation.\nA reopened Rafah crossing would make it easier for Gazans to seek medical treatment, travel internationally or visit family in Egypt, which is home to tens of thousands of Palestinians. It would also help Gaza’s devastated economy, as Palestinian-made olive oil and other l products are widely sold in Egypt and throughout the Arab world.\nClosing the crossing was “breaking the backbone that many families relied on as a lifeline,” said Adel Amr, who works in the transport sector based in the West Bank and has been trying to organize aid shipments into Gaza.\n“The crossing is a lifeline for our families in Gaza. This was the only safe route for those who wanted to travel from the Gaza Strip to the outside world,” he said.\nWhat comes next?\nOn Wednesday, 400 truckloads of aid passed through the Egyptian side on their way into Gaza and headed through a buffer zone toward an Israeli-controlled crossing a few kilometers (miles) away. It’s unclear, though, if the aid made it through the Israeli security inspection and to those who desperately need it, though the World Food Program said some of its trucks have been getting through.\nThe Gaza side of the Rafah crossing was heavily damaged during the war, and it’s unknown if repairs are underway. Once it does reopen — perhaps as early as Sunday — Israel has agreed to stick to the humanitarian terms put in place for a January 2025 ceasefire, including allowing a certain number of truckloads of aid per day into Gaza.\nWith the ceasefire deal calling for Hamas to have no role in running Gaza, it’s unclear who will operate the territory’s side of the Rafah crossing once the war ends.\nWhoever it is, the crossing “should be run completely by Palestinians,” with some help from the U.N. or the European Union, said Sami al-Arian, a public affairs professor at Istanbul Zaim University who runs the Center for Islam and Global Affairs.\nThe EU said this week that it is ready to redeploy a longstanding humanitarian mission to the Rafah crossing if and when it is safe to do so.\n“This is a Palestinian town — a Palestinian city. And Palestinians should mainly comprise the majority of the people coming in and out (of Rafah),” al-Arian said, adding that he thinks Israel should have “no veto power” over the entry of aid and goods and the flow of Palestinians through the crossing.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Sam McNeil in Brussels contributed to this report.",

    "body": "After winning Trump’s $20 billion, President Milei must win votes as Argentine industry reels\nPresident Javier Milei stormed to power on a promise to rescue Argentina’s crisis-stricken economy through harsh austerity and free-market reforms. But almost two years later, falling orders and surging competition have forced many companies to cut operations and lay off workers in an attempt to stay afloat. (AP video by Cristian Kovadloff)\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — The factory floor used to roar.\nWalking around his textile mill in southern Buenos Aires, Luciano Galfione pointed out the up-to-the-minute machines that once whirred and clattered as 200 employees churned out fabric to be transformed into athleisure and other apparel for Argentina’s vast middle class.\nBut on Monday afternoon, the factory was so quiet that Galfione’s footsteps rang clear through the compound. A handful of workers at the Galfione Group factory in Argentina’s capital spooled yarn and dyed cloth.\nAlmost two years after libertarian President Javier Milei stormed to power on a promise to rescue Argentina’s crisis-stricken economy through harsh austerity and free-market reforms, falling orders and surging competition have forced Galfione to cut operations by 80%, lay off or suspend half his staff and use his own savings to keep his family’s 78-year-old firm afloat.\nOther companies have simply closed their doors. Over 17,600 businesses — among them 1,800 manufacturers and 380 textile companies — have folded in the last year and a half, according to Fundación Pro Tejer, a nonprofit representing textile manufacturers.\n“We’re seeing an industry in crisis, and it’s about to go bankrupt,” said Galfione, who also runs Fundación Pro Tejer. “Not only textiles. Textiles are just the first and fastest to fall.”\nAs Argentina heads to Oct. 26 midterm elections widely seen as a referendum on Milei’s policies, Galfione’s troubles reflect bigger shocks jolting the country. The economy has sputtered. Cheap imports have gutted manufacturing. Spending has stumbled, squeezed by higher unemployment and lower wages.\nTrump gushes as Argentines groan\nThe turmoil engulfing Argentine financial markets began when voters in the manufacturing belt of suburban Buenos Aires — a region that for decades represented the dream of national industry nurtured by tariff protection — punished Milei in a provincial election last month.\nThe scale of Milei’s humiliation triggered a sharp peso sell-off and sent officials scrambling to secure $20 billion in financing from a friendly Trump administration.\nPresident Donald Trump, who sees a kindred spirit and fellow culture warrior in Argentina’s chain saw wielding leader, shocked Argentines and Americans alike Tuesday by warning that the $20 billion was contingent on Milei’s success in what is shaping up to be a hotly contested legislative election.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent went further on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. could tap investment funds to provide Argentina with up to $40 billion.\n“Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” Trump explained after meeting Milei at the White House.\nThousands of miles away, many Argentines are losing patience with that philosophy.\nThose interviewed on the streets of Buenos Aires Wednesday had no illusions about Trump’s lifeline fixing their problems.\n“Let’s say they give us this money from abroad. What am I going to do with it?” asked Walter Willatt, a 56-year-old newsstand owner whose son was just laid off from a local Toyota dealership. “If the economy revives it will have to be through domestic consumption.”\nMilei’s abrupt reversal of fortunes\nOver a year ago, markets cheered as Milei fulfilled his flagship promise to reduce the runway inflation that he inherited from his populist predecessors. Many Argentines — who had grown accustomed to supermarkets revising prices upward everyday — hailed Milei’s program as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a notoriously topsy-turvy economy.\nBut today, price stability is old news as Argentines contend with a lengthening list of worries.\nUnemployment in Buenos Aires Province climbed to 9.8% in the second quarter of this year, compared to 7.3% during the same period in 2023, before Milei entered office. Salaries nationwide haven’t kept up with inflation. Milei’s major subsidy cuts mean that even if prices have stabilized, Argentines are paying more for bus fares, utility bills and healthcare.\n“Milei’s challenge is that the public now assumes inflation has gone down, that’s a given,” said Marcelo J. García, Director for the Americas for the Horizon Engage political risk consultancy firm. “There’s a new generation of demands. The economy needs to grow, there needs to be job creation. I’m not sure that government is prepared to meet those demands.”\nRodolfo Núñez, a 43-year-old former factory worker in Pilar, outside Buenos Aires, said he voted for Milei in 2023 because he wanted change. Then the blows began to fall. His daughter’s epilepsy medication shot up in price. His retired parents struggled to afford groceries on their $300-a-month pension.\nOn Aug. 29, the ceramic factory where he worked for the last 18 years shut down. The company, ILVA, fired all the plant’s 300 workers in a WhatsApp message that cited the economic crisis, leaving Núñez and his colleagues in limbo, without severance pay or health insurance.\nILVA did not respond to a request for comment.\n“What Milei promised, he didn’t do. He messed with retirees, he messed with my daughter and he messed with the workers,” he said from outside the padlocked ILVA factory where dozens of dismissed employees now camp out in protest, the air filled with smoke from burning tires and roasting chicken.\n“What do I tell my landlord? That I can’t pay her next month? Where am I going to go?”\nNúñez said he voted for the opposition in last month’s regional elections.\nArgentine consumer confidence shot to pieces\nGovernment statistics show poor and middle-class households cutting back on all but essential spending. Clothing sales, for instance, fell 10.9% in September compared to the year before. The collapsed consumption reverberates down the supply chain.\n“We’re reducing costs as much as we can, trying to survive with very low production and without making money,” said Alejandro Schvartz, owner of Visuar, a household appliance vendor and producer whose sales dropped roughly 25% in the first half of this year.\nOther policies that Milei depends on to fight inflation — such as high interest rates and central bank interventions to defend the peso — further erode the competitiveness of Argentine industry.\nThe peso has become so strong that shoppers now get more bang for their buck by splurging anywhere but Argentina — from Chile’s malls to Brazil’s beaches.\nA flood of cutthroat competition\nUpon taking office, Milei tore down trade barriers and relaxed import restrictions, opening Argentina to an avalanche of cheaper industrial and textile products. Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein pay no import duties for products valued below $400.\nBut Milei maintained sky-high taxes for Argentine manufacturers, giving local companies no choice but to pass on the cost to consumers.\n“This is not a fair playing field,” said Pablo Yeramian, director of the Argentine textile company Norfabril, who has already cut 20% of his staff.\nAs scenes of Milei beaming beside Trump in Washington flashed across Argentine televisions on Tuesday, some manufacturers couldn’t help wishing that the similarity between the two presidents was, in at least one way, more than just rhetorical.\n“No developed country in the world surrenders its industrial sovereignty,” said Galfione, pointing to Trump’s “Made in America” ambitions for the U.S. “I think instead of doing what the U.S. tells us, we should do what they do.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Andrea Vulcano in Buenos Aires, Argentina, contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Trump commutes sentence of former US Rep. George Santos in federal fraud case\nTrump commutes sentence of former US Rep. George Santos in federal fraud case\nNEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday he had commuted the sentence of former U.S. Rep. George Santos, who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.\nThe New York Republican was sentenced in April after admitting last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people — including his own family members — to make donations to his campaign.\nHe reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey, on July 25 and is being housed in a minimum security prison camp with fewer than 50 other inmates.\n“George Santos was somewhat of a ‘rogue,’ but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison,” Trump posted on his social media platform. He said he had “just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY.”\n“Good luck George, have a great life!” Trump said.\nJoseph Murray, one of Santos’ lawyers, said late Friday that the former lawmaker’s family was en route to the prison for his release. Andrew Mancilla, another Santos lawyer, applauded the president “for doing the right thing.”\nSpokespersons for the Bureau of Prisons didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\nSantos’ account on X, which has been active throughout his roughly 84 days in prison, reposted a screenshot of Trump’s Truth Social post Friday.\nDuring his time behind bars, Santos has been writing regular dispatches in a local newspaper on Long Island, in which he mainly complained about the prison conditions.\nIn his latest letter, though, he pleaded to Trump directly, citing his fealty to the president’s agenda and to the Republican Party.\n“Sir, I appeal to your sense of justice and humanity — the same qualities that have inspired millions of Americans to believe in you,” he wrote in The South Shore Press on Oct. 13. “I humbly ask that you consider the unusual pain and hardship of this environment and allow me the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.”\nSantos’ commutation is Trump’s latest high-profile act of clemency for former Republican politicians since retaking the White House in January.\nIn late May, he pardoned former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who in 2014 pleaded guilty to underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant he ran in Manhattan. He also pardoned former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints.\nBut in granting clemency to Santos, Trump was rewarding a figure who has drawn scorn from within his own party.\nAfter becoming the first openly gay Republican elected to Congress in 2022, Santos served less than a year after it was revealed that he had fabricated much of his life story.\nOn the campaign trail, Santos had claimed he was a successful business consultant with Wall Street cred and a sizable real estate portfolio. But when his resume came under scrutiny, Santos eventually admitted he had never graduated from Baruch College — or been a standout player on the Manhattan college’s volleyball team, as he had claimed. He had never worked at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\nHe wasn’t even Jewish. Santos insisted he meant he was “Jew-ish” because his mother’s family had a Jewish background, even though he was raised Catholic.\nIn truth, the then-34-year-old was struggling financially and even faced eviction.\nSantos was charged in 2023 with stealing from donors and his campaign, fraudulently collecting unemployment benefits and lying to Congress about his wealth.\nWithin months, he was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives -- with 105 Republicans joining with Democrats to make Santos just the sixth member in the chamber’s history to be ousted by colleagues..\nSantos pleaded guilty as he was set to stand trial.\nStill, a prominent former House colleague, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, urged the White House to commute Santos’ sentence, saying in a letter sent just days into his prison bid that the punishment was “a grave injustice” and a product of judicial overreach.\nGreene was among those who cheered the announcement Friday. But U.S. Rep. Nick LaLota, a Republican who represents part of Long Island and has been highly critical of Santos, said in a post on social media that Santos “didn’t merely lie” and his crimes “warrant more than a three-month sentence.”\n“He should devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged,” LaLota said.\nSantos’ clemency appears to clear not just his prison term, but also any “further fines, restitution, probation, supervised release, or other conditions,” according to a copy of Trump’s order posted on X by Ed Martin, the Justice Department’s pardon attorney.\nAs part of his guilty plea, Santos had agreed to pay restitution of $373,750 and forfeiture of $205,003.\nIn explaining his reason for granting Santos clemency, Trump said the lies Santos told about himself were no worse than misleading statements U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal -- a Democrat and frequent critic of the administration -- had made about his military record.\nBlumenthal apologized 15 years ago for implying that he served in Vietnam, when he was stateside in the Marine Reserve during the war.\n“This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” Trump wrote.\nThe president himself was convicted in a New York court last year in a case involving hush money payments. He derided the case as part of a politically motivated witch hunt.\n__\nAssociated Press writers Michael R. Sisak in New York and Susan Haigh in Connecticut contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Trump administration asks Supreme Court to allow deployment of National Guard in Chicago area\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, escalating President Donald Trump’s conflict with Democratic governors over using the military on U.S. soil.\nThe emergency appeal to the high court came after a judge prevented, for at least two weeks, the deployment of Guard members from Illinois and Texas to assist immigration enforcement. A federal appeals court refused to put the judge’s order on hold.\nThe conservative-dominated court has handed Trump repeated victories in emergency appeals since he took office in January, after lower courts have ruled against him and often over the objection of the three liberal justices. The court has allowed Trump to ban transgender people from the military, claw back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, move aggressively against immigrants and fire the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies,\nIn the dispute over the Guard, U.S. District Judge April Perry said she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump’s immigration crackdown.\nBut Solicitor General D. John Sauer, Trump’s top Supreme Court lawyer, urged the justices to step in immediately. Perry’s order, Sauer wrote, “impinges on the President’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.”\nEleven people were arrested at a Friday protest outside a U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview. Law enforcement had urged demonstrators to stay in designated “protest zones.”\nIn recent weeks, the Broadview ICE facility has been the site of tense protests, where federal agents have previously used tear gas and other chemical agents on protesters and journalists.\nA federal judge in Oregon also has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there.\nMeanwhile, in Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued Friday to try to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, with Trump’s support, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” but only with the blessing of state lawmakers.\nThe deployment “sets a dangerous precedent for military intrusion into local communities,” Memphis City Council member JB Smiley said.\nSince their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling areas of downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power.\n“We’re in a unique spot in this city to have the resources available to us to remove the crime element in Memphis,” Lee said recently.\nFor years, Memphis has dealt with high violent crime, including assaults, carjackings and homicides. While this year’s statistics show improvement, many people acknowledge that violence remains a problem.\nIn California, a judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained and the judge did not order them to leave.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Christine Fernando in Chicago, Adrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee, and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report.",

It wasn’t the first time\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump talks plainly, bluntly, often even coarsely. But it’s rare he drops an actual F-bomb as cameras are rolling.\nBut that’s what he did on Friday, when a journalist asked him about reports that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had offered significant concessions to try to reduce bilateral tensions, including offering the U.S. the natural resources of the country.\n“He has offered everything,” Trump responded, effectively confirming the reports. “He offered everything. You know why? Because he doesn’t want to f--- around with the United States.”\nThe New York Times reported last week that Venezuelan officials offered the U.S. a major stake in the country’s oil and other mineral wealth. But the Trump administration ultimately rejected those offers.\nSeparately, the Associated Press reported that Venezuelan officials had also floated a plan that would have Maduro leave office in three years and hand over power to Delcy Rodriguez, his vice president. That offer was also rejected by the U.S.\nIt didn’t take long for the White House to promote Trump’s curse words, which helped underscore his administration’s hardline stance toward Venezuela and the Maduro regime.\nThe administration’s rapid response account on the social media site X quickly pushed out a video of Trump’s f-bomb, accompanied by three fire emojis. It’s now the pinned post on the “RapidResponse47” account.\nThe official White House account, meanwhile, posted the video with the acronym: “FAFO,” meaning “f--- around and find out.”\nTrump has used the f-word at least one other time on camera this year, when he vented frustration in June about Israel and Iran continuing their fighting despite a ceasefire.\n“I’m not happy with them. I’m not happy with Iran, either, but I’m really unhappy with Israel going out this morning,” Trump said then. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f—— they’re doing.”\nHe’s used the term at other times, too, when the cameras aren’t rolling. In a 2021 interview with an Israeli journalist, Trump lashed out about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s congratulatory comments to former President Joe Biden for winning the 2020 election.\nIn response to a video posted by Netanyahu on Jan. 20, 2021, Trump was quoted as saying: “I haven’t spoken to him since. F—— him.”",

    "body": "Trump offers US automakers additional relief from his tariffs\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is giving domestic automakers additional relief from tariffs on auto parts, extending what was supposed to have been a short-term rebate until 2030.\nIt’s part of a proclamation Trump signed Friday that also made official a 25% import tax on medium and heavy duty trucks, starting Nov. 1.\nThe action reflected the administration’s efforts to use tariffs to promote American manufacturing while also trying to shield the auto sector from the higher costs that Trump’s import taxes have created for parts and raw materials.\nThe special rebate initially announced in April had been set to be lowered and then expire in 2027. At the time, Trump described it as short-term aid “during this little transition” with the expectation that automakers would move production lines back to the U.S.\nThe extension and adjustments came after conversations with the auto industry, senior administration officials said. The goal is to both expand domestic production and make it more competitive. The officials insisted on anonymity as a condition for talking to reporters ahead of Trump signing the proclamation.\nThe amended action provides a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales price of a domestically assembled vehicle. That figure was reached by putting the 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of a vehicle’s sales price. Multiplying those two percentages together is equal to 3.75%.\nThe rebate will also now be offered to manufacturers of trucks and engines, officials said.\nTrump had posted on his social media site Oct. 6 about the new tariffs on imported trucks. Buses will also be tariffed at 10% as part of the action.\nThe new tariffs do not apply to imports covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. That pact, which went into effect in 2020, is up for renegotiation next year.\nThe moves come at a delicate moment for the auto industry as consumers are enduring sticker shock. According to Kelley Blue Book, buyers of new autos spent an average of $50,080 in September, the highest average on record. New auto prices have increased 3.6% from a year ago.",

    "body": "From Spice Girl to fashion mogul, Victoria Beckham grabs the chance to tell her own tale\nFrom Spice Girl to fashion mogul, Victoria Beckham grabs the chance to tell her own tale\nNEW YORK (AP) — Now here’s something you might not quite believe about Victoria Beckham, glam Spice Girl turned high-profile fashion designer: At theater school, they purposely put her in the back row. Because she was too heavy.\n“It was really difficult,” she says now of the memory from her youth, sipping a sparkling water in a Manhattan hotel in between work engagements. “We were all judged on how we looked. I was young. I had bad skin, my weight was going up and down, I had really lank hair.”\nBeckham was also bullied in school and told she was a bad learner, revelations that come in a new documentary, “Victoria Beckham.” The three-part Netflix series traces her career and especially her ascension in the fashion world — building up to a grand Paris runway show at a palace in front of 600 people.\nThat 2024 show — with a rainstorm threatening to scuttle the whole thing — is presented as a career pinnacle for a designer who spent years proving herself alongside giants of the field, showing she wasn’t simply a celebrity slapping her name on a label. ( Vogue’s Anna Wintour is among the fashion luminaries attesting to Beckham’s hard-won industry acceptance in the documentary).\nOf course the show also features liberal doses of Beckham’s soccer legend husband David — just as Victoria appeared in his own recent, popular Netflix documentary “Beckham” (both were produced by David Beckham’s own Studio 99).\nSome reviews have said Victoria’s documentary feels more guarded and less revelatory. In any case, Victoria Beckham says she wanted to tell her own story, her own way. She focuses only briefly on what a certain generation knows her best for — the four years she spent as Posh Spice — and mostly on the two decades she’s been building her eponymous fashion and beauty brand.\nOther revelations: While she was the richer partner when they married in 1999 and in fact bought their first house, it was David Beckham who later invested in her label and helped get it going.\nShe also talks about how her company almost fell apart due to bad business decisions — like spending 70,000 pounds (about $94,000) on office plants and 15,000 (about $20,000) more to water them — and how she learned, with investors, to right the ship.\nBeckham, 51, sat down with The Associated Press this week during a visit to New York. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nAP: The other Beckham documentary appeared only two years ago. Why did you feel the need for your own?\nBECKHAM: Well, his documentary wasn’t about me, you know. I was in the documentary as David’s wife and I’ve been part of his journey and I was so honored to talk about that. People’s response to me in that really surprised me, and there was something quite liberating about that because when I saw myself ... I didn’t like how I came across. But then I think I’ve always felt that way about myself. I suppose it gave me the confidence to do my own.\nAP: What specific stories did you want to tell?\nBECKHAM: I’ve been in the fashion industry for almost two decades. I was in the Spice Girls for four years — and have been so defined by that four-year period in my life. A time that I’m so proud of, but I’ve been fighting preconceptions because of that period. I feel that only now is my brand in a place where me talking about my past will not affect the brand that I’ve built.\nAP: You say this is an inspirational story. How so?\nBECKHAM: I’m not ashamed to say I’m really ambitious. And it’s been the first time that I’ve ever looked back and, having that bird’s eye view on my journey so far, even I found it inspiring what I have done ... the fact that I have been told “No” so many times, told that I’m not enough, not good enough. And by the way, that started when I was a child, when I was at school. If anybody watches this documentary and I can give them the confidence to follow their dreams, that’s another really good reason to do it.\nAP: Do you think people have misperceptions about you?\nBECKHAM: Oh absolutely, I think that for many years I was misunderstood, before social media, you know, the media told the narrative, and then there were paparazzi pictures where most of the time I looked incredibly unhappy. And I think looking at the documentary telling my story from ME explains the “why.” I can’t blame people for looking at the pictures of me looking really grumpy.\nAP: You talk about your weight struggles as a girl in theater class. Have you spoken about that before?\nBECKHAM: Never quite like this. The opportunity has never really presented itself. And I know a lot of people can relate to my story because of all the messages that I’ve had since people have watched the documentary. ... From, yes, people that I know, but people that I don’t know, people who say, “I can relate, I have been through that.” It’s taken this process finally for me to feel at my age proud of what I’ve achieved, and also to finally believe that I am enough.\nAP: It seems like you spend relatively little time in the series on the Spice Girls years.\nBECKHAM: I’m so respectful of my time with the Spice Girls. I still see all of the girls now. I wouldn’t be who I am now ... the Spice Girls gave me the confidence to be me. I remember Geri (Halliwell) saying to me, “You’re funny, be funny.” I’m shy. And they really gave me my personality back. ... I think people would be surprised to know that I was only a Spice Girl for four years. I’ve been in fashion nearly two decades, but people like to pigeonhole.\nAP: Two decades later, do you think there are still people who wonder whether it’s really you doing the designing?\nBECKHAM: Maybe. I don’t know. … I think I’ve earned my place to be showing where I am. I think that I’ve more than proved myself and earned the right to be there. Now I have to work hard to maintain that.\nAP: You talk about business mistakes you made, even when you were getting top reviews for your fashion.\nBECKHAM: I’ve learned so much. I know what I know and I really know what I DON’T know. It got to a stage where my investors told me that we had to re-strategize not just the business side of things but the creative things as well. And that was difficult. ... We had to change a lot of things to fix the business and I took it on the chin. Of course that meant compromising, but I wanted to save the business.\nAP: How is business doing now, both fashion and beauty?\nBECKHAM: Fashion in its own right is profitable. And to be able to say that in this current climate is something I’m very proud of. I’m an independent brand as well, so I’m incredibly proud to say the fashion is making money. Beauty is also doing incredibly well. And now, it is about building the house that I really have always dreamed of.\nAP: You speak about family in the show, going back to your father and his influence on your entrepreneurship. But does it annoy you that people like to write about your current family dynamics?\nBECKHAM: I recognize that I am really blessed. I am very appreciative of the life I have. You have to take it along with the other stuff.",

And, like any happy parent, Keys may visit it every once in a while.\nA new “Hell’s Kitchen” cast has assembled in Cleveland for a national tour that will take them to the South, Midwest and West on a 28-city parade through 2026.\n“It feels so good to know that it’s going to go across the country and this cast, let me tell you, is out of control. They’re so good,” Keys says. “Obviously, everybody can’t get to New York City. Everybody can’t go to Broadway.”\nThose who catch the musical on the road may also get an extra treat. Keys says she’s liable to show up on some stops as a fairy godmother as it crosses the nation.\n“I love, as an artist, bringing my energy to other artists. That’s really a fulfilling feeling. So, I’ll be fairy godmothering. You never know where you’ll see me.”\nA coming-of-age story\n“Hell’s Kitchen” is about 17-year-old New York piano prodigy fueled by Keys songs like “Fallin’,” “No One,” “Girl on Fire,” “If I Ain’t Got You,” as well as several new songs, including “Kaleidoscope.”\nIt centers on a young woman named Ali, who like Keys, is the daughter of a white mother and a Black father and is growing up in a subsidized housing development just outside Times Square in the once-rough neighborhood called Hell’s Kitchen. She learns to hone her music skills, falls in love and reconciles with her sometimes overbearing mom.\nKeys hopes audiences will come for her music, the story and the diverse cast: “It’s really exciting to be able to go somewhere and see yourself on the stage or to see your experience played out.”\nThe Ali on tour is 18-year-old Maya Drake, a recent high school graduate from San Jose, California, who endured a long, rigorous audition process. She was a fan of Keys before the musical popped up on her radar.\n“The fact that I get to be in a show with somebody else’s music and, of all the people, it gets to be her — I got so lucky with that,” says Drake. “Just to have that connection is so special, and it makes the show feel 10 times more enjoyable.”\nAs part of her audition process, Drake came to New York to watch “Hell’s Kitchen” on Broadway, starring Jade Milan as Ali. “It’s a lot seeing it for the first time and she never leaves the stage,” says Drake, who remembers thinking: “To be a part of something that big would just be crazy.”\nAfter the tour cast was announced, the actors were invited onstage at the Shubert Theatre to cheers after a performance, and Drake got to meet and speak to veterans like Jessica Vosk and Kecia Lewis, who won a Tony Award in the show.\n“That was a really special moment,” she says. “Sharing advice and getting insight from the people that are currently doing the show helped us understand what you’re about to get into and some things that can help.”\nThe tour coincides with the publication of “Hell’s Kitchen: Behind the Dream,” a photo-heavy book that charts the show’s 13-year evolution — from crafting the show with book writer Kristoffer Diaz and director Michael Greif to how it would end up with costumes, casting, choreography and staging.\nLife on the road\nAfter Cleveland, the tour goes to Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Denver, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Diego and other cities.\nDrake is, naturally, looking forward to the show going to California, especially the stop in San Francisco, the closest stop for friends and family from San Jose. She’s also excited to be on the road.\n“I really have not traveled a bunch of my life, which is kind of ironic because I’m about to do a lot of traveling,” says Drake, who trained at the Children’s Musical Theater San Jose. “I’m definitely excited to go everywhere.”\nKeys, who watched the show win two Tony Awards and the 2025 Grammy for best musical theater album, thinks the musical about her old New York neighborhood can thrive away from the Big Apple.\n“This is a story inspired by my experiences growing up in New York City, for sure. And, yes, it is a New York story, 1,000%. The thing is, though, the story truly is timeless,” she says. “It’s such an emotional, honest, raw, authentic story that it doesn’t matter if it’s in Cleveland, or if it’s in Detroit, or if it’s in Manhattan or Atlanta.”",

The Mariners became the first home team to win in the series and moved within a victory of the first World Series trip for a franchise that started play in 1977.\nGame 6 is at Toronto on Sunday night.\n“For our fans, they’ve been waiting a long time for this moment and we’re here to give it to them. We’re here to fight for a World Series,” Suárez said.\nRaleigh, a switch-hitting catcher who led the major leagues with 60 home runs during the regular season, was hitting right-handed for the first time in the series when he led off the eighth by pulling a 2-0 changeup from loser Brendon Little.\nThe 348-foot drive rose 155 feet above the field on a high arc and had a 6.7-second hang time before it dropped over the left field wall at T-Mobile Park, 348 feet from the plate.\n“It felt like Cal’s ball was in the air for like an hour,” Mariners manager Dan Wilson said.\nRaleigh’s fourth homer of the postseason tied the score 2-2.\n“Obviously it was really high, so you never know in this building,” Raleigh said. “Luckily today the roof’s closed.”\nJorge Polanco and Josh Naylor walked, and Seranthony Domínguez relieved and hit Randy Arozarena with a pitch.\nSuárez fouled off a 2-2 fastball, then hit an opposite-field drive to right, and the ball landed several rows into the seats for his fourth slam this season.\n“Obviously, this is the biggest home run of my career,” Suárez said.\nSuárez, who had put Seattle ahead in the second against Kevin Gausman, entered the game in a 6-for-50 slump. He was acquired from Arizona at the trade deadline, finished the regular season with 49 homers and has three in the playoffs.\n“I’ve been waiting for this for a long time,” Suárez said. “It’s been a while (since) I’ve had a game like this today. It was awesome being able to hit that grand slam there to give the win to my team, to the fans. They’ve been here supporting us all year long.”\nSeattle’s Bryce Miller was pitching shutout ball when he was removed after allowing Addison Barger’s leadoff single in the fifth, and George Springer hit an RBI double off Matt Brash.\nSpringer left in the seventh when he was hit on the right kneecap by a 95.6 mph sinker from Bryan Woo.\n“He’s got a right knee contusion. He had X-rays, which were negative, which is a good thing.,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. “George is about as tough as they come. I think he’ll have to really, really be hurting to not be in the lineup on Sunday.”\nPitching for the first time since Sept. 19 after recovering from pectoral tightness, Woo allowed Ernie Clement’s go-ahead single in the sixth.\nGabe Speier got the win with a perfect, nine-pitch eighth inning. Toronto wasted many chances, going 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position.\nRaleigh turned only the second 2-3 grounded double into play in postseason history when Clement tapped the ball onto the plate with the bases loaded and one out in the fourth inning. Raleigh grabbed the ball with a foot on the plate for a forceout, then threw to first.\nThe prior 2-3 DP in Game 2 of the 2000 ALCS was turned by Wilson with the New York Yankees’ Bernie Williams at the plate.\n“That’s what he’s done all season long, both sides of the ball,” Wilson said of Raleigh.\nUp next\nRookie RHP Trey Yesavage, who started Game 2 of both the AL Division Series, will start for the Blue Jays in Game 6. The Mariners scored five runs off the 22-year-old on Monday.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

The fearsome slugger who was third in the majors with 55 homers during the regular season hadn’t connected since Sept. 30.\nAlthough Ohtani tripled and scored in the first inning of Game 3 against Milwaukee, that was his only extra-base hit in the last eight games — and just one of his six postseason RBIs came in the past five games.\nOhtani went 2 for 11 with three walks in his first three games against the Brewers.\nWhile his two-way role requires him to do extensive off-field work to stay ready for both jobs, Ohtani probably wouldn’t blame his plate struggles on his pitching responsibilities. In fact, he had pitched in only two games over the past 30 days before Game 4, thanks to the permutations of the Dodgers’ schedule.\nIn his last regular-season start, Ohtani pitched six scoreless innings of five-hit ball against Arizona on Sept. 23, throwing a season-high 91 pitches. In his MLB postseason mound debut Oct. 4, he gave up three runs over six innings with nine strikeouts to earn the victory in Los Angeles’ 5-3 win at Philadelphia in the Division Series opener.\nOhtani also had the motivation of matching his fellow Dodgers starters, who have been phenomenal on the mound ever since the playoff race got serious.\nThe Dodgers’ rotation held batters in September to an MLB record-low .173 average for a single month. Since the postseason began, Los Angeles’ four starting pitchers — Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani — had allowed just 10 earned runs while pitching 58 1/3 innings with 71 strikeouts over those nine games.\nWhat’s more, only three Brewers had ever faced Ohtani on the mound heading into Game 4.\n“It’s always a little advantage (to the) pitcher when they haven’t seen you before,” Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said. “But they’re 170 games in. They understand that you’re not facing Shohei, you’re facing the ball.”\nRoberts said Roki Sasaki was available out of the bullpen in Game 4 for what would be his first back-to-back appearances since the rookie rejoined the Dodgers’ roster as a reliever.\nSasaki has been mostly outstanding since he became the Dodgers’ de facto closer, picking up three saves while allowing just two hits and one run in seven innings of relief across six playoff games.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",

He also had three steals, and the 76ers outscored the Wolves by 12 points when Embiid was on the floor.\nPhiladelphia coach Nick Nurse said before the game that Embiid would have “fairly short” stints of action and held true to that plan. Embiid didn’t play in the fourth quarter.\nThe 76ers open the regular season at Boston on Wednesday night.\nEmbiid didn’t take long to get going Friday — he tried a 3-pointer, which missed, on Philadelphia’s first possession just seven seconds into the contest. He played about six minutes in his first stint to open the game, then played the first three minutes of the second quarter for his second stint.\nIt was Embiid’s first game since Feb. 22. He missed the first nine games of Philadelphia’s 2024-25 season, never played more than four consecutive games and wound up being shut down for the final 26 games of the year as the 76ers sputtered to a 24-58 finish.\nEmbiid has been engaged in light practices since the 76ers opened camp and the perennially injured All-Star center has said in recent weeks that there was a “plan in place” to play following knee surgery in April.\nA two-time NBA scoring champion, Embiid had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in April following an injury-plagued season that also included a sprained left foot and a sinus fracture. He was ruled out for the season in late February after averaging 23.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists.\n“I’ve had so many injuries,” Embiid said last month. “The only thing I’ve always told myself is you can’t give up.”\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "body": "US blocks a global fee on shipping emissions as international meeting ends without new regulations\nUS blocks a global fee on shipping emissions as international meeting ends without new regulations\nWith trade threats from President Donald Trump, the U.S. derailed the world’s first global carbon fee on shipping as an international maritime meeting adjourned Friday without adopting regulations.\nEarlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world’s largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process — adopting the regulations — during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.\nInstead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.\nThe development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a “con job,” extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.\n“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.\nThe Trump administration was quick to celebrate\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as “another huge win” for Trump.\n“Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,” Rubio wrote on X. “Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”\nTrump had urged countries to vote “No,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.\nAfter vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.\nArsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that “geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.”\nNations falter in their efforts to save the planet\nThe decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.\nThe world’s biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.\n“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” Regenvanu said. “But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.”\nShipping emissions grow\nLarge ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.\nThomas Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.\nShipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.\nThe regulations, or “Net-Zero Framework,” would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.\n“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.\nThe IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.\n“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "Regional banks’ bad loans spark concerns on Wall Street\nNEW YORK (AP) —\nWall Street is concerned about the health of the nation’s regional banks, after a few of them wrote off bad loans to commercial customers in the last two weeks and caused investors to wonder if there might be more bad news to come.\nZions Bank, Western Alliance Bank and the investment bank Jefferies surprised investors by disclosing various bad investments on their books, sending their stocks falling sharply this week. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon added to the unease when he warned there might be more problems to come for banks with potentially bad loans.\n“When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Dimon told investors and reporters on Tuesday, when JPMorgan reported its results.\nThe KBW Bank Index, a basket of banks tracked by investors, is down 7% this month.\nThere were other signs of distress. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that banks tapped the central bank’s overnight “repo” facilities for the second night in a row, an action banks have not needed to take since the Covid-19 pandemic. This facility allows banks to convert highly liquid securities like mortgage bonds and treasuries into cash to help fund their short-term cash shortfalls.\nZions Bancorp shares sank Thursday after the bank wrote off $50 million in commercial and industrial loans, while Western Alliance fell after the bank alleged it had been defrauded by an entity known as Cantor Group V LLC. This came on top of news from Jefferies, which told investors it was might experience millions of dollars in losses from its business with bankrupt auto parts company First Brands.\nAll three stocks recovered a bit Friday. Jefferies’ CEO told investors that the company believes it was defrauded by First Brands and there were no broader concerns in the lending market.\nThe last banking flare up, in 2023, also involved mid-sized and regional banks that were overly exposed to low-interest loans and commercial real estate. The crisis caused Silicon Valley Bank to fail, followed by Signature Bank, and led to the eventual sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale. Other banks like Zions and Western Alliance ended up seeing their stocks plummet during that time period.\nWhile banks do fail or get bought at fire sale prices, all bank deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, up to $250,000 per account, in case of a bank failure. In the nearly 100 years since the FDIC was created in 1933, not one depositor has lost their insured funds.\nStill, even the larger banks aren’t immune in this latest round of trouble. Several Wall Street banks disclosed losses this week in the bankruptcy of Tricolor, a subprime auto dealership company that collapsed last month. Fifth Third Bank, a larger regional bank, recorded a $178 million loss from Tricolor’s bankruptcy.\nThat said, the big banks believe that any losses will be manageable and do not reflect the broader economy.\n“There is no deterioration, we’re very confident with our credit portfolio,” Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing said, in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Friday.\nWhile the big Wall Street banks get most of the media and investor attention, regional banks are a major part of the economy, lending to small-to-medium sized businesses and acting as major lenders for commercial real estate developers. There are more than 120 banks with between $10 billion and $200 billion in assets, according to the FDIC.\nWhile big, these banks can run into trouble because their businesses are not as diverse as the Wall Street money center banks. They’re often more exposed to real estate and industrial loans, and don’t have significant businesses in credit cards and payment processing that can be revenue generators when lending goes south.",

    "body": "FAA allows Boeing to increase 737 Max production nearly two years after door plug flew off plane\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said Friday it will allow Boeing to produce more 737 Max airplanes by increasing the monthly limit that it imposed after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines jet that the company built.\nBoeing can now produce 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, after safety inspectors conducted extensive reviews of the aerospace company’s manufacturing lines to ensure an increase in production can be done safely, the FAA said.\nThe agency had set a cap on production shortly after the terrifying January 2024 incident involving the Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet. In practice, though, the production rate fell well below the ceiling last year as the company contended with investigations and a machinists’ strike that idled factories for almost eight weeks. But Boeing said over the summer that it had reached the monthly cap in the second quarter and would eventually seek the FAA’s permission to start producing more of the planes.\nA spokesperson for Boeing said Friday that the company followed a “disciplined process” to make sure it was ready to safely increase production, using safety guidelines and performance goals that it set with the FAA.\n“We appreciate the work by our team, our suppliers and the FAA to ensure we are prepared to increase production with safety and quality at the forefront,” Boeing said in a statement.\nThe FAA also said Friday this won’t change the way it oversees Boeing production processes and its efforts to strengthen the company’s safety culture, adding that FAA inspectors at Boeing plants have continued to work through the federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1.\nJust last month, the FAA also restored Boeing’s ability to perform final safety inspections on 737 Max jetliners and certify them for flight. Boeing hadn’t been allowed to do that for more than six years, after two crashes of the then-new model killed 346 people. The FAA took full control over 737 Max approvals in 2019, after the second of the two crashes that were later blamed on a new software system Boeing developed for the aircraft.\nEarlier this year, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg faced questions from a Senate committee about the production rate of the 737 Max, with lawmakers seeking reassurance from Ortberg that the company was prioritizing quality and safety over meeting production targets for profit.\n“Just to be very clear, we won’t ramp up production if the performance isn’t indicating a stable production system,” Ortberg said at the April hearing. “We will continue to work on getting to a stable system.”\nThe incident involving the Alaska Airlines flight that prompted the production cap on Max jets was among a series of alleged safety violations by Boeing between September 2023 and February 2024 that led to the FAA seeking $3.1 million in fines from the company.",

The other cosmic snowball, Comet SWAN, should have its flyby with Earth on Monday, but it’s headed away from the sun and will likely grow dimmer as the days pass.\nSpotting two comets simultaneously without special equipment is “rare, but not unprecedented,” said Carson Fuls, director of the University of Arizona-based sky survey that spotted Comet Lemmon.\nTo see the pair, go outside just after sunset and look to the northern sky for Comet Lemmon close to the horizon. Comet SWAN will also be near the horizon, but to the southwest.\nThe double comets could be visible with binoculars through the end of the month, but experts aren’t yet sure how bright they’ll remain, said astronomer Valerie Rapson of the State University of New York at Oneonta.\nComets are frozen leftovers from the solar system’s formation billions of years ago. They heat up as they swing toward the sun, releasing their characteristic streaming tails.\nComet Lemmon, also designated C/2025 A6, was discovered in January by a telescope scouring the night sky for near-Earth asteroids. Comet SWAN, also known as C/2025 R2, was spotted in September by an amateur astronomer using photos from a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency.\nThe comets are green because of gases streaming off their surfaces. From Earth, they’ll look like gray, fuzzy patches.\nEarlier this year, a green comet broke up as it swung by the sun, dashing hopes of a naked-eye spectacle. A bright comet called Tsuchinshan-Atlas zoomed by Earth in 2024, and other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020 and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Faulty engineering led to implosion of Titan submersible headed to Titanic wreckage, NTSB finds\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Faulty engineering led to the implosion of an experimental submersible that killed five people on the way to the wreck of the Titanic, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded in a report Wednesday.\nThe NTSB made the statement in its final report on the hull failure and implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023. Everyone on board the submersible died instantly in the North Atlantic when Titan suffered a catastrophic implosion as it descended to the wreck.\nThe NTSB report states that the faulty engineering of the Titan “resulted in the construction of a carbon fiber composite pressure vessel that contained multiple anomalies and failed to meet necessary strength and durability requirements.” It also stated that OceanGate, the owner of the Titan, failed to adequately test the Titan and was unaware of its true durability.\nThe report also said the wreckage of the Titan likely would have been found sooner had OceanGate followed standard guidance for emergency response, and that would have saved “time and resources even though a rescue was not possible in this case.”\nThe NTSB report dovetails with a Coast Guard report released in August that described the Titan implosion as preventable. The Coast Guard determined that safety procedures at OceanGate, a private company based in Washington state, were “critically flawed” and found “glaring disparities” between safety protocols and actual practices.\nOceanGate suspended operations in July 2023 and wound down. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Wednesday.\nIn August, after the Coast Guard report was released, a company spokesperson offered condolences to the families of those who died.\nThe Titan’s implosion killed OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush and led to lawsuits and calls for tighter regulation of private deep sea expeditions. The implosion also killed French underwater explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, known as “Mr. Titanic”; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood.\nThe NTSB report recommends the Coast Guard commission a panel of experts to study submersibles and other pressure vehicles for human occupancy. It also recommends that the Coast Guard implement regulations for the vehicles that are informed by that study. The report states that current regulations for small passenger vessels “enabled OceanGate’s operation of the Titan in an unsafe manner.”\nThe report also called on the Coast Guard to “disseminate findings of the study to the industry,” which has grown in recent years as privately financed exploration has grown.\nThe company was aware of the possibility of Coast Guard regulations prior to the implosion. In describing OceanGate’s corporate culture, the report quotes an operations technician who quit the company after expressing concern about calling paying passengers “mission specialists.” The company’s CEO responded that “if the Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away,” the technician said, according to the report.\nThe vessel had been making voyages to the Titanic site since 2021. Its final dive came on the morning of June 18, 2023. The submersible lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later and was reported overdue that afternoon. Ships, planes and equipment were rushed to the scene about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of St. John’s, Newfoundland.\nA multiday search for survivors off Canada made international headlines. It soon became clear there would be no survivors, and the Coast Guard and other authorities began lengthy investigations into what had happened.\n___\nRamer reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "body": "UN agency says CO2 levels hit record high last year, causing more extreme weather\nGENEVA (AP) — Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a level not seen in human civilization and “turbo-charging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, the United Nations weather agency said Wednesday.\nThe World Meteorological Organization said in its latest bulletin on greenhouse gases, an annual study released ahead of the U.N.’s annual climate conference, that CO2 growth rates have now tripled since the 1960s, and reached levels that existed more than 800,000 years ago.\nEmissions from burning coal, oil and gas, alongside more wildfires, have helped fan a “vicious climate cycle,” and people and industries continue to spew heat-trapping gases while the planet’s oceans and forests lose their ability to absorb them, the WMO report said.\nThe Geneva-based agency said the increase in the global average concentration of carbon dioxide from 2023 to 2024 amounted to the highest annual level of any one-year span since measurements began in 1957. Growth rates of CO2 have accelerated from an annual average increase of 2.4 parts per million per year in the decade from 2011 to 2020, to 3.5 ppm from 2023 to 2024, it said.\n“The heat trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett in a statement. “Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being.”\nWhat’s disturbing is not just the increase in greenhouse gases, but that it may be signaling a problem in the long-standing and delicate carbon cycle, where humans, industry, cars and animals spew carbon dioxide into the air and forests and oceans pull much of it out of the air, reducing some of the potential warming effect, said WMO senior scientific officer Oksana Tarasova.\nNatural land sinks, including the Amazon, remove about one-quarter of the carbon dioxide in the air and the world’s oceans suck up another quarter, she said.\n‘We may flip over the tipping point’\nThe increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere “is very important in the sense that probably we started seeing the early indication of the limited capacity of the natural systems to actually absorb everything we emit,” Tarasova told a news conference. She pointed to the Amazon, which had severe drought and heat, limiting trees’ ability to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\n“The sinks which we have, they started failing,” Tarasova said. “The Amazon indeed is emitting CO2, despite the general understanding that if you have a tree, it should absorb.”\n“What also may happen is that at a certain point we may flip over the tipping point and then the whole Amazon forest just starts dying.”\nBill Hare, the founder of research organization Climate Analytics, called the new data “alarming and worrying.”\nEven though fossil fuel emissions were “relatively flat” last year, he said, the report appeared to show an accelerating increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, “signaling a positive feedback from burning forests and warming oceans driven by record global temperatures.”\n“Let there be no mistake, this is a very clear warning sign that the world is heading into an extremely dangerous state — and this is driven by the continued expansion of fossil fuel development, globally,” Hare said. “I’m beginning to feel that this points to a slow-moving climate catastrophe unfolding in front of us.”\nWMO called on policymakers to take more steps to help reduce emissions.\nWhile several governments have been pushing for further use of hydrocarbons like coal, oil and gas for energy production, some businesses and local governments have been mobilizing to fight global warming.\nStill, Hare said very few countries have made new climate commitments to come “anywhere near dealing with the gravity of the climate crisis.”\nLevels still rising\nThe increase in 2024 is setting the planet on track for more long-term temperature increase, WMO said. It noted that concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide — other greenhouse gases caused by human activity — have also hit record levels.\nThe report was bound to raise new doubts on the world’s ability to hit the goal laid out in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.\nUnited Nations climate chief, Simon Stiell, has said the Earth is now on track for 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 Fahrenheit).\nMeanwhile, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s global data for this year through June reveals that carbon dioxide levels are still rising at one of the highest rates on record, yet not quite as high as from 2023 to 2024.\nThe agency’s monthly data for the long-running Hawaii monitoring location for 2025 through August also showed CO2 rates are still increasing, but not as much as between 2023-2024.\n__\nBorenstein reported from Washington.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "Poetry helped R&B singer Jessie Reyez find her voice. Her latest book shares it with the world\nPoetry helped R&B singer Jessie Reyez find her voice. Her latest book shares it with the world\nLong before Jessie Reyez was celebrated for her voice, poetry was the Toronto-bred musician’s “first love.”\nThe Grammy-nominated and Juno Award winner’s music often feels like spoken poetry, backed by a mix of R&B, hip-hop and Latin beats. When music, and the commercial demands of the industry, fail to satiate her creative hunger, Reyez turns to writing and often asks her millions of Instagram followers for poetry prompts.\nShe compiled some of those poems, previously only available on a 24-hour Instagram story timeline, into a book, “The People’s Purge: Words of a Goat Princess Volume II,” releasing Tuesday.\nThe exercise, which Reyez now does weekly, allows her to create and release almost instantly and felt like scratching “an itch in the middle of my brain that I can’t reach,” she told The Associated Press.\n“When you’re fortunate enough to find a job in creativity and you’re getting paid for your art, it can create this bastardized version of what you’re making. Some of the purity is jeopardized,” Reyez said. “You really have to be your art’s security guard.”\nReyez has written about “Breadcrumbs” and “Air.” Other prompts are specific, like one titled, “Stubbing your toe on the table when you were having a good day.” The prompts are boundless, Reyez said. “It’s like having a snapshot of the world’s emotional state.”\nThis year has been a busy one for Reyez, emblematic of the her non-stop creative flow. She has been on tour since early June for her latest album, “Paid in Memories.” She began a U.S. book tour this month and will return to the international leg of her musical tour in November.\nShe recently spoke about her upcoming book, the freedom that poetry offers and how she protects her creative flow.\nRemarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.\nAP: How does writing poetry differ from writing songs?\nREYEZ: Writing has always been my first love. Poetry has been my love before music. I like the idea of release. I love the idea of freedom. Freedom feels like home for me. Even though I love creating as a musician, when you are creating a song, you have the boundaries of the music around it for the lyrics and for the melody. There’s just more rules that you have to abide by. But I feel the most free when I write and I’m not beholden to the fences of the chords of the song that I’m in, or to the melody of the song that I’m in.\nAP: Why did you decide to compile the poems into a book?\nREYEZ: I love the ephemeral nature of them when I’m making it. But, because it is such a community thing, there were people that started to be like, “I wish I was here for it. I wish we can keep it.” It became more apparent to me that this is a team thing. I wanted to make sure that people could, you know, hold what they’ve made in tandem with me.\nAP: How did you choose which poems were included?\nREYEZ: I’ve become very skilled at objectively critiquing myself. For music, it’s a little bit more difficult because the thing is, music can act like makeup sometimes. If you take a great song and you read it, it should be strong enough to be able to sound like a beautiful poem without having any music. That’s kind of what I love when I play with words. It just becomes that much more apparent what is well done versus what is going to hit the cutting room floor.\nAP: One of the poems is completely in Spanish and your Colombian heritage shines throughout the book. Did that come naturally?\nREYEZ: It’s not so much something that I have to be cognizant of because it’s naturally in me. It is in my blood, it’s in my heart, it is in my soul, it’s in the way I love. However, as much as Spanish is my first language — it’s the language I learned to be human in, it was the language that I learned love in — it’s not the language which I studied. The library of words that I can pull from is just a lot larger in English, so by default my output is more in English.\nAP: Some of the prompts are super specific and others are vague. How did that impact your writing process?\nREYEZ: There is not one that I like more than the other. I literally just love the entire process because it’s challenging in both ways. When it’s specific, it’s a challenge because you have to dig a little bit deeper to find it. I think everybody has that ability. You just need to learn how to like open the box, dig in, and then you’re able to find so many things in common and so many thing that you and I went through. It’s like a different shade of blue, but it’s still blue.\nAP: I really enjoyed how you flipped some of the prompts on their head. For instance, one prompt asked for a poem about “Big butts,” and you wrote about buts, as in hesitations in a relationship. Was that intentional?\nREYEZ: I do it a lot. That’s the method of finding how it relates to you, you know what I mean? “Big Butts” is a good one. I love that you recalled that one as an example. I love the idea of play. I love the idea of challenge. Every now and then, I get one where it feels like the person is almost like, “In what world is she gonna make something with a prompt like that,” you know?\nAP: You do this exercise about once a week. I’m sure you’ve written many more poems. Are there more iterations of this book that might come in the future?\nREYEZ: Yeah, maybe. It’s really funny, because the day we turned it in, I did the exercise again. The week after the deadline, I did the exercise again. I really had to show some restraint. Shout out to deadlines. Deadlines are the gift of the creative because otherwise this would have been a never-ending book. We’ll see. If it’s meant to be, sure.",

A visit to The Grove and LSU’s Cajun feasts\nGet the AP Top 25 college football poll delivered straight to your inbox every week with AP Top 25 Poll Alerts. Sign up here.\nIn the South, there is only one thing that can rival college football itself: the party before kickoff.\nPinpointing the exact origins of tailgating is near impossible. Some trace it to Nov. 6, 1869, when Rutgers and New Jersey (later Princeton) played in the first college football game. Others credit Green Bay Packers fans, who folded down pickup truck tailgates for makeshift pregame seating during the team’s inaugural season in 1919.\nArguments over who has the best tailgating traditions are as old as the sport itself and the creativity is as varied as the fans themselves. From Bevo Boulevard (Texas) and the Tiger Walk (Clemson) to the Vol Navy (Tennessee) and the sailgating outside Husky Stadium (Washington) the options are endless.\nThe tradition runs deep in the South, and few do it like Ole Miss and LSU.\nIt’s hours before kickoff. Ole Miss is hosting LSU in its biggest game of the season so far, and tens of thousands of fans gather at The Grove, a 10-acre plot in the center of campus surrounded by oak trees. The grassy area has transformed into a sea of red and blue tents decked out with chandeliers and elaborate spreads.\nAnticipation builds for The Walk of Champions – one of the program’s longest-standing traditions where coaches and players are met with applause and “Hotty Toddy” cheers as they exit the buses and pass under the historic archway en route to the stadium.\nElizabeth Heiskell, a caterer from Oxford, Mississippi, is at the center of it all. She’s become a Grove regular since marrying into the fan base, and she wouldn’t want it any other way.\nThink you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it’s your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll.\n“It is a beautiful space right in the middle of campus with gorgeous trees that have been here forever,” Heiskell said. “There’s just really no place like it. It’s not like we’re, you know, dropping a tailgate in some parking lot. I mean, it is so green and so beautiful.”\nLike most Grove goers, Heiskell is dressed for the occasion. She’s wearing a red and white blouse, gold jewelry and a fabulous pair of red sunglasses that tie the whole look together. This isn’t an outfit she just threw together; gameday getups are carefully curated.\n“Of course everybody gets dressed up. I mean, we shop all year long for our game clothes,” she said. “When they say it’s a red game, honey, we’re all gonna wear red.”\nThe pregame buzz carries into Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, where nearly 68,000 fans watch Ole Miss hold off LSU for a 24-19 victory.\nTwo weeks later, crawfish boils and Cajun spices replace the chandeliers and elegance of The Grove as the party moves 330 miles South to Baton Rouge.\nFresh off a bye week, LSU lis hosting South Carolina in Death Valley, where home-field advantage is alive and well, thanks to a passionate fan base of their own.\nGameday preparation begins on Thursday nights for Wayne Breaux, a fisherman from New Iberia, Louisiana. He drives up to his condo near campus on Thursday night, reserves his spot on Friday and begins the setup early Saturday. After 35 years, his tailgate has become quite the attraction. Breaux regularly welcomes football, basketball and softball coaches and recruits.\n“Tailgating is an event in itself. A lot of people, even if they don’t have tickets to the game, they’ll come out and enjoy the atmosphere, the friendship and the camaraderie,” Breaux said. “I love the football game itself, but tailgating is a very close second.”\nLike every good tailgate, Breaux’s setup centers around the menu. His spread features speckled trout, red fish, steak tips, pork loin, and of course, jambalaya and boudin.\n“We got one rule,” Breaux said. “If you leave here thirsty or hungry, it’s your fault. It’s not mine.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here and here (AP News mobile app).

His death triggered public outrage in South Korea, prompting the government to send a delegation to the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, for talks on joint responses.\nCambodian Interior Ministry spokesperson Touch Sokhak said earlier that 64 South Koreans were to be repatriated from Cambodia late Friday. After their chartered plane landed at South Korea’s Incheon International Airport on Saturday morning, the returnees were seen in handcuffs, each escorted by police officers on both sides, as they were led to a parking area where security vehicles were waiting to transport them.\nMost of the repatriated South Koreans were detained in Cambodia during crackdowns on scam centers and will face police investigations at home, Seoul’s national security director Wi Sung-lac said. Authorities are likely seeking to determine whether they had willingly joined the organizations or were forced to work after being lured by false job ads.\nScam centers in Cambodia are estimated to have about 200,000 workers, including 1,000 South Koreans, according to South Korean officials.\nOnline scams have risen sharply since the COVID-19 pandemic and produced two sets of victims — those forced to work as scammers under the threat of violence, and the targets of their fraud via bogus investment pitches, illegal gambling schemes and even romantic ploys. Monitoring groups say online scams earn international criminal gangs billions of dollars annually.\nA South Korean travel ban came into effect Thursday for parts of Cambodia, including Bokor Mountain in Kampot province, where the South Korean student was found dead. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has requested the restrictions are eased, Seoul’s Foreign Ministry said.\nSouth Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Friday ordered authorities to take urgent action to try to remove illegal advertisements for jobs not only in Cambodia but also across Southeast Asia.\nOnline scam centers were previously concentrated in Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Myanmar, with most of the trafficked and other workers coming from Asia. But an Interpol report in June said the past three years have seen victims trafficked to Southeast Asia from distant regions including South America, Western Europe and Eastern Africa and that new centers have been reported in the Middle East, West Africa and Central America.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report from Seoul.

And Meta said Friday that parents will be able to get “insights” about what their kids are chatting about with AI characters — although they won’t get access to the full chats.\nThe changes come as the social media giant faces ongoing criticism over harms to children from its platforms. AI chatbots are also drawing scrutiny over their interactions with children that lawsuits claim have driven some to suicide.\nEven so, more than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.\nOn Tuesday, Meta announced that teen accounts on Instagram will be restricted to seeing PG-13 content by default and won’t be able to change their settings without a parent’s permission. This means kids using teen-specific accounts will see photos and videos on Instagram that are similar to what they would see in a PG-13 movie — no sex, drugs or dangerous stunts.\nMeta said the PG-13 restrictions will also apply to AI chats.\nChildren’s online advocacy groups, however, are skeptical about Meta’s intentions.\n“Meta’s new parental controls on Instagram are an insufficient, reactive concession that wouldn’t be necessary if Meta had been proactive about protecting kids in the first place,” said James Steyer, Common Sense Media founder and CEO. “On top of this, Meta is taking its sweet time, waiting months to implement this new feature at a pivotal moment where every second counts.”\n“For too long, this company has put the relentless pursuit of engagement over our kids’ safety, ignoring warnings from parents, experts, and even its own employees.”\nMeta AI chatbots, Steyer added, “are not safe for anyone under 18.”\nCommon Sense Media does not recommend minors use AI chatbots of any kind.",

We want parents to have peace of mind and we want young people — young Australians — to have three more years to learn who they are before platforms assume who they are,” Communications Minister Anika Wells told reporters, referring to the current de facto 13-year age limit for social media accounts based on U.S. privacy legislation.\nThe Australian age restrictions have already proved polarizing, with some experts warning the changes will harm as well as protect children. More than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to the government last year opposing a social media age limit as “too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.”\nDespite that warning, the laws passed with resounding support last year. The platforms had a year to figure out how to comply without foolproof technology available to verify ages.\nInman Grant said the social media age restriction would be a “very monumental event for a lot of young people.”\nHer agency offered checklists and conversation starters about ways to make the transition, such as following an online influencer through a website rather than a social media account, she said.\n“How do we start weaning them from social media now so it isn’t a shock on Dec. 10? How do we help them download their archives and their memories and how do we make sure that they’re in touch with friends and are aware of mental health support if they’re feeling down when they’re not tethered to their phones over the holiday period?” she added.\nAustralia’s move is being watched closely by countries that share concerns about social media impacts on young children.\nDenmark’s Ambassador to Australia Ingrid Dahl-Madsen said her government would use its current presidency of the Council of the European Union to push the agenda of protecting children from social media harms.\n“This is something that is a global challenge and we are all looking at how we can manage it best and we are looking to Australia and we will be looking at what Australia does,” Dahl-Madsen told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne on Monday.\n“It’s so important that Australia and Demark and the EU — we share lessons, we compare experiences and we can push forward hopefully practical progress on this,” she added. It was about “protecting our children in this digital world that is increasingly complicated.”\nThe Danish government last week proposed legislating an age limit of 15. But Dahl-Madsen said Denmark would consider letting parents exempt their children who were 13-14. Australia has no similar exemption.",

    "body": "Trump announces a deal with a manufacturer to make a common fertility drug cheaper for IVF patients\nTrump announces a deal with a manufacturer to make a common fertility drug cheaper for IVF patients\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Drugmaker EMD Serono will reduce the cost of a common fertility medication through a deal struck with the Trump administration, President Donald Trump said Thursday while also unveiling new federal guidance he said will encourage employers to offer fertility coverage.\nThe new guidance will allow companies to offer fertility benefits separate from major medical insurance plans, like they do with dental and vision plans, Trump said.\n“We want to make it easier for all couples to have babies, raise children and start the families they have always dreamed about,” Trump said.\nThe Oval Office announcement offers a first glimpse at how Trump plans to follow up on his executive order earlier this year aiming to reduce the cost of in vitro fertilization, a medical procedure that helps people facing infertility build their families. But it falls far short of his promise as a candidate to make IVF treatment free. It marks the third deal the administration has made with pharmaceutical companies to cut drug prices in recent weeks.\nEMD Serono’s Gonal-f is among several drugs frequently used by patients going through IVF treatments — which involve using hormones to trigger ovulation, producing multiple eggs that are retrieved from the ovaries to be fertilized or frozen. The drugs can be expensive, often costing patients thousands of dollars for a single IVF cycle. Many patients trying to get pregnant through IVF go through more than one cycle.\nThe White House and EMD Serono said the drug, along with all its other IVF medications, will be available at a discount on TrumpRx, a government website where patients will be able to buy drugs directly from manufacturers. The Trump administration contends that the new website, which is expected to be running in 2026, will cut pharmaceutical costs by allowing people to buy them without a middleman.\nTrump said the Food and Drug Administration will also be working with EMD Serono to expedite approval of another one of its fertility drugs available in Europe, called Pergoveris.\nDr. Mehmet Oz, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that as a result of the changes: “There are going to be a lot of Trump babies. I think that’s probably a good thing.”\nThursday’s announcement comes after Trump issued a February executive order pledging to make IVF more affordable. During his campaign last year, Trump pledged that if he was elected, he would make IVF treatment free.\n“Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” he said at an event in Michigan. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.”\nThat pledge came in the wake of growing pressure after his Supreme Court nominees helped overturn the right to abortion in Roe v. Wade that kicked off an effort in GOP-led states to impose new restrictions, including some that have threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at conception.\nAsked on Thursday about conservatives who have religious objections to IVF and are critical of his support for it, Trump said he wasn’t aware of those views.\n“I don’t know about the views of that,” Trump said. “I’m just looking to do something because, you know, pro-life, I think this is very pro-life.”\n“You can’t get more pro-life than this,” he added.\nRoger Shedlin, CEO of the fertility and family building benefits company WIN, on Wednesday expressed excitement about what he called “steps in the right direction.”\n“Any initiative that addresses the cost of drugs will have a material positive impact on the overall cost of the fertility cycle,” he said.\nCorinn O’Brien, 39, of Birmingham, Alabama, said anything to lower the costs of IVF would be “huge for families.”\nO’Brien said she underwent three rounds of IVF and gave birth to a daughter in June. Each time, the drugs would cost anywhere from around $1,000 to $5,000.\nShe said covering the whole IVF cycle “ultimately would be a game changer for families,” but helping with the cost of drugs “is progress and is much appreciated.”\nO’Brien added it would be great if more employers would cover fertility services because, for many, “this is their only chance to expand their family.”\n___\nSwenson reported from New York.

    "body": "FDA unveils drugs to receive expedited review in support of ‘national priorities’\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced the first round of experimental drugs that will receive drastically expedited reviews at the agency, part of an effort to prioritize medicines the Trump administration deems as “supporting U.S. national interests.”\nThe nine medicines announced by the FDA include potential treatments for vaping addiction, deafness, pancreatic cancer and other conditions.\nSeveral of the drugs would compete with higher-priced drugs already on the U.S. market.\nAt the White House, President Donald Trump highlighted the injectable infertility drug, Pergoveris, which is currently sold in Europe for patients going through IVF treatments. Trump said FDA approval of the drug in the U.S. would help lower IVF costs for American families, one of his campaign pledges.\nAnother drugmaker received the specialty review to expand U.S. manufacturing of ketamine, the powerful anesthetic that has grown into a trendy psychedelic treatment.\nUnder the program announced earlier this year, the FDA will aim to decide whether to approve the drugs in one to two months, an unprecedented pace for the in-depth safety and effectiveness reviews performed by agency scientists.\nFDA’s accelerated approval program generally issues decisions in six months for drugs that treat life-threatening diseases. Regular drug reviews take about 10 months.\nSince arriving at the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has suggested the agency could dramatically speed up approvals for certain high-priority drugs, pointing to the truncated process used to authorize the first COVID-19 vaccines under Operation Warp Speed.\nMany aspects of the so-called Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher program overlap with older FDA programs. But the broad criteria for awarding the vouchers gives Makary and other FDA officials unprecedented discretion in deciding which companies will benefit from the sped-up reviews.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "California to begin selling affordable state-branded insulin beginning next year\nCalifornia to begin selling affordable state-branded insulin beginning next year\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that California will begin selling affordable insulin under its own label on Jan. 1, nearly three years after he first announced a partnership to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices.\nBut California won’t be the only state making lower-cost insulin available. The nonprofit Civica said it will also distribute its economical diabetes medication to pharmacies nationwide. California began partnering with Civica in 2023 for its “CalRx” brand of insulin and put $50 million toward its development, the company said.\nStarting in the new year, insulin pens will be available at a recommended price of $11 per pen, or a maximum of $55 for a five-pack, Civica said.\n“You don’t need a new prescription,” Newsom said at a news conference in Los Angeles. “It’s access on the basis of affordability.”\nIt is one piece of California’s effort to lower prescription drug costs by offering generics as a cheaper alternative. Newsom announced in April that the state will sell the overdose medication Naloxone. The drug, available as a nasal spray and in an injectable form, is considered a key tool in the battle against a nationwide overdose crisis.\nFor the insulin development, the state entered a 10-year deal with Civica and Biocon Biologics in early 2023. Officials said then that they hoped California’s emergence as an insulin-maker would prompt prices to collapse.\nThe new pens will be interchangeable with glargine, the generic alternative for more expensive once-a-day injections that regulates blood sugar. As a comparison, the equivalent of a five-pack of Eli Lilly’s Rezvoglar sells to pharmacies for more than $88, according to data compiled by the governor’s office, but consumers may pay a different price based on their insurance.\nAbout 38 million Americans — and roughly 3.5 million Californians — have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.\nChris Noble, organizing director of Health Access California, a statewide consumer health care advocacy group, welcomed Newsom’s announcement, saying efforts by California and others to develop a competing generic will bring relief to patients who have seen drug prices spike in recent years.\n“California consumers need relief now, so health advocates are relieved to see CalRx moving quickly to lower insulin costs for the people of California while continuing to pursue other needed prescription drug cost solutions,” Noble said in a statement Thursday.\nThere could be risks. State analysts have warned that California’s entry into the market could prompt other manufacturers to reduce the availability of their drugs, a potential unintended consequence.\nState lawmakers approved $100 million for the project in 2022, with $50 million dedicated to developing three types of insulin and the rest set aside to invest in a manufacturing facility.\nAccording to state documents from 2023, the proposed program could save many patients between $2,000 and $4,000 a year. In addition, lower costs could result in substantial savings because the state buys the product every year for the millions of people on its publicly funded health plans.",

    "body": "Scientists hope underwater fiber-optic cables can help save endangered orcas\nScientists hope underwater fiber-optic cables can help save endangered orcas\nSAN JUAN ISLAND, Wash. (AP) — As dawn broke over San Juan Island, a team of scientists stood on the deck of a barge and unspooled over a mile of fiber-optic cable into the frigid waters of the Salish Sea. Working by headlamp, they fed the line from the rocky shore down to the seafloor — home to the region’s orcas.\nThe bet is that the same hair-thin strands that carry internet signals can be transformed into a continuous underwater microphone to capture the clicks, calls and whistles of passing whales — information that could reveal how they respond to ship traffic, food scarcity and climate change. If the experiment works, the thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables that already crisscross the ocean floor could be turned into a vast listening network that could inform conservation efforts worldwide.\nThe technology, called Distributed Acoustic Sensing, or DAS, was developed to monitor pipelines and detect infrastructure problems. Now University of Washington scientists are adapting it to listen to the ocean. Unlike traditional hydrophones that listen from a single spot, DAS turns the entire cable into a sensor, allowing it to pinpoint the exact location of an animal and determine the direction it’s heading.\n“We can imagine that we have thousands of hydrophones along the cable recording data continuously,” said Shima Abadi, professor at the University of Washington Bothell School of STEM and the University of Washington School of Oceanography. “We can know where the animals are and learn about their migration patterns much better than hydrophones.”\nThe researchers have already proven the technology works with large baleen whales. In a test off the Oregon coast, they recorded the low-frequency rumblings of fin whales and blue whales using existing telecommunications cables.\nBut orcas present a bigger challenge: Their clicks and calls operate at high frequencies at which the technology hasn’t yet been tested.\nScientists recently deployed about 1 mile of fiber-optic cable in the Salish Sea to test whether internet cables can monitor endangered orcas. If successful, the world’s 870,000 miles of existing undersea cables could become a vast ocean monitoring network. (Video by Annika Hammerschlag. Produced by Brittany Peterson)\nFighting for survival\nThe stakes are high. The Southern Resident orcas that frequent the Salish Sea are endangered, with a population hovering around 75. The whales face a triple threat: underwater noise pollution, toxic contaminants and food scarcity.\n“We have an endangered killer whale trying to eat an endangered salmon species,” said Scott Veirs, president of Beam Reach Marine Science and Sustainability, an organization that develops open-source acoustic systems for whale conservation.\nThe Chinook salmon that orcas depend on have declined dramatically. Since the Pacific Salmon Commission began tracking numbers in 1984, populations have dropped 60% due to habitat loss, overfishing, dams and climate change.\nOrcas use echolocation – rapid clicks that bounce off objects – to find salmon in murky water. Ship noise can mask those clicks, making it difficult for them to hunt.\nIf DAS works as hoped, it could give conservationists real-time information to protect the whales. For instance, if the system detects orcas heading south toward Seattle and calculates their travel speed, scientists could alert Washington State Ferries to postpone noisy activities or to slow down until the whales pass.\n“It will for sure help with dynamic management and long-term policy that will have real benefits for the whales,” Veirs said.\nThe technology would also answer basic questions about orca behavior that have eluded scientists, such as determining whether their communication changes when they’re in different behavioral states and how they hunt together. It could even enable researchers to identify which sound is coming from a particular whale — a kind of voice recognition for orcas.\nBeyond the Salish Sea\nThe implications extend far beyond the Salish Sea. With some 870,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) of fiber-optic cables already installed underwater globally, the infrastructure for ocean monitoring largely exists. It just needs to be tapped.\n“One of the most important challenges for managing wildlife, conserving biodiversity and combating climate change is that there’s just a lack of data overall,” said Yuta Masuda, director of science at Allen Family Philanthropies, which helped fund the project.\nThe timing is critical. The High Seas Treaty enters into force in January, which will allow for new marine protected areas in international waters. But scientists still don’t understand how human activities affect most ocean species or where protections are most needed. A dataset as vast as the one the global web of submarine cables could provide might help determine which areas should be prioritized for protection.\n“We think this has a lot of promise to fill in those key data gaps,” Masuda said.\nBack on the barge, the team faced a delicate task: fusing two fibers together above the rolling swell. They struggled to align the strands in a fusion splicer, a device that precisely positions the fiber ends before melting them together with an electric current. The boat rocked. They steadied their hands and tried again, and again. Finally, the weld held.\nData soon began flowing to a computer on shore, appearing as waterfall plots — cascading visualizations that show sound frequencies over time. Nearby, cameras trained on the water stood ready so that if a vocalization was detected, researchers could link a behavior with a specific call.\nAll that was left was to sit and wait for orcas.\n___\nFollow Annika Hammerschlag on Instagram @ahammergram.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

    "body": "UN warns Colombia over mercury contamination in Atrato River, calls crisis a human rights emergency\nThe United Nations warned that mercury contamination from illegal gold mining in Colombia’s Atrato River basin has created a “serious and ongoing human rights crisis,” threatening the health and survival of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities.\nBOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The United Nations warned that mercury contamination from illegal gold mining in Colombia’s Atrato River basin has created a “serious and ongoing human rights crisis,” threatening the health and survival of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities who depend on the river for food, water and culture.\nIn a letter made public on Tuesday, three U.N. Human Rights Council special rapporteurs raised concerns with the Colombian government about insufficient compliance with a 2016 Constitutional Court ruling that recognized the Atrato River as a legal entity with rights to protection and restoration.\n“Ten years have passed and we have seen that there has been insufficient implementation and compliance with the terms of that decision,” Marcos Orellana, the U.N. special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, told The Associated Press. “A big part of the problem stems from the presence of organized crime — smuggling mercury, smuggling gold, and corruption in military and police forces.”\nThe Atrato River, one of Colombia’s largest waterways, winds nearly 500 miles from the western Andes to the Caribbean Sea through the lush jungles of Choco, one of the country’s most biodiverse yet impoverished regions. It’s home to predominantly Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities that rely on fishing and small-scale farming — livelihoods now imperiled by toxic pollution.\nIllegal gold mining is now among the main drivers of deforestation and pollution across many of Latin America’s Amazon regions. Soaring gold prices and weak traceability systems have fueled demand for illicitly mined gold that often slips into global supply chains. The mercury used to extract the metal has devastated wildlife — including river dolphins and fish — and contaminated the food sources of Indigenous communities in remote areas of the Amazon.\nMore than a third of population exposed to mercu\nry\nAP reporting last year showed how local residents — charged with safeguarding the river — act as watchguards of illegal mining and the health of the river, often under threat from armed groups.\nOrellana said the U.N. received evidence showing that more than a third of the population in the Atrato watershed has been exposed to mercury levels exceeding World Health Organization limits. He called the situation “incredibly concerning,” citing the metal’s extreme toxicity and its ability to cause neurological damage, organ failure and developmental disorders in unborn children.\nThe 2016 court ruling was hailed globally as a milestone in environmental law, inspiring similar “rights of nature” initiatives elsewhere. But Orellana said political turnover, lack of funding and alleged corruption have undermined enforcement.\n“Complying with a court decision requires institutional commitment over the long term,” he said. “Politics can interfere, and reality kicks in when budgets don’t follow.”\nThe letter — cosigned by the special rapporteur on the right to a healthy environment and the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent — was sent to the Colombian government more than 60 days ago, Orellana said, but has not yet received a response. Under standard U.N. procedures, governments are given 60 days to reply to such communications before they are made public.\n“It is my expectation that the government will reply, giving effect to its obligations under international human rights law,” he said.\nColombia’s presidential office and Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIllegal mining linked to slavery, prostitution and displacement\nIn their communication, the U.N. rapporteurs described the mercury contamination as a violation of the rights to health, life and a clean environment. They urged Colombia to take “immediate and effective” steps to curb illegal mining, clean up polluted sites and provide medical care for affected communities.\nMercury is commonly used in small-scale gold mining to separate gold from sediment, but when released into rivers it poisons fish and builds up in human tissue. Colombia banned mercury use in mining in 2018, yet enforcement remains weak — especially in conflict zones dominated by armed groups and criminal networks.\nOrellana said his office has received evidence of slavery like labor, forced prostitution and displacement linked to illegal mining operations in the Atrato region.\n“These forms of violence and violations of human rights accompany mercury contamination and must be treated as environmental crimes,” he said.\nHe urged Colombia to take a leading role in strengthening international mercury controls under the Minamata Convention on Mercury, saying current global regulations have “gaps that need to be closed” to curb cross-border trade.\nMeaningful progress, Orellana added, would mean seeing a decline in the number of hectares being mined — which has increased since the 2016 ruling — and ensuring communities have access not just to testing but to specialized health care and clear guidance on how to reduce exposure.\n“The human rights of victims are at stake,” he said. “International law requires states to respect and guarantee rights — not for one day or for one week, but all the time.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "In Iceland, a town still shaken by volcanic eruptions tries to recover\nNine volcanic eruptions since December 2023 have shaken the Icelandic town of Grindavik and forced residents to repeatedly evacuate. Most people have moved away, but some have stayed. They are exhausted by disruptions but hope life can return to normal. (AP Video: Marco Di Marco/Production Aya Diab)\nGRINDAVIK, Iceland (AP) — Vignir Kristinsson smiles as two women, the only customers all morning, enter his gift shop filled with handmade things of oak. After perusing decorations ranging from animals to kitchen cutting boards, one woman bought a small black-stained tree.\nAfter decades of making cabinets for a living, Kristinsson, 64, said his daughter persuaded him to turn passion for woodworking into a business. Five years ago he and his wife opened the shop in Grindavik, a coastal town of 3,800 people about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik. Business was good.\nThen the volcanic eruptions began.\nSince December 2023, nine eruptions near Grindavik have forced residents to repeatedly evacuate, with authorities closing the town for periods ranging from a few days to months.\n“I’m supposed to run a business when people are told they should not come,” Kristinsson said. “How is that possible?”\nIceland is known for volcanoes\nIcelanders are no strangers to eruptions. The ones near Grindavik have come from the Sundhnuksgígar crater row, a series of volcanic fissures that are part of the Svartsengi volcanic system, in the Reykjanes Peninsula.\nBefore the first eruption nearly two years ago, the system had been dormant for 783 years.\nScientists say the volcanic activity is not over. The Icelandic Meteorological Office, which monitors volcanoes, in September said a 10th eruption was likely in the months ahead. It’s impossible to know how long the activity may last.\nResidents say they are used to the constant stress.\n“When we had to leave, we had five minutes to get our stuff,” said Kristólína Ósk Guðjónsdóttir, 18, recalling the first evacuation in November 2023.\nSince then, Guðjónsdóttir has been going to a high school in Keflavik, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) north of Grindavik. She said it’s been hard for friends to keep a sense of community with schools shuttered.\n“I know many kids want to come back,” she said.\nEmpty houses, but signs of recovery\nIn parts of Grindavík and surrounding areas, lava has buried roads and houses, leaving sharp rocks which smolder for months. The intense shaking during eruptions, caused by the movement of magma intrusions underground, has left large fissures in the ground along with cracks in roads and houses.\nWhile most residents have moved away, some have stayed. They are both exhausted by the disruptions and hopeful that life can eventually return to normal.\nBut that feels far off. Most businesses are closed. Tourists may be the biggest sign of human activity. They fly drones over vast lava beds outside Grindavik and explore the town and its damage.\nStill, there are modest signs of recovery. The local professional basketball team recently began playing games in the town again, and authorities are discussing the possibility of opening schools next year. Local news reports say more residents are returning, though it’s not clear know how many.\nAn interview request to the mayor’s office was not answered.\nFormer residents weigh what to do with homes\nBeginning in early 2024, residents said the government offered to buy their houses, a deal that many have taken. It gave them three years to decide whether to buy them back. The government has not made the same offer for commercial properties.\nDecisions on whether to buy back homes likely will depend on many factors, including how much their lives have moved on elsewhere.\nKristinsson, the craftsman, said his wife has made clear she does not want to move back to Grindavik. After living in their daughter’s garage for a month, then a cousin’s apartment for six months, the couple bought a house in Hafnarfjordur, 42 kilometers (26 miles) northeast of Grindavik.\nKristinsson comes to Grindavik to open his store and sometimes spend the night there when he is able to rent to tourists an apartment he built on the second floor. He called that income a lifeline.\n“People who live here now want to see things come back faster,” he said.\nFor Sigurður Enoksson, 60-year-old owner of Herastubbur Bakari, a bakery, the decision on whether to buy back their house is an easy one: No.\nWhile discussing their decision on a recent day, Enoksson and his wife showed cell phone photos of the cracks in the walls. They now live in Kopavogur, about 47 kilometers (29 miles) northeast of Grindavik.\nBut the family will remain committed to the town through their bakery, which just celebrated its 30th anniversary. To survive, the business has reduced staffing from 13 people to three: Enoksson, his wife and one son.\nKnowing how much to bake is a challenge. Some days they sell everything. Other days they are forced to give pastries away.\n“There are not always customers each day,” Enoksson said. “We are trying our best.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "Nations meet to consider regulations to drive a green transition in shipping\nThe world’s largest maritime nations are gathering in London on Tuesday to consider adopting regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions.\nThe world’s largest maritime nations gathered in London on Tuesday to consider adopting regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions.\nIf the deal is adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.\nNations are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters through Friday. The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the climate deal.\nIn April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework. The aim is to adopt it at this meeting.\nThat would be a major win for the climate, public health, the ocean and marine life, said Delaine McCullough at the Ocean Conservancy. For too long, ships have run on crude, dirty oil, she said.\n“This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible,” said McCullough, shipping program director for the nonprofit environmental advocacy group.\n“The energy and digital transition of shipping have already started. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long run,” said Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the IMO, during his opening remarks at the meeting.\nShipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.\nHere’s what to know:\nThe regulations would set a pricing system for gas emissions\nThe regulations, or “Net-zero Framework,” set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere’s a base level of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels. There’s a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity.\nIf ships sail on fuels with lower emissions than what’s required under the direct compliance target, they earn “surplus units,” effectively credits.\nShips with the highest emissions would have to buy those credits from other ships under the pricing system, or from the IMO at $380 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach the base level of compliance. In addition, there’s a penalty of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.\nShips that meet the base target but not the direct compliance one must pay the $100 per ton penalty too.\nShips whose greenhouse gas intensity is below a certain threshold will receive rewards for their performance.\nThe fees could generate $11 billion to $13 billion in revenue annually. That would go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to green shipping, reward low-emission ships and support developing countries so they aren’t left behind with dirty fuels and old ships.\nLooking for alternative fuels\nThe IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.\nShips could lower their emissions by using alternative fuels, running on electricity or using onboard carbon capture technologies. Wind propulsion and other energy efficiency advancements can also help reduce fuel consumption and emissions as part of an energy transition.\nLarge ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to reach net-zero around 2050.\nIf adopted, the regulations will enter into force in 2027. Large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, would have to pay penalties for their emissions starting in 2028, according to the IMO.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption.\nConcerns over biofuels produced from food crops\nHeavy fuel oil, liquefied natural gas and biodiesel will be dominant for most of the 2030s and 2040s, unless the IMO further incentivizes green alternatives, according to modeling from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.\nThe way the rules are designed essentially makes biofuels the cheapest fuel to use to comply, but biofuels require huge amounts of crops, pushing out less profitable food production, often leading to additional land clearance and deforestation, said Faig Abbasov, shipping director at T&E.\nThey are urging the IMO to promote scalable green alternatives, not recklessly promote biofuels produced from food crops, Abbasov said. As it stands now, the deal before the IMO won’t deliver net-zero emissions by 2050, he added.\nGreen ammonia will get to a price that it’s appealing to ship owners in the late 2040s — quite late in the transition, according to the modeling. The NGO also sees green methanol playing an important role in the long-term transition.\nThe vote at the London meeting\nThe IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but it’s likely nations will vote on adopting the regulations.\nAt the April meeting, a vote was called to approve the contents of the regulations. The United States was notably absent in April, but plans to participate in this meeting.\nDuring the opening session on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Russia and a few other countries intervened to express their reservations about the meeting’s agenda, which strongly focuses on adopting the Net-zero Framework by the end of the week.\nTeresa Bui at Pacific Environment said she is optimistic “global momentum is on our side” and a majority of countries will support adoption. Bui is senior climate campaign director for the environmental nonprofit, which has consultative, or non-voting, status at the IMO.\nIf it fails, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed.\n“It’s difficult to know for sure what the precise consequences will be, but failure this week will certainly lead to delay, which means ships will emit more greenhouse gases than they would have done and for longer, continuing their outsized contribution to the climate crisis,” said John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, who is at the London meeting.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "FACT FOCUS: With a truce in Israel, Trump now says he’s ended eight wars. His numbers are off\nFACT FOCUS: With a truce in Israel, Trump now says he’s ended eight wars. His numbers are off\nAs Israel and Hamas traded hostages and prisoners on Monday, taking a first step toward peace, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, telling them he had ended his eighth war.\n“After so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm. The guns are silent. The sirens are still. And the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace,” Trump said.\nHe then upped the number of wars he claims to have ended in his first eight months in office, saying, “Yesterday I was saying seven, but now I can say eight.”\nBut Trump’s claim is exaggerated. Much work remains before an end to the war between Israel and Hamas can be declared. That’s also true in other countries where Trump claims to have ended wars.\nHere’s a closer look:\nIsrael and Hamas\nWhile the ceasefire and hostage deal is a major achievement, it is still an early and delicate moment in the path to a permanent end to the war, let alone a two state solution.\nThe first steps of the agreement Trump brokered included the release of hostages in Gaza, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a surge of humanitarian aid and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza’s main cities.\nBut major elements remain to be worked out.\nAfter his stop in Israel, Trump gathered with other world leaders in Egypt for a “ Summit of Peace ” to discuss the ceasefire plan. Trump acknowledged that leaders had taken the “first steps to peace” and urged leaders to build on the breakthrough. Trump and other leaders signed a document that he said would “spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things, and it’s very comprehensive,” though details were not immediately available.\nThe next phase of talks is expected to address disarming Hamas, creating a post-war government for Gaza, reconstruction, and the extent of Israel’s withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s plan also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop a new Palestinian security force.\nAt least some, if not all, of those elements need to be worked out, and negotiations over those issues could break down. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said on Monday that he and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, were “already working” on implementation issues.\nIsrael and Iran\nTrump is credited with ending the 12-day war.\nIn June, Israel launched attacks on the heart of Iran’s nuclear program and military leadership, saying it wanted to stop Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has denied it was trying to do that.\nTrump negotiated a ceasefire after directing American warplanes to strike Iran’s Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites.\nEvelyn Farkas, executive director of Arizona State University’s McCain Institute, said that Trump should get credit for ending the war.\n“There’s always a chance it could flare up again if Iran restarts its nuclear weapons program, but nonetheless, they were engaged in a hot war with one another,” she said. “And it didn’t have any real end in sight before President Trump got involved and gave them an ultimatum.”\nLawrence Haas, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council who is an expert on Israel-Iran tensions, agreed the U.S. was instrumental in securing the ceasefire. But he characterized it as a “temporary respite” from the ongoing “day-to-day cold war” between the two countries that often involves flare-ups.\nEgypt and Ethiopia\nThis could be described as tensions at best, and peace efforts, which do not directly involve the United States, have stalled.\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River has caused friction between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan since the power-generating project was announced more than a decade ago. In July, Ethiopia declared the project complete. It was inaugurated in September.\nEgypt and Sudan oppose the dam. Although the vast majority of the water that flows down the Nile originates in Ethiopia, Egyptian agriculture relies on the river almost entirely. Sudan fears flooding and wants to protect its own power-generating dams.\nDuring his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt. He could not get the countries to agree and suspended aid to Ethiopia over the dispute. In July, he posted on social media that he helped the “fight over the massive dam (and) there is peace at least for now.” But the disagreement persists, and negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have stalled.\n“It would be a gross overstatement to say that these countries are at war,” Haas said. “I mean, they’re just not.”\nIndia and Pakistan\nThe April killing of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir pushed India and Pakistan closer to war than they had been in years, but a ceasefire was reached.\nTrump has claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire, which he said came about in part because he offered trade concessions. Pakistan thanked Trump, recommending him for the Nobel Peace Prize. India has denied Trump’s claims, saying there was no conversation between the U.S. and India on trade in regards to the ceasefire.\nAlthough India played down the Trump administration’s role in the ceasefire, Haas and Farkas believe the U.S. deserves some credit for helping stop the fighting.\n“I think that President Trump played a constructive role from all accounts, but it may not have been decisive. And again, I’m not sure whether you would define that as a full-blown war,” Farkas said.\nSerbia and Kosovo\nThe White House lists the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo as one Trump resolved. But there has been no threat of a war between the two neighbors during Trump’s second term or any significant contribution from the Republican president this year to improve relations.\nKosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Tensions have persisted since, but never to the point of war, mostly because NATO-led peacekeepers have been deployed in Kosovo, which has been recognized by more than 100 countries.\nDuring his first term, Trump negotiated a wide-ranging deal between the countries, but much of what was agreed on was never carried out.\nRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nTrump has played a key role in peace efforts between the African neighbors, but he is hardly alone and the conflict is far from over.\nEastern Congo, rich in minerals, has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is the M23 rebel group. It is backed by neighboring Rwanda, which claims that it is protecting its territorial interests and that some of those who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide fled to Congo and are working with the Congolese army.\nThe Trump administration’s efforts paid off in June, when the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a peace deal at the White House. The M23, however, was not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and said it would not abide by the terms of an agreement that did not involve it.\nThe final step to peace was meant to be a Qatar-facilitated deal between Congo and M23 that would bring about a permanent ceasefire as well as a final agreement to be signed separately between Congo and Rwanda as facilitated by the administration. However, talks have stalled between the different parties amid setbacks, and deadly fighting continues in eastern Congo.\nArmenia and Azerbaijan\nIn August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House, where they signed a deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the signed document a “significant milestone.” Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed Trump for performing “a miracle.”\nThe agreements were intended to reopen key transportation routes and reaffirm Armenia’s and Azerbaijan’s commitment to signing a peace treaty. The treaty’s text was initialed by the countries’ foreign ministers at that meeting, which indicated preliminary approval. But the two countries have yet to sign and ratify the deal.\nArmenia and Azerbaijan have been in a bitter conflict over territory since the early 1990s, when ethnic Armenian forces took control of the Karabakh province, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, and nearby territories. In 2020, Azerbaijan’s military recaptured broad swaths of territory. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.\nIn September 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a lightning blitz to retake remaining portions. The two countries have worked toward normalizing ties and signing a peace treaty ever since.\nCambodia and Thailand\nOfficials from Thailand and Cambodia credit Trump with pushing the Asian neighbors to agree to a ceasefire in this summer’s brief border conflict.\nCambodia and Thailand clashed in the past over their shared border. The latest fighting began in July after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Tensions had been growing since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thai politics.\nBoth countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia.\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened. Trump said on social media that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., though most of their Southeast Asian neighbors had.\nAccording to Ken Lohatepanont, a political analyst and University of Michigan doctoral candidate, “President Trump’s decision to condition a successful conclusion to these talks on a ceasefire likely played a significant role in ensuring that both sides came to the negotiating table when they did.”\n___\nAssociated Press writers Michelle Price, Chinedu Asadu, Melissa Goldin, Jon Gambrell, Grant Peck, Dasha Litvinova, Fay Abuelgasim, Rajesh Roy, and Dusan Stojanovic contributed to this report. ___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.",

    "body": "FACT FOCUS: Trump paints a grim portrait of Portland. The story on the ground is much less extreme\nFACT FOCUS: Trump paints a grim portrait of Portland. The story on the ground is much less extreme\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — President Donald Trump, members of his administration and conservative influencers painted a bleak portrait of Portland, Oregon, at a roundtable event at the White House Wednesday, alleging that the city has been besieged by violence perpetrated by “antifa thugs” and that it is essentially a war zone.\n“It should be clear to all Americans that we have a very serious left-wing terror threat in our country, radicals associated with the domestic terror group antifa that you’ve heard a lot about lately,” Trump said.\nBut the reality on the ground in Portland is far from the extremes described at the White House.\nHere’s a closer look at the facts.\nThe protests\nTRUMP: “In Portland, Oregon, antifa thugs have repeatedly attacked our offices and laid siege to federal property in an attempt to violently stop the execution of federal law.”\nTHE FACTS: There have been nightly protests outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland for months, peaking in June when police declared one demonstration a riot. There have also been smaller clashes since then: On Labor Day, some demonstrators brought a prop guillotine — a display the U.S. Department of Homeland Security blasted as “unhinged behavior.”\nThe protests at the ICE facility, which is outside downtown, have largely been confined to one city block and have attracted a range of participants. During the day, a handful of immigration and legal advocates mill about and offer copies of “know your rights” flyers. Daytime marches to the building have also included older people and families with young children. At night, other protesters arrive, often using megaphones to shout obscenities at law enforcement.\nWhile the administration claims protesters are antifa, short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for decentralized far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.\nThe building was closed for three weeks from mid-June to early July because of damage to windows, security cameras, gates and other parts of the facility, federal officials said in court filings submitted in response to a lawsuit brought by Portland and Oregon seeking to block the Trump administration’s deployment of the National Guard. The building’s main entrance and ground-floor windows have been boarded up.\nProtesters have also sought to block vehicles from entering and leaving the facility. Federal officials argue that this has impeded law enforcement operations and forced more personnel and resources to be sent from other parts of the country.\nHowever, in the weeks leading up to the Trump administration’s move to federalize 200 members of the Oregon National Guard on Sept. 28, most nights drew a couple dozen people, Portland police correspondence submitted to the court shows.\nProtests began growing again after the National Guard was ordered to Portland over the objections of local and state officials.\nSince June, Portland police have arrested at least 45 people, with the majority of those arrests taking place in June. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have charged at least 31 people with crimes committed at the building, including assaulting federal officers; 22 of those defendants had been charged by early July.\nIs Portland on fire?\nTRUMP: “The amazing thing is, you look at Portland and you see fires all over the place. You see fights, and I mean just violence. It’s just so crazy. And then you talk to the governor and she acts like everything is totally normal, there’s nothing wrong.”\nTHE FACTS: Fires outside the building have been seen on a handful of occasions. In June, a man was arrested after he lit a flare and tossed it onto a pile of materials stacked against the vehicle gate, according to federal prosecutors, who said the fire was fully extinguished within minutes.\nMore recently, social media videos of the Labor Day protest showed a small fire lit on the prop guillotine. And in early October, following the announcement of the National Guard’s mobilization, videos on social media showed a protester holding an American flag on fire — and conservative influencer Nick Sortor stomping the fire out.\nThere have also been some high-profile confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters. In late September, conservative media figure Katie Daviscourt was hit in the face with a flagpole and suffered a laceration, police logs show. In early October, Sortor, who has more than 1 million followers on X, was arrested along with two other protesters following an altercation. Local prosecutors ultimately declined to charge him after finding that one of the protesters had pushed him and that “any physical contact he had with other persons was defensive in nature.”\nWhile Portland police correspondence submitted to the court notes a few instances of “active” energy and disturbances between protesters and counterprotesters, many entries describe low energy and “no issues” in the weeks leading up to the National Guard’s mobilization.\nA new tongue-in-cheek website has also launched in recent days: isportlandburning.com shows multiple live cameras in the city and near-real-time data from the city’s fire department.\nShops and sewers\nTRUMP: “I don’t know what could be worse than Portland. You don’t even have sewers anymore. They don’t even put glass up. They put plywood on their windows. But most of the retailers have left.”\nTHE FACTS: This is false. Portland does have sewers — its sewer and stormwater system “includes more than 2,500 miles of pipes, nearly 100 pump stations, and two treatment plants,” according to the city’s website. The largest sewer pipe is the East Side Big Pipe, which has an inside diameter of 22 feet, while the smallest are only six inches in diameter.\nLocal and state officials have suggested that many of Trump’s claims appear to rely on images from 2020. Portland famously erupted in more than 100 days of large-scale unrest and violent protests after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police that year. Police were unable to keep ahead of splinter groups of black-clad protesters who broke off and roamed the downtown area, at times breaking windows, spraying graffiti and setting small fires.\nBut Portland has largely recovered from that time. Under a new mayor and police chief, the city has reduced crime, and the downtown — which has more than 600 retail shops, many with glass storefronts — has seen a decrease in homeless encampments and increased foot traffic. This summer was reportedly the busiest for pedestrian traffic since before the coronavirus pandemic, and a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024.\nGov. Tina Kotek said she told Trump during a phone call that “we have to be careful not to respond to outdated media coverage or misinformation that is out there.”\nAccusation of a cover-up\nKRISTI NOEM, Homeland Security Secretary: “I was in Portland yesterday and had the chance to visit with the governor of Oregon, and also the mayor there in town, and they are absolutely covering up the terrorism that is hitting their streets.”\nTHE FACTS: Noem did visit Portland on Tuesday and met with Kotek and Mayor Keith Wilson. Both officials disagree with Noem’s narrative.\nKotek has repeatedly said that “there is no insurrection in Portland,” including in conversations with Trump and Noem, and that the city does not need “military intervention.” She has also continually called for any protests to be peaceful and said that local law enforcement can “meet the moment.” After Trump threatened to send the National Guard to Portland, Wilson said in a statement that the city has protected freedom of expression while “addressing occasional violence and property destruction.”\nObservations on the ground in Portland support Kotek’s statement. While the nightly protests at the ICE facility have been disruptive for nearby residents — a charter school relocated this summer to get away from crowd-control devices — life has continued as normal in the rest of the city. There is no evidence of the protests in other areas of the city, including the downtown area about two miles away.\nPortland residents have taken to social media to push back against the Trump administration’s statements about their city with the hashtag #WarRavagedPortland, posting photos and videos that show protesters in inflatable unicorn and frog costumes, along with people walking their dogs, riding their bikes and shopping at farmers markets.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.",

    "body": "No, Taylor Swift did not turn down the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show\nNEW YORK (AP) — Taylor Swift says she did not turn down the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, which will be headlined by Bad Bunny.\n“The Life of a Showgirl” singer paid a visit to “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Monday and dispelled a few rumors. Most notably, she shared she did not turn down the NFL’s biggest stage because she wouldn’t be allowed to own the performance footage, as claimed in a popular internet rumor.\n“No, no, no,” Swift said.\nThe Super Bowl halftime show is produced by the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation — the latter founded by music mogul Jay-Z.\n“Jay-Z has always been very good to me. Our teams are really close. Like, they sometimes will call and say, ‘How does she feel about the Super Bowl?’ And that’s not like an official offer or, like, an official conference room conversation,” Swift told Fallon. “We’re always able to tell him the truth, which is that, like, I am in love with a guy who does that sport on that actual field,” she continued, referring to fiance Travis Kelce — a star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs and a Super Bowl champion.\n“Like, that is violent chess. That is gladiators without swords. That is dangerous. The whole season I am locked in on what that man is doing on the field,” she said.\n“Can you imagine if he’s out there every single week, like putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high pressure, high intensity sport and I’m like, ‘I wonder what my choreo(graphy) should be?,’” Swift joked.\n“‘I think we should do two verses of ‘Shake It Off’ into ‘Blank Space’ into ‘Cruel Summer’ would be great.’ And this is nothing to do with Travis, he would love for me to do it, I’m just too locked in.”\nLast month, it was announced that global superstar Bad Bunny will bring his Latin trap, reggaeton swagger and Puerto Rican pride to the Super Bowl live from Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California.\nIt’s an ideal casting: Bad Bunny is fresh off a historic Puerto Rico residency that drew more than half a million fans and is leading all nominees at the Latin Grammys in November.\n“What I’m feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement. “It’s for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history.”\nOn Saturday, Bad Bunny hosted the season 51 premiere of “Saturday Night Live” with a few jokes about his forthcoming Super Bowl halftime show.",

    "body": "Trump says the US has secured $17 trillion in new investments. The real number is likely much less\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The economic boom promised by President Donald Trump centers on a single number: $17 trillion.\nThat’s the sum of new investments that Trump claims to have generated with his tariffs, income tax cuts and aggressive salesmanship of CEOs, financiers, tech titans, prime ministers, presidents and other rulers. The $17 trillion is supposed to fund new factories, new technologies, more jobs, higher incomes and faster economic growth.\n“Under eight months of Trump, we’ve already secured commitments of $17 trillion coming in,” the president said in a speech last month. “There’s never been any country that’s done anything like that.”\nBut based on statements from various companies, foreign countries and the White House’s own website, that figure appears to be exaggerated, highly speculative and far higher than the actual sum. The White House website lists total investments at $8.8 trillion, though that figure appears to be padded with some investment commitments made during Joe Biden’s presidency.\nThe White House didn’t lay out the math after multiple requests as to how Trump calculated $17 trillion in investment commitments. But the issue goes beyond Trump’s hyperbolic talk to his belief that the brute force of tariffs and shaming of companies can deliver economic results, a strategy that could go sideways for him politically if the tough talk fails to translate into more jobs and higher incomes.\nJust 37% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a September poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That’s down from a peak of 56% in early 2020 during Trump’s first term — a memory he relied upon when courting voters in last year’s election.\nAdam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said the public commitments announced by Trump do represent a “meaningful increase” — but one that amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars, not trillions. Even then, that comes with long-term costs as countries might be less inclined to invest with the U.S. after being threatened to do so.\n“It is a national security mistake because you’re turning allies into colonies of a sort — you’re forcibly extracting from them things that they don’t see as entirely in their interest,” Posen said. “Twisting the arms of governments to then twist the arms of their own businesses is not going to get you the payoff you want.”\nTrump banking on foreign countries making good on promises\nThe Trump administration is betting that tariffs are an effective tool to prod other countries and international companies to invest in the United States, a big stick that other administrations failed to wield. Trump’s pitch to voters is that he will play a role in directly managing the investment commitments made by foreign countries — and that the allocation of that money starting next year will revive what has been a flagging job market.\n“The difference between hypothetical investments and ground being broken on new factories and facilities is good leadership and sound policy,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai.\nThe White House said that Japan will invest $1 trillion, largely at Trump’s direction. The European Union will commit $600 billion. The United Arab Emirates made commitments of $1.4 trillion over 10 years. Qatar pledged $1.2 trillion. Saudi Arabia intends to pony up $600 billion, India $500 billion and South Korea $450 billion, among others.\nThe challenge is the precise terms of those investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute, potentially fuzzy math or, in the case of Qatar, more than five times the annual gross domestic product of the entire country. The White House maintains that Qatar is good for the money because it produces oil.\nSouth Korea already has misgivings about its investment commitment, which is $100 billion lower than what the White House claims, after immigration agents raided a Hyundai plant under construction in Georgia and arrested Korean citizens. There are also concerns that an investment that large without a better way to exchange currencies with the U.S. could hurt South Korea’s economy.\n“From what I’ve seen, these commitments are worth about as much as the paper they’re not written down on,” said Jared Bernstein, who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Biden White House.\nAs for the $600 billion committed by European companies, that’s based on those businesses having “expressed interest” and having stated “intentions” to do so through 2029 rather than an overt concession, according to European Union documents.\nStill too soon to see any investment impact in overall economy\nSo far, there has yet to be a notable boost in business investment as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product. As a share of the overall economy, business investment during the first six months of Trump’s presidency has been consistently bouncing around 14%, just as it was before the pandemic.\nBut economists also note that Trump is double-counting and relying on investments that were initially announced during the Biden administration or investments that were already likely to occur because of the artificial intelligence build out.\nFor example, the White House lists a $16 billion investment by computer chipmaker Global Foundries. But of that sum, more than $13 billion was announced during the Biden administration and supported by $1.6 billion in grants by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, as well as other state and federal incentives.\nSimilarly, the White House is banking on $200 billion being invested by the chipmaker Micron, but at least $120 billion of that was announced during the Biden era.\n‘The tariffs played a big role’\nFor their part, White House officials largely credit Trump’s tariffs — like those imposed on Oct. 1 on kitchen cabinets, large trucks and pharmaceutical drugs — for forcing companies to make investments in the U.S., saying that the risk of additional import taxes if countries and companies fail to deliver on their promises will ensure that the promised cash comes into the economy.\nOn Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla endorsed this approach after his pharmaceutical drug company received a three-year grace period on tariffs and announced $70 billion in investments in the U.S.\n“The president was absolutely right,” Bourla said. “Tariffs is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors.”\n“The tariffs played a big role,” Trump added.",

(AP) — A South Carolina inmate who killed a man, burned his eyes with cigarettes and then painted “catch me if u can” on the wall with the victim’s blood more than 20 years ago has been scheduled to be executed next month.\nThe state Supreme Court issued the death warrant Friday for Stephen Bryant, 44. The court denied a request from Bryant’s lawyers, who asked for a delay because they work with the federal court system and the U.S. government is shut down.\nWhile Bryant is being put to death Nov. 14 for one killing, prosecutors said he also shot and killed two other men he was giving rides to as they were reliving themselves on the side of the road during a few weeks that terrorized Sumter County in October 2004.\nBryant will be the 50th person executed in South Carolina since the state restarted the death penalty in 1985 and the seventh inmate put to death in less than 14 months since the state was able to obtain a drug for lethal injection and reopen the death chamber after an unintentional 13-year pause.\nBryant will have until Oct. 31 to choose if he wants to die by lethal injection, firing squad or in the electric chair. Since the long pause, four inmates have chosen lethal injection and two have died by bullets.\nA total of 39 men have been executed so far this year in the U.S., after an inmate was killed Friday by lethal injection in Arizona. At least five other executions are set in the U.S. during the rest of 2025.\nTaunts written in blood on the wall\nBryant admitted to killing Willard “TJ” Tietjen after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble.\nTietjen was shot several times. Candles were lit around his body. Someone took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child, dipped the corner in blood and wrote “victem 4 in 2 weeks. catch me if u can” on the wall, authorities said.\nTietjen’s daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn’t answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered.\nThe person on the other end told her she had the right number. Then she demanded to speak to her father.\n“And he said ‘you can’t, I killed him.’ And I said, ‘this isn’t funny, who are you?’ He said, ‘I’m the prowler. And I said, ‘excuse me, who are you?’ He said, ‘I’m the prowler,” Kimberly Dees testified before a judge who determined Bryant’s sentence.\nMore killings terrorize a South Carolina county\nProsecutors said Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of lonely, rural roads he shot them in the back.\nAs deputies frantically looked for the killer, many of the 100,000 people in Sumter County lived in fear over the random attacks. Officers stopped nearly everyone driving on dirt roads and told people to be leery of anyone they did not know asking for help.\nBryant used drugs to blunt pain from alleged sex abuse\nBryant’s lawyers said he was troubled in the months before the killing, begging a probation agent and his aunt to get him help because he couldn’t stop thinking about being sexually abused by four male relatives when he was a child.\n“He was very upset. He looked like he was being tortured. It’s like his soul was just laid wide open. In his eyes you could see he was hurting and suffering and he was living the abuse over again as it was coming out,” aunt Terry Caulder testified.\nBryant tried to help himself through the pain by using meth and smoking joints he sprayed with bug killer, his defense attorneys said.\nPrevious inmates executed have said methods are cruel\nThe six inmates executed in South Carolina since September 2024 have argued the state’s methods are cruel and unusual punishments, but have not been able to stop their deaths.\nWith the firing squad, attorneys for the inmates say the three volunteers with rifles nearly missed the heart of the second man killed, Mikal Mahdi. They suggested Mahdi was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly.\nCondemned inmates have also scrutinized the lethal injection procedures, which appear to now use two doses of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. They said inmates drown in a rush of fluid into their lungs but are paralyzed and cannot react.\nWitnesses to the four executions have not seen any signs of struggle and report the prisoners appear to have lost consciousness in about a minute.",

(AP) — Police in suburban Atlanta say they found the body of a six-month-old boy wrapped in a trash bag, dead from blunt force trauma to the head, after his father initially claimed the baby was kidnapped during an armed robbery.\nBoth the father and the mother were denied bail Friday and remained in jail after they were charged in the death of Nnakai Pratt.\nAntonio Pearce told Clayton County police on Sunday that Nnakai was snatched while sitting in his car seat by two armed men who also stole $6,500 in cash and 3 pounds (1.36 kilograms) of marijuana.\nThe kidnapping was alleged to have happened in an apartment that Pearce said he was using as a stash house in Riverdale, about 11 miles (18 kilometers) south of Atlanta. But late Tuesday, police found Nnakai’s body in the backyard of a house, just on the other side of a fence from the apartment complex.\nClayton County Detective Chieyenne Reynolds told reporters Friday that officers never believed Pearce’s story.\n“He was caught in a lot of lies throughout his interview process,” Reynolds said, saying witness statements and evidence from Pearce’s phone led police to the child’s body. Police also say Pearce asked another man to hide a backpack with guns and drugs.\nPolice haven’t said when or where Nnakai died or why Pearce might have killed him.\nPolice arrested Pearce on Sunday, charging him with marijuana possession and traffic offenses. They later added a false statements charge. Wednesday, they charged Pearce with Nnakai’s murder, concealing a death, tampering with evidence, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, cruelty to a child and falsely reporting a crime. They added a family violence charge on Thursday.\nPolice have also arrested Nnakai’s mother, Necolette Pratt, charging her with child cruelty, concealing a death, obstruction of an officer, false statements and being a party to a crime. A warrant for her arrest says she told investigators that Pearce had previously shaken the baby, local news outlets report. The warrant states investigators also found Pratt’s story inconsistent.\nNo lawyers are listed for Pearce or Pratt in court records.\nThe infant was a twin, and his surviving sister has been placed in the custody of child welfare authorities.\nMore details could come out next month during preliminary hearings for the parents.",

The district includes a tiny part of New York City and a swath of suburbs on Long Island.\nDec. 19, 2022: The New York Times publishes a story questioning whether Santos fictionalized his resume.\nDec. 26, 2022: Santos admits fabricating some details of his biography, including that he had a degree from Baruch College and had worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Despite calling himself “a proud American Jew” in a position paper, he insists he “never claimed to be Jewish” but rather “Jew-ish.”\nDec. 28, 2022: Nassau County prosecutors say they have launched an investigation into Santos.\nJanuary 2023: Santos is sworn into office. Questions surface about how he financed his campaign after filings offer contradictory accounts.\nJan. 31, 2023: Santos steps down from his congressional committees but says he won’t resign.\nFebruary 2023: Revelations surface that Santos had been charged with stealing puppies in Pennsylvania in 2017 by using bad checks. The case was dismissed after Santos said the checks came from a checkbook that had been stolen from him.\nMarch 2, 2023: The House Ethics Committee announces an investigation into Santos.\nMay 10, 2023: Santos is indicted and pleads not guilty to federal charges that he stole from donors and his campaign, collected unemployment benefits he didn’t deserve and lied to Congress about his wealth.\nOct. 10, 2023: A new indictment accuses Santos of stealing donors’ IDs and making unauthorized charges to their credit cards. Santos pleads not guilty to the revised charges later that month.\nNov. 16, 2023: The House Ethics Committee says in a scathing report on Santos that it amassed “overwhelming evidence” of lawbreaking, concluding flatly that he “cannot be trusted.”\nDec. 1, 2023: Santos is expelled by the House on a vote of 311-114, easily clearing the two-thirds majority required.\nDecember 2023: Not long after being expelled from the House, Santos is found to be offering the public personalized video messages for up to $200 on Cameo.\nFebruary 2024: Santos sues late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, alleging Kimmel deceived him into making Cameo videos that were used to ridicule Santos on the show.\nApril 23, 2024: Santos drops his longshot independent bid to return to Congress, a month after announcing his candidacy. His campaign committee reported raising no money in March 2024.\nAug. 19, 2024: Weeks before the case was to go to trial, Santos pleads guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, blaming his ambition for clouding his judgment and saying he was “flooded with deep regret.” The same day, a judge dismisses Santos’ lawsuit against Kimmel, saying the host’s use of the Cameo videos for criticism and commentary was a fair use.\nApril 25, 2025: Santos is sentenced in federal court to more than seven years in prison.\nJuly 25, 2025: Santos reports to the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, in southern New Jersey.\nOct. 17, 2025: President Donald Trump commutes Santos’ sentence.",

(AP) — New Mexico has its first Republican contender for governor ahead of the 2026 elections, as the three-term city mayor of fast-growing Rio Rancho launched his campaign.\nGregg Hull on Friday outlined priorities, including greater state investments in the health care workforce and roadways, in pursuing the Republican nomination ahead of an open race for governor. He also described a “zero-tolerance” approach to crime that would revisit the state’s bail reforms and seek changes to juvenile justice statutes.\n“I’ve taken a very pragmatic approach to solving problems up in Rio Rancho,” said Hull, a former business executive for a commercial crating company and a motorhome resale business. “That’s how we want to approach the issues in New Mexico.”\nThree Democratic candidates are pursuing their party’s nomination as Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham terms out of office next year.\nThey are former congresswoman and U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a tribal member of Laguna Pueblo; Albuquerque-based District Attorney Sam Bregman, the father of Major League Baseball star Alex Bregman of the Boston Red Sox; and former four-term Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima.\nNew Mexico lawmakers this month approved legislation to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump’s cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs, drawing on the state’s large surplus linked to booming local oil production.\nHull said he hopes to deploy the state’s outsized financial resources to expand vocational education, including training in construction trades, and shore up access to health care by underwriting medical school and other advanced degrees for health professionals — “but on the caveat that we need them to stay in the state and provide those services to New Mexicans.”\nOn public education, he emphasized a commitment to school choice but said it was too soon to say whether that might include public funding for private or parochial education options.\n“School choice means, really, parental oversight of their child’s education,” he said.\nHull sounded a supportive note on the current governor’s deployment of the National Guard in limited roles to shore up public safety in Albuquerque and the Española area.\n“When we look at public safety, we need to have all options on the table,” Hull said. “If these local governments need the help, then let’s help them.”\nNew Mexico has alternated between Democratic and Republican governors since the early 1980s.\nIn recent years, Democrats have consolidated control over ever statewide elected office in New Mexico, with majorities in the state House and Senate. Trump lost the presidential vote three times in New Mexico, but he gained ground in 2024.",

Meanwhile, he said, hundreds of other detainees are awaiting trials, which are scheduled to continue on Oct. 22.\nThe West African nation is set to go to the polls on Oct. 25. Elections in Ivory Coast have usually been fraught with tension and violence.\nThousands of Ivorians have been protesting against the exclusion of Tidjane Thiam, widely seen as the main challenger to President Alassane Ouattara.\nEarlier this year, a court ruled that Thiam was not eligible to run because he held French citizenship as at the time of registration, which is against Ivorian laws. Former president Laurent Gbagbo was also barred from contesting the election.\nThe protesters said the exclusions were intended to remove any obstacle to Ouattara’s fourth-term bid for the presidency.\n____\nAP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

He said that prosecutors sought bail of just under $1 million in the earlier case but that the judge set the amount at $200,000 — which King was able to pay.\nThat meant his accuser would have had to come to the courthouse and testify “knowing that the defendant will walk out the same door she came in.” That reality likely deterred her from testifying against King, he said, which resulted in the charges being dropped. Since Scott disappeared on Oct. 4, charges in the earlier case have been refiled.\nIn the Scott case, King’s bail has been set at $2.5 million and he remains in custody. Krasner urged any other women he has victimized to come forward now with their stories — promising that they will be kept safe.\nPolice have found a damaged car they believe King was driving at the time of Scott’s disappearance and other evidence linking him to the missing woman. Authorities also say King was the last person in contact with Scott, but Assistant District Attorney Ashley Toczylowski said Friday that investigators are no closer to locating her or determining what happened to her.\nKing has a preliminary hearing in the Scott case on Nov. 3. A message was left seeking comment for a lawyer listed as his defense attorney.",

(AP) — California ramped up its efforts to curb plastic pollution Friday — suing three plastic-bag makers, alleging the companies falsely claimed their products were recyclable.\nState Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said companies Novolex Holdings, Inteplast Group and Mettler Packaging violated a state law passed in 2014 that banned plastic bags at grocery store checkouts that weren’t recyclable.\nUnder the law, shoppers could pay 10 cents for thicker plastic bags that needed to be reusable and recyclable. But the makers of the bags labeled them as recyclable even though they were not — recycling facilities cannot process them and they end up dumped in landfills, incinerated, or in the state’s waterways, Bonta said.\n“In California, we’re making it clear,” he said at a news conference. “Truth matters. Public trust matters. Environmental protection matters.”\nThe companies did not respond to email and phone requests for comment.\nThe state filed a similar lawsuit against ExxonMobil about a year ago over the oil giant’s plastic products. The lawsuit said the company deceived the public by falsely promising that its plastic products would be recycled. The oil giant said California’s recycling system was ineffective and that the state should have worked with the company to keep plastics out of landfills.\nCalifornia lawmakers later decided the 2014 law didn’t go far enough. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law last year that will ban all plastic shopping bags at grocery stores starting next year.\nAt least a dozen states have some type of statewide plastic bag ban, according to the environmental advocacy group Environment America Research and Policy Center. Hundreds of cities also have their own bans.\nBonta announced Friday the state reached settlements with four other companies California alleged violated the 2014 law: Revolution Sustainable Solutions, Metro Poly, PreZero US Packaging and Advance Polybag. The businesses agreed to collectively pay the state nearly $1.8 million and halt plastic bag sales in California after selling the rest of their existing stock.\nThe lawsuit and settlements hold companies accountable for mislabeling their products as recyclable, said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for environmental group Californians Against Waste.\n“Plastic bags are a uniquely wasteful product,” he said in an email. “Nothing we use for minutes should pollute our environment for centuries, especially something so lightweight that it’s practically designed to become litter.”",

    "body": "From bills to berets: Notable moments from NYC’s contentious mayoral debate\nFrom bills to berets: Notable moments from NYC’s contentious mayoral debate\nNew York City’s mayoral candidates duked it out in their first general election debate Thursday night, with contenders Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa sparring over everything from the Israel-Hamas war to the city’s education system.\nIn addition to policy issues, the candidates also made revealing statements as they were asked about their weekly grocery bills and whether they had bought legal marijuana.\nHere are some of the notable moments:\nThe Middle East and religion\nMamdani, the Democratic nominee, wasted little time in trying to clean up comments he had made earlier in the week during an interview on Fox News, in which he sidestepped a question on whether Hamas should lay down its arms.\nIn the Fox interview, Mamdani said: “I don’t really have opinions about the future of Hamas and Israel, beyond the question of justice and safety and the fact that anything has to abide by international law.”\nOn Thursday, he was unambiguous. “Of course I believe that they should lay down their arms,” he said.\nCuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the Democratic primary and is running as an independent, has heavily courted the city’s Jewish voters during his campaign while characterizing Mamdani as unsympathetic to concerns about antisemitism.\n“Why wouldn’t he condemn Hamas?” Cuomo asked during the debate.\nAsked whether he thinks Mamdani is antisemitic, Cuomo said: “I don’t make those judgments about people. Are you a racist, are you an antisemite? I know there are many Jewish people who believe he is antisemitic.”\nMeanwhile, Cuomo was pressed on his relationship with the city’s Muslim community and his failure to visit mosques as governor.\nIn response, Cuomo said he doesn’t think Mamdani — who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor if elected — is “representative of the Muslim community.”\nMamdani countered: “It took Andrew Cuomo being beaten by a Muslim candidate in the Democratic primary for him to set foot in a mosque.”\nSliwa would like a word\nThose familiar with Sliwa might have noticed something missing Thursday night: The distinctive red beret that has sat atop the Republican candidate’s head since he created the Guardian Angels crime patrol group in the late 1970s.\nSliwa has ditched the hat at times during his campaign. But he went completely without it during the debate, at one point declaring that he “looks very mayoral tonight.” A small tan line could be seen running across his forehead, evidence of his dedication to the accessory.\nThe Republican, a longtime fixture of local radio and television, is a larger-than-life tabloid figure with a very New York gift of gab. He didn’t disappoint on Thursday.\nAsked how he gets around the city when he can’t take the subway, Sliwa said: “I try to avoid yellow cabs. As you know, I was shot in the back of a yellow cab in 1992 by the Gottis and the Gambinos.”\nBut he acknowledged that if he has to: “I Uber.”\nThroughout the debate, Sliwa — who was between Mamdani and Cuomo on the stage — sometimes found it hard to get a word in as his two opponents bickered.\n“I am being marginalized out of this,” Sliwa said.\nBut he also used his proximity to Cuomo to slip in frequent digs at the former governor.\nAfter Cuomo claimed that President Donald Trump would “back down” against him in disputes, Sliwa responded: “I know you think you’re the toughest guy alive, but let me tell you something: You lost your own primary, right? You were rejected by your Democrats. You have a difficult understanding what the term ‘no’ is.”\n“I agree with Curtis,” Mamdani chimed in.\nAndrew Cuomo blames TikTok\nDuring the Democratic primary, Cuomo avoided unscripted public events and his opponents and instead relied on his near-universal name recognition and a multimillion-dollar campaign fundraising apparatus.\nOn Thursday, Cuomo attributed his primary loss largely to his social media presence.\n“I think in the primary campaign I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now. I think the assemblyman did do a better job on TikTok and social media than I did during the campaign, and that has changed now,” said Cuomo, 67.\n“I’ve also increased my activity significantly, but my agenda is exactly the same,” he added.\nIn a follow-up question, a moderator asked if Cuomo learned any deeper lesson from the results of the primary and he responded: “Between the two campaigns, social media, more accessibility.”\nCost of living\nAsked how much they spend a week on groceries, the candidates all gave similar figures: Cuomo said $150, Sliwa $175 and Mamdani $125 to $150.\nBut asked about their monthly rent or mortgage payment, the costs showed a sharp contrast: Cuomo’s housing costs clocked in at $7,800, Sliwa $3,900 and Mamdani $2,300.\nBoth Cuomo and Sliwa noted that Mamdani’s home — a one-bedroom apartment in Queens that he shares with his wife — is one of the city’s many rent-stabilized apartments.\nCuomo argued as he has before that the state lawmaker’s apartment should be occupied by “a poor person” — though the units, which make up roughly 40% of the city’s rental stock, are currently open to people of all incomes.\nGot pot?\nNew York legalized recreational marijuana a few years ago, opening the door for legal pot shops across the state.\nThe candidates were asked if they have ever bought weed from one of the state’s dispensaries.\n“I have,” said Mamdani with a big smile across his face. ”I have purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop.”\nCuomo said he had not.\nWhile Sliwa responded: “When I was shot five times, I had Crohn’s disease, I did use medical marijuana, yes.”",

Veterinarian Susan Shaffer Sookram snipped the zip ties securing the lid and greeted the cargo: four dogs, one with a gray collar bearing its name, Happy.\n“What a scary ride!” she said. “You made it!”\nAs officials in Alaska work around the clock on one of the most significant airlift operations in state history — evacuating more than 1,000 people from remote, flood-battered villages on the coast of the Bering Sea — another rescue operation is playing out: getting the dogs left behind to safety, in hopes of later reuniting them with their owners.\nThe pet shelters closest to the devastated villages are in Bethel, a regional hub around 90 miles (150 kilometers) away by boat or plane.\nWhen Bethel Friends of Canines, a nonprofit that helps rehome animals, learned that 50 to 100 dogs might be abandoned in one of the villages, Kipnuk, it scrambled to charter a plane to evacuate them.\n“It costs us $3,000 to do this so and we don’t know how many times we’re gonna have to do it,” organizer Jesslyn Elliott said by phone Wednesday. “We’ve never had a natural disaster to this, like, magnitude. So this is all very, very foreign and new to us. So we’re just kind of winging it.”\nThe first flight arrived in Bethel on Wednesday night, and more happened Thursday. Dozens of dogs have passed through her kennel since the floods began. The nonprofit had raised more than $22,000 after pleading on Facebook for donations.\nThe flooding, caused by remnants of Typhoon Halong, has damaged homes in 11 small rural communities, with no more than a few hundred residents, according to FEMA. Many homes cannot be repaired until next summer as winter temperatures and snow are forecast for this month.\nState officials began airlifting people to Anchorage on Wednesday, as local leaders in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, near the Bering Sea, asked to evacuate residents and as shelters in Bethel neared capacity. At least one resident of Kwigillingok was confirmed dead, and the search for two others was called off after their how was swept away.\nPets were not allowed on the military evacuation flights. State officials have said that the evacuation of people is the priority.\nBethel Friends of Canines received dogs throughout the week as people fleeing their homes arrived by boat and by plane. There are no roads connecting towns in the area.\nMany of the pets owners want them back soon, but need time to prepare temporary lodgings in cities like Anchorage and Nome, which are more than 250 miles (400 kilometers) away.\nBefore the devastating floods, Bethel Friends of Canines typically held 15 to 20 dogs at any one time. Now as many as 15 dogs have arrived on a single flight. Elliott expects most of the additional dogs to stay in Bethel temporarily before being reunited with their owners or extended family that can foster them.\nAt least eight dogs had been reunited with owners in Anchorage as of Thursday morning, she said.\nHomes in affected villages are so damaged that they many not be livable in the winter, emergency management officials said Wednesday, and forecasters said rain and snow could arrive this weekend.\nWith the human population in Kipnuk shrinking each day, the animal caretakers in Bethel realized they had to act fast, before everyone who knew the dogs was gone.\n“There’s going to be nobody left there,” said Sookram, the veterinarian, in a phone interview. “We’re having to kind of accelerate how the animals are going to be leaving places only accessible by, at first, helicopter and now small planes,”\nSome of the last people to stay behind and serve the community are teachers. Schools in flooded towns have served as emergency shelters and meeting places through the relief effort.\nBack in Kipnuk, the dog with the gray collar, Happy, was found waiting on its owner’s clothes, refusing to move or eat, by teacher Jacqui Lang. She said in a text message that the dog has since been reunited with its family.\nShe’s one of two or three teachers who helped wrangle the pets to be loaded at the airstrip, according to Lower Kuskokwim School District Superintendent Andrew ‘Hannibal’ Anderson.\nWhen Bethel Friends of Canines worker Matthew Morgan landed in Kipnuk on Wednesday, the teachers had fed the dogs, coaxed them into crates and labeled them with tags listing their owners.\n“You’ve got some heroes out in Kipnuk. They’re like the last people left there,” Morgan said. Without them, “it would have been chasing dogs all night in the mud.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Jesse Bedayn in Denver contributed.",

    "body": "US and UN sanction former Haitian security head, gang leader for aiding gang coalition\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States and the United Nations slapped sanctions on the former head of Haitian presidential security and the leader of a Haitian gang on Friday for their roles in criminal gang activities that have destabilized the impoverished Caribbean nation.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said the two men supported a coalition of gangs that the Trump administration designated as a foreign terrorist organization earlier this year.\nThe U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution hours later ordering all 193 U.N. member nations to freeze the men’s assets and impose a travel ban. The resolution also imposes an arms embargo on Haiti.\nThe sanctions were placed on Dimitri Herard, who was head of presidential security when President Jovenal Moise was assassinated in 2021. He was imprisoned in connection with the assassination. After he escaped from prison in 2024, he “colluded” with Haiti’s most powerful gang coalition, Viv Ansanm, Treasury said in a statement.\nSanctions also were placed on Kempes Sanon, the head of the Bel Air gang, one of the many criminal groups that make up Viv Ansanm’s gang coalition. Besides helping the coalition consolidate power in Haiti, Treasury and the U.N. accused Sanon of extortion, kidnapping, illicit taxation and other human rights violations.\nGangs have grown in power since the assassination and now control 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. They have expanded their activities, including looting, kidnapping, sexual assaults and rape, into the countryside. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination.\nThe U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime has reported that increasingly sophisticated weapons are being trafficked into Haiti, mainly from the United States and especially from Florida, contributing to the worsening lawlessness.\nThe Security Council said Herard has been implicated in facilitating the trafficking of arms and ammunition. U.S. officials said he provided “training and firearms” to gang leaders, and “directly backs the Viv Ansanm’s coordinated attacks against State institutions.”\nThe U.N. resolution said Sanon had acted through his leadership of the Bel Air gang, which has approximately 150 members and operates from its stronghold in the capital’s Bel Air area.\n“Sanon also maintains a network of individuals within governmental institutions, including security agencies, which enables him to evade arrest and facilitate his criminal activities,” the resolution said. “He escaped from prison in 2021, where he was incarcerated for kidnapping, theft, and assassination, and has since continued to destabilize Haiti through his actions.”\nThe Treasury Department sanctions freeze any assets they have in the U.S. and block business transactions with the two men.\nBradley T. Smith, director of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, wrote in a statement: “Today’s action underscores the critical role of gang leaders and facilitators like Herard and Sanon, whose support enables Viv Ansanm’s campaign of violence, extortion, and terrorism in Haiti.”",

    "body": "FEMA staff sound the alarm on disaster preparedness at rally in front of agency headquarters\nCurrent and former staff of the Federal Emergency Management Agency demonstrated against workforce and program cuts during a “FEMA Solidarity Rally” on Friday, a potentially risky act of protest because some of the same staffers were placed on leave after signing a public dissent letter in August.\nSeveral dozen people gathered outside the FEMA headquarters in Washington, D.C., calling on President Donald Trump to stop dismantling the agency charged with managing the federal disaster response. They warned that eliminating FEMA, something the president suggested he would consider, would put lives at risk and hurt communities.\n“It’s clear these disasters are becoming more frequent and more intense,” Jeremy Edwards, the agency’s deputy director of public affairs under President Joe Biden, said at the rally. “Our country needs FEMA now more than ever. And right now, FEMA needs us, too.”\nThe demonstration also was a call to support FEMA staff members who have been on paid administrative leave for nearly two months after signing a public letter of dissent in August. That letter criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials for cutting staff and programs.\n“Try as they might to run us over, we are not backing down, and we are putting up one hell of a fight,” said Phoenix Gibson, one of the few current FEMA employees who publicly signed the dissent letter.\nFEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the rally.\nDemonstrators waved signs that said “FEMA Saves Lives” and “Hands off FEMA” while speakers paid tribute to FEMA’s staff and mission, which they said has been under attack by the Trump administration.\nFEMA veterans recalled proud moments when they helped deploy search and rescue teams after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, or helped nail tarps to people’s roofs after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nMichael Coen, FEMA chief of staff in the Obama and Biden administrations, said the employees’ commitment to helping people compelled them “to warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of the decisions being made by the current administration.”\nOrganizers said they want Noem to reinstate signers of the August declaration, for acting administrator David Richardson to resign and for FEMA staff to no longer be required to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of eliminating or phasing out FEMA, though that rhetoric has shifted in recent months. Noem often says FEMA should be eliminated “as it exists today” and remade into something new.\nThe agency has been in upheaval since January. About 18% of the agency’s permanent full-time employees have departed, including 24 senior-level staffers, according to the Government Accountability Office.\nThe administration also has slashed resilience and preparedness funding. A requirement that Noem personally approve any spending over $100,000 has drawn sharp criticism and was even blamed for delays in deploying search-and-rescue teams after the deadly Texas floods in July.\nTrump appointed a 12-person FEMA review council led by Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. It is expected to submit its recommendations around December.\nAny major changes to FEMA’s authority would require action by Congress. Lawmakers in the House introduced the bipartisan “FEMA Act” this summer, which calls for returning FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency, deploying project-based grants instead of reimbursements, and creating a single application for all federal disaster help for survivors, among other reforms.\nRally organizers said they supported the bill.",

Together, the charges carry a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\nRoberts, who is originally from Guyana and worked for two decades in school districts across the U.S., was detained Sept. 26 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a targeted operation that shocked the community.\nAuthorities said Roberts lacked authorization to work in the U.S. and fled from agents who conducted a traffic stop while he was driving his district-issued Jeep Cherokee. Roberts was later apprehended in a wooded area with help from the Iowa State Patrol. Authorities found a handgun wrapped in a towel inside his car, investigators said, along with $3,000 cash.\nDes Moines Public Schools hired Roberts in 2023 to lead its district of about 30,000 students. Days after being detained, Roberts resigned from his job, which included an annual salary of $286,716.\nThe indictment alleges that Roberts made a “false attestation” on a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, claiming he was a U.S. citizen when he knew he was not.\nRoberts’ attorney Alfredo Parrish said his client was not surprised by the indictment and would fight the charges at trial.\n“Dr. Roberts intends to enter a not guilty plea because he’s innocent of these charges,” he said. “Our immigration system, as most Americans understand, is in shambles.”\nThe district on Friday refused to release the I-9 form in response to a public records request filed by The Associated Press, saying it was a confidential personnel record under Iowa law and also part of the federal investigation. District officials have said Roberts also submitted a driver’s license and Social Security card as part of the verification process.\nAuthorities have said Roberts came to the U.S. in the 1990s and his work authorization expired in 2020. An immigration judge issued a final order for his removal last year after a hearing where Roberts failed to appear, and Roberts’ request to reopen the proceedings was rejected earlier this year. Roberts’ attorney has argued his client was led to believe by a former attorney that the appeal had been resolved in his favor.\nAfter his detention by ICE, Roberts was transferred to U.S. Marshals custody Oct. 2 to face a federal firearms charge. Roberts, 54, remains at the Polk County Jail in Des Moines.\nIn addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, three other firearms were found during a search of Roberts’ home, authorities said. The indictment describes the four weapons, including two pistols, a rifle and a shotgun.\nThe firearms charge carries a punishment of up to 15 years in prison, while the false statement charge carries up to five years.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has publicized a lengthy criminal history for Roberts, including a 2020 arrest in New York state on a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, details of which have been sealed. He was cited in 2021 for a minor firearms violation in Pennsylvania related to his storage of a hunting rifle in his vehicle.\nThe fallout from the case has been widespread. The district filed a lawsuit alleging the consulting firm it used during the 2023 superintendent search failed to adequately vet Roberts’ background. The firm has defended its work, which included flagging a discrepancy involving a doctorate degree falsely claimed by Roberts on one resume.\nState Auditor Rob Sand announced this week that his office will investigate the district’s finances in response to an outside request. The move came after the AP reported that Roberts had pushed to award district business to a firm that employed him as a consultant, despite the conflict of interest.\nSchool Board Chair Jackie Norris ended her campaign for U.S. Senate on Thursday, citing the need to lead the district through the crisis. The district is asking voters to approve a $265 million bond referendum next month that would raise property taxes in order to support program and building improvements.\n___\nFoley reported from Iowa City, Iowa.",

    "body": "Montana State Prison pipe leaks create crisis and prompt broad water system overhaul\nNearly a week after leaks cut off water for about 1,500 inmates at the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge, inmate Bryce Baltezar said things at the facility are dystopian.\n“As soon as you hit the door, it smells like (urine) smacking you right in the face,” Baltezar said in a phone interview with Montana Free Press on Tuesday. The smell of human waste, he continued, has become the new normal.\nBaltezar said he’s concerned about sanitation and safety for the roughly 90% of the prison’s population affected by the leak. Montana State Prison houses male inmates and had a population of 1,597 as of Wednesday.\nWater supply issues at the prison started at 6 a.m. on Oct. 10. The Department of Corrections has since identified several leaks, ultimately prompting a broad water infrastructure overhaul. The department has not clarified what caused the leaks, but spokesperson Carolynn Stocker said the department “has experienced numerous service interruptions at its various facilities related to extreme weather, failing infrastructure, and more, but none have risen to this level of emergency.”\nIn a press release Wednesday, Stocker said the prison’s water and sewer system was built in the 1970s and that “work on the system has for the most part been limited to fixing problems, not maintaining or improving the system for the long haul.”\nStocker said that the corrections department will start installing a new water system using $21 million from House Bill 5, a state facilities-focused infrastructure bill passed during the legislative session that concluded in April.\n“Years of deferred maintenance have caught up with us, and we’re finding multiple failures throughout the system. We will continue providing water to our inmates while we take on this longer fix,” Department of Corrections Director Brian Gootkin said in the press release. He has instructed teams working on new units at the prison to begin the water system work as early as next week.\n“We are going to simultaneously continue our work to identify the issues with the existing system and install a modern system that will take us into the future,” Gootkin said. “This is not going to be an easy couple of months for inmates or staff, but the end result will be worth it.”\nWhile work is ongoing, water will be temporarily unavailable in some prison units throughout the day, the release stated. There are 153 portable toilets, 13 that are ADA-compliant, and 43 portable showers at the prison, according to a Tuesday statement from Stocker. It took until the end of Wednesday for all inmates to get a chance to shower since the leaks started. Inmates receive a rationed number of water bottles daily for drinking and hygiene.\nWithout operational plumbing across 10 buildings, temporary facilities are in short supply, creating tension between guards and inmates, Baltezar said. He said that he has been scrutinized and sometimes berated by correctional officers while using portable toilets, and that he has “never felt so dehumanized in my whole life.”\n“I literally just came into my cell and called my wife crying,” Baltezar said.\nThe department has enlisted a range of groups to aid the situation. About a dozen employees from other branches of the agency have arrived at the facility to assist with security. The Montana National Guard has helped manage the water supply and deploy temporary showers. Water detection firms supported corrections in locating leaks around the premises.\nStocker said the agency was unable to offer an estimate of the incident’s total cost.\n___\nThis story was originally published by Montana Free Press and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

I didn’t do none of this!” he screamed. “What witness? What fingerprints? I didn’t do this!”\nThe assaults occurred between July 1995 and February 1997, with the attacker entering the residences through a window, prosecutors said. The victims ranged in age from 21 to 42 — including one woman who was assaulted on two separate occasions. Each victim was also robbed of money and valuables.\nBenjamin was linked to the assaults by DNA obtained last year from a discarded cup he had used inside the Rockdale County Sheriff’s office, prosecutors said. It was submitted for testing and matched DNA retrieved at the time the assaults occurred.\nBenjamin was arrested in Georgia on Sept. 22 and extradited to New York on Tuesday. He faces 17 counts, including sexual assault and burglary charges.\n“Although decades have passed, these cold cases were not forgotten,” Queens County District Attorney Melinda Katz said. “It is never too late for justice.”\nBenjamin’s lawyer, Joseph Amsel, said his client “vigorously, vehemently and vociferously” denies the charges. “Most of these charges are outside of the statute of limitations,” Amsel said.",

    "body": "Portuguese parliament approves bill banning face coverings in public\nMADRID (AP) — Portugal ‘s parliament on Friday approved a bill banning face veils worn for “gender or religious” reasons in public, in a move seen as targeting the face coverings worn by some Muslim women.\nThe measure was proposed by the far-right Chega party and would prohibit coverings such as burqas — a full-body garment that covers a woman from head to foot — and niqabs — the full-face Islamic veil with space around the eyes — from being worn in most public places. Face veils would still be allowed in airplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship.\nThe bill stipulates fines for those wearing face veils in public ranging between 200 euros and 4,000 euros ($234 and $4,669).\nPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa still has to approve the bill. He could veto it or send it to the Constitutional Court for review.\nIf signed into law, Portugal would join a number of European countries such as Austria, France, Belgium and the Netherlands who have full or partial bans on face and head coverings.\nNot many women in Portugal wear such coverings, but the issue of Islamic veils has generated controversy similar to other European countries.\nChega cited France and other European Union countries’ rationales for banning face coverings commonly worn by Muslim women. The far-right Portuguese party received support for the bill from center-right parties.\nIn its bill, Chega said that hiding the face subjects individuals — especially women — “to situations of exclusion and inferiority” and was incompatible with principles such as “liberty, equality and human dignity.”\nLawmakers from left-leaning parties disagreed.\n“This initiative is used solely to target foreigners, those who have a different faith,” said center-left Socialist Party lawmaker Pedro Delgado Alves whose party voted against the bill.\nHe said that while no woman should be forced to wear a veil, the far-right party’s approach was wrong.",

    "body": "University of Nebraska now spends more on administrators and managers than on faculty\nAt first glance, they look like raises.\nAt the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, a music professor’s salary jumped $13,000 in the past decade. A University of Nebraska at Kearney political science professor’s grew by $15,000. A University of Nebraska at Omaha social work professor got a $19,000 bump.\nBut then you factor in inflation, and the financial reality becomes clear: All three actually took serious pay cuts. When adjusted, the music professor suffered a pay slash of 16%.\nIt’s part of a profound shift in how the University of Nebraska makes money, spends money — and who it spends money on.\nIn 2000, NU paid its administrators and professional staff $155 million. This year, a quarter century later, that number has more than tripled to $484 million.\nAt the same time, pay to faculty has grown, but at a much slower rate that doesn’t match inflation.\nIn 2024, for the first time this century, the state’s public university system spent more on administrators, managers and professional staff than it did on faculty members who teach students, advise students and do research on its five campuses.\n“… (I)f we keep devaluing the academic side of what we do at the university, then you’re going to get less performance,” said John Shrader, president of the faculty senate at UNL. “And that’s not what I think the governor, the Legislature and the Board of Regents want. This is a manifestation of the lack of investment.”\nEarlier this year, a less-than-asked-for state appropriation led to NU calling for $20 million in cuts. At UNL, students and faculty have weathered $75 million in cuts in five years, with another $27.5 million on the way.\nThe current cuts on the table include eliminating and merging academic programs and cutting 58 full-time positions and $10.25 million. The proposed cuts would also include $17.25 million in administrative cuts, voluntary professor buyouts and other budget cuts. The NU Board of Regents will vote on the proposed cuts in December.\nThe spike in administrative and managerial spending reflects the increasing scope and complexity of college, university officials and higher education experts told the Flatwater Free Press — things like parking, increased housing options, student life, building operations. Many of these areas are actually moneymakers for NU, as it and universities around the country hunt for new revenue sources while federal and state funding shrinks.\nBut that spike is especially stark when compared with how much the University of Nebraska pays its professors and instructors.\nWhen adjusted for inflation, the cost of faculty across the system declined by 10% in the past 10 years, while administrative and professional costs grew by 54%.\nAt UNL, faculty spending has gone down by 23% in 10 years when adjusted for inflation. The University of Nebraska Medical Center is the only individual campus that has grown inflation-adjusted faculty spending since 2015.\nUniversity leaders are quick to distinguish the different funding streams that pay for professors from the way administrators and managers are paid at NU headquarters at Varner Hall and on the university’s five campuses.\nYes, administrative spending has grown, they say, but most of that money is pulled from revenue generated by those departments. For example, much of the money made by student housing goes back into keeping that department running.\nThe bulk of faculty and academic spending draws from the state-aided budget, a mix of taxpayer money and tuition dollars that can generally be used however university leaders see fit. Half of that state-aided budget goes to pay for professors and instructors, according to the university budget.\n“It is the people in the administration who create the federal contracts, who create research contracts, who create corporate contracts, who work with the foundation to get the philanthropic support,” said Jeffrey Gold, president of the NU System. “We don’t want to pull faculty out of the classroom or the research lab to worry about an upcoming higher education learning commission survey, or College of Medicine accreditation survey or anything of that nature.”\n(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)\nThe University of Nebraska’s evolution can also be seen through whom it employs.\nIn 2010, the number of faculty on NU campuses, just under 4,000, was essentially identical to the number of employees classified as “administrative” or “professional.”\nThis year, there are 4,725 faculty.\nThere are 5,462 administrative and professional employees. The university has added roughly 1,400 of those positions in the past 15 years.\nThe increase in roles outside of the classroom is a national trend, said Robert Kelchen, a professor specializing in higher education finance at the University of Tennessee.\nIt’s happening in part because higher education has become more complicated as a business, he says. It’s also happening because students are wanting and needing more things from college than they did in the past.\n“There’s the housing, the parking services, the student unions — there’s all those aspects of a campus,” said Anne Barnes, senior vice president and chief financial officer for the NU System. “They’re kind of like little individual businesses. They’re expected to break even, they’re expected to meet consumer demands.”\nUNO added dorms in the early 2000s, meaning it needed to hire administrators in housing, Barnes said.\nThe UNL Athletic Department has added professional and managerial staff to oversee name, image and likeness activity, commonly known as NIL, in this new era of college sports.\nNU has grown its student mental health services, hired administrators who commercialize and monetize the intellectual property stemming from university research and added staff to oversee research compliance.\nThat all has led to an increase of $329 million spent on administrative roles in 25 years. Adjusted for inflation, administrative spending grew at a rate outpacing faculty spending at every campus except for UNMC.\nIn that same quarter century, the University of Nebraska at Kearney saw an 11%, inflation-adjusted drop in its faculty budget.\n“The idea that all this (administrative) spending has been disproportionately going upwards … it’s disgusting, it’s unfortunate,” said William Aviles, a professor at UNK and president of the faculty union. “It so markedly illustrates that (national) trend in terms of spending and where the resources are being accumulated. That context really puts our small raises into perspective.”\n(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)\nNU’s revenue is split into two main parts: There’s the unrestricted state-aided budget — a mix of tuition dollars and state appropriations that fund most of the university’s faculty and academics.\n“It’s the state-aided budget that gives us the flexibility to make decisions,” Gold said. “It’s pretty much the only flexible pool.”\nAnd there’s the designated and restricted budget which, as it sounds, has limits on how that money can be spent.\n“If we get a contract from the Department of Defense to work on a computer program for them, we can’t use that to buy light bulbs and floor wax for the College of Journalism,” Gold said.\nIt’s those restricted and designated funds that largely cover the administrative costs that have ballooned in the past quarter century, Barnes said.\nMost of the money that pays for faculty comes from the state-aided budget.\n“When we look at just the state-aided funds, that support for faculty and administration has remained very constant,” Barnes said. “With the other funds … that’s where it might look a little bit odd in comparison to growth in the spending on faculty salaries.”\nNU’s faculty spending from just the state-aided budget did double in 25 years. But at the same time, administrative and professional spending in that same state-aided budget skyrocketed by 158%.\nThere’s nothing stopping universities from rerouting surplus money from things like housing and athletics into academics, but it’s rarely a meaningful amount, Kelchen said. And it wouldn’t be a reliable flow of money year to year, meaning the university would still need to address its structural deficit, Barnes said.\nCuts to administrative and managerial jobs would mean cutting into the revenue those jobs bring in, Barnes said. And cutting to a point of inefficiency would make it hard to do things like process the research contracts and federal grants that have become a large chunk of university revenue, Gold said.\n“I’m not saying we’re there, but we’re getting precariously close to being there,” Gold said. “We get asked all the time, ‘Why can’t you just cut more?’ Well, if we can’t process these requests, that will hurt us even more.”\n___\nThis story was originally published by Flatwater Free Press and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

    "body": "Where will fans find NBA games on TVs or streaming devices this season? The league has an answer\nMichael Jordan is back in the NBA with NBC, and that network brought the sounds of “Roundball Rock” back as well. Amazon Prime is entering the league after hiring many broadcasters who were with Turner Sports in recent years. ESPN acquired “Inside the NBA,” the most popular studio show in league history.\nA new NBA season starts Tuesday. A new 11-year, $76 billion TV deal kicks in along with it. And that means changes, including — and perhaps most importantly — fans having to figure out which games are where on what days.\n“Like the other partners, we’ll be happy to promote the full schedule of NBA and make people aware of where to find the great NBA product across the other two partners, Amazon and ESPN,” NBC Sports executive producer Sam Flood said. “So, we’re ready to work as one to make that happen.”\nWith some slight deviation along the way, a good rule of thumb for how the national television schedule in the NBA will go this season looks like this: Peacock on Mondays, NBC and Peacock on Tuesdays, ESPN on Wednesdays and Prime Video on Fridays. Starting around the midseason point, there will be more Prime Video offerings on Thursdays, with Saturdays being shared by ABC, ESPN and Prime Video. Sundays will see a combination of ABC, ESPN and NBC/Peacock.\nThere will be some innovations, such as some games having an analyst seated near the team bench and not with the person calling play-by-play, as is typically the case. The NBA’s app will also now offer scores in as close to real time as possible, with the graphic elements there including a live clock — all done with virtually no latency.\n“It was one of the discussions we had with our media partners, not just the cost of the games — and I think most people are conditioned to paying a certain amount for high-value content — but also the discovery of those games,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month. “Again, I’m a fan of many different sports. I think we’ve all had that experience where you’re going to Google to find the game you want to watch because the world has changed it’s not just automatically in the place you thought it would be.”\nThe league said Friday it has come up with a way to help the what-game-is-where issue, with the launch of a digital initiative it calls “Tap to Watch.” It will direct fans — seamlessly, the league hopes — to “live NBA games from league, team and a range of popular third-party digital platforms, including all national games on ABC/ESPN, NBC/Peacock, and Prime Video, as well as nearly all local games.”\nThe opening night doubleheader — Houston at Oklahoma City in ring night for the champion Thunder, followed by Golden State at the Los Angeles Lakers — will be on Peacock and NBC, the first NBA regular-season games on that network in more than 20 years.\nJordan, the six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls, will be “a special contributor” for NBC and it seems likely that he’ll be part of opening night in some way.\n“Stay tuned Tuesday night,” Flood said.\nESPN and ABC will keep the league’s top package, which includes the NBA Finals. ABC has carried the finals since 2003.\nESPN/ABC will air nearly 100 regular-season games, as will NBC — including on Sunday nights once the NFL season has ended. Prime Video will have exclusive global coverage of 66 regular-season NBA games, plus all knockout-round games in the NBA Cup and rights to the entirety of the play-in tournament.\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

This week, Hamas released the 20 remaining living hostages after the two sides agreed to a tenuous ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.\nAl-Muhtadi was an operative of the Gaza-based military wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, according to the complaint prepared by FBI Supervisory Special Agent Alexandria M. Thoman O’Donnell and submitted to a federal judge on Oct. 6. O’Donnell serves on a task force investigating the murder and kidnapping of American citizens during the attack two years ago.\nOn his U.S. visa application, Al-Muhtadi denied he had ever been involved in terrorist activities, and became a legal permanent resident in 2024, the complaint says.\nThe complaint says he could face charges for visa fraud and for conspiring to provide support for a foreign terrorist organization. Al-Muhtadi was arrested Thursday, according to the Justice Department.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said that the Justice Department remains “dedicated to finding and prosecuting those responsible for that horrific day, including the murder of dozens of American citizens.”\n“We will continue to stand by Jewish Americans and Jewish people around the world against anti-Semitism and terrorism in all its forms,” Bondi said.\nInmate records show someone with Al-Muhtadi’s same name and age is being held at St. Martin Parish Correctional Center, near Lafayette. He was scheduled to appear in federal court Friday morning.\nNo attorney was identified for Al-Muhtadi in court filings. The FBI declined to provide more details to The Associated Press, citing the government shutdown.\n“Justice will be served,” Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said in an X post. He added that Al-Muhtadi might be sent to the newly opened immigration detention wing of the state’s maximum security prison, known as “Louisiana Lockup”: “Perhaps this is Louisiana Lockup’s newest resident?”\nAl-Muhtadi’s social media and email accounts revealed a yearslong affiliation with a Hamas-aligned paramilitary group, including carrying out firearms training, according to the FBI.\nOn the morning of Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas forces attacked Israel, the then-military commander of Hamas, Mohammed Deif, called for “the masses” to join in.\nAl-Muhtadi told his associates to “get ready” and “bring the rifles,” and that “there is kidnapping, and it’s a game, which will be a good one,” according to phone calls reviewed by the FBI. He also asked an associate to bring ammunition.\nThe FBI says Al-Muhtadi coordinated an armed group to travel into Israel and that during the attack his phone pinged a cell tower near Kfar Aza, an Israeli village where dozens of residents were killed and approximately 19 kidnapped.\nIn June 2024, Al-Muhtadi submitted an electronic U.S. visa application in Cairo. In the application, he denied serving in any paramilitary organization or having ever engaged in terrorist activities. His application said he intended to live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and work in “car repairs or food services.” He entered the U.S. in September 2024.\nAl-Muhtadi lived in Tulsa through May but by early June had relocated to Lafayette, where he worked for a local restaurant, the FBI says.\nAn unidentified FBI agent repeatedly met with Al-Muhtadi in Lafayette from July to September this year.\nAn associate advised Al-Muhtadi not to contact anyone from the paramilitary group because he was under surveillance in the U.S. and to avoid posting on social media in support of Hamas. The FBI says Al-Muhtadi responded that he could post whatever he wanted, including pictures of Hamas leaders, and he would be safe.\n___\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Some sang songs about the KLA and freedom.\nThe protest was organized by the veterans’ association known as OVL-UCK, and supported by Albania’s government and prime minister, under the motto: “Freedom has a name. Justice for the liberators.”\nKosovo’s former President Hashim Thaci, former Parliament speakers Kadri Veseli and Jakup Krasniqi, and ex-lawmaker Rexhep Selimi are on trial and have been in custody since 2020 at the EU-backed Kosovo Specialist Chambers court based in The Hague, Netherlands. They face charges that include murder, torture and persecution of civilians during and after the war.\nA big poster with their photos and bearing the slogan “Heroes of war and peace” hung from the podium.\n“Albanians do not trust the Specialist Chambers. Processes at The Hague are biased and unfair,” said Hysni Gucati, head of the OVL-UCK.\nAlfred Moisiu, 95, Albania’s former president, was also present and called for justice, saying the defendants “have been detained without evidence, on fabricated charges.”\nThe rally was peaceful.\nThe court and an associated prosecutor’s office were created after a 2011 report by the Council of Europe, a human rights body, that included allegations that KLA fighters trafficked human organs taken from prisoners and killed Serbs and fellow ethnic Albanians. The organ harvesting allegations haven’t been included in indictments issued by the court.\nTwo other former KLA members have already been sentenced by the court. Gucati and another KLA official were also convicted by the court of witness intimidation and obstructing justice.\nSome 11,400 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, died during the war, before a NATO bombing campaign forced Serbia to pull its troops out of Kosovo and to cede control of its former province to the United Nations and NATO.\nKosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which was recognized by the United States and most of the West, but not by Serbia or its allies Russia and China. Tensions between Kosovo and Serbia remain high.",

(AP) — Barack Obama has endorsed the Democratic candidates for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, seeking to boost Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ahead of high-stakes elections next month.\nThe two-term Democratic former president appears in digital ads for the candidates, who are running in the only governors races this year. The odd-year contests are seen as a barometer of how voters feel about President Donald Trump and Republicans who control Congress ahead of the 2026 midterms.\nSherrill faces Republican former Assembly member Jack Ciattarelli, who has been endorsed by Trump. The president participated in a telephone town hall for Ciattarelli ahead of his GOP primary win, and is expected to hold a tele-town hall for him again before the Nov. 4 election.\nSpanberger is up against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced Trump but has not been endorsed by him. Spanberger is a former CIA case officer and served three terms in Congress, ending this year.\nObama specifically mentions the stakes in the video backing Spanberger, criticizing Republicans over tax cuts for the wealthy and for taking aim at abortion rights. He describes Virginia’s elections as “some of the most important in the country this year.”\nThe ad backing Sherrill in New Jersey mentions her background as a mom, Navy pilot and one-time federal prosecutor, a biographical sketch that’s been front and center throughout the campaign.\nObama’s endorsements come as Democrats have struggled with fundraising and intraparty debates since Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump last year. The party is eager to notch victories in the two Democratic-leaning states that Obama won twice, especially after Trump’s national victory last year. With voting already underway in both states, Democrats are eager to capitalize on anything that might get their voters to the polls.\nWhile Democrats have a registration edge in New Jersey and the state has been firmly Democratic in presidential and Senate contests, it has seesawed between the parties in races for governor. And Trump performed better in New Jersey last year than he did in 2016 or 2020.\nSherrill is seeking to succeed term-limited incumbent Phil Murphy, a fellow Democrat who defeated Ciattarelli in a closer-than-expected 2021 contest.\nIn Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is also term limited. Peyton Vogel, press secretary for Earle-Sears’ campaign, called the Obama endorsement “a desperate play” and said Spanberger is “leaning on liberal elites” to try to save her campaign.\nA Spanberger campaign spokesperson said she is grateful to have Obama’s endorsement.\nMail ballots are already being turned in in New Jersey, which also has early in-person voting beginning next week. Early in-person voting is already underway in Virginia where people can also vote by absentee ballot.",

    "body": "Gold prices topped $4,300 this week. What’s driving the surge?\nNEW YORK (AP) — As economic uncertainty deepens, the rush for gold continues — with prices for the precious metal topping $4,300 for the first time this week.\nThe going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.\nGold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a “safe haven” for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad — with President Donald Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable. Still, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.\nHow much have gold prices climbed this year? What about silver?\nGold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 — trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That’s up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.\nSilver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.\nWhy are prices going up?\nA lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.\nMuch of this year’s economic turmoil has spanned from Trump’s trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike — pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market. As a result, hiring has plunged while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.\nThe U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed — and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.\nSeparately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point — and projected it would do so twice more this year.\nInvestments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there’s been strong gold demand from central banks around the world — particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\nAnd on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency — with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.\nWhat about jewelry?\nMany jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own — sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal’s rising price.\nAt the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling “sticker shock” if they can’t afford certain products anymore — particularly if it’s something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.\nLarger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.\nIs gold worth the investment?\nAdvocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven — arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.\nStill, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn’t always the inflation hedge many claim — and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up — meaning “when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,” the commission noted.\nGold demand escalates mercury poisoning warnings\nThe frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences — with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.\nMercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people’s bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks — putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.\nThe Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world.",

    "body": "Israel receives remains of 2 more hostages as military says another body was not that of a hostage\nIsrael receives remains of 2 more hostages as military says another body was not that of a hostage\nJERUSALEM (AP) — Israel received the remains of two more hostages Wednesday, hours after the Israeli military said that one of the bodies previously turned over was not that of a hostage. The confusion added to tensions over the fragile truce that has paused the two-year war.\nThe coffins carrying the remains were transferred by the Red Cross from Hamas. Upon returning to Israel, they were sent to a forensic lab in Tel Aviv. The military in a statement cautioned that the hostages’ identities had yet to be verified.\nMeanwhile, the Gaza Health Ministry said it received 45 more bodies of Palestinians from Israel, another step in implementation of the ceasefire agreement. That brought to 90 the total number of bodies returned to Gaza for burial. The forensics team examining the remains said they showed signs of mistreatment.\nAs part of the deal, four bodies of hostages were handed over by Hamas on Tuesday, following four on Monday that were returned hours after the last 20 living hostages were released from Gaza. In all, Israel has been awaiting the return of the bodies of 28 hostages.\nThe Israeli military said forensic testing showed that “the fourth body handed over to Israel by Hamas does not match any of the hostages.” There was no immediate word on whose body it was.\nIn exchange for the release of the hostages, Israel freed around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees Monday.\nUnidentified bodies returned to Gaza show signs of abuse\nIsrael is expected to turn over more bodies, though officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned. It is unclear whether the remains belong to Palestinians who died in Israeli custody or were taken from Gaza by Israeli troops. Throughout the war, Israel’s military has exhumed bodies as part of its search for the remains of hostages.\nAs forensic teams examined the first remains returned, the Health Ministry on Wednesday released images of 32 unidentified bodies to help families recognize missing relatives.\nMany appeared decomposed or burned. Some were missing limbs or teeth, while others were coated in sand and dust. Health officials have said Israeli restrictions on allowing DNA testing equipment into Gaza have often forced morgues to rely on physical features and clothing for identification.\nThe forensics team that received the bodies said some arrived still shackled or bearing signs of physical abuse.\nSameh Hamad, a member of a commission tasked with receiving the bodies at Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital, said some arrived with their hands and legs cuffed.\n“There are signs of torture and executions,” he told The Associated Press.\nThe bodies, he said, belonged to men ages 25 to 70. Most had bands on their necks, including one that had a rope around the neck.\nMost of the bodies wore civilian clothing, but some were in uniforms, suggesting they were militants.\nHamad said the Red Cross provided names for only three of the dead, leaving many families uncertain of their relatives’ fate. The fighting has killed nearly 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in Gaza. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\nThousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.\nRasmiya Qudeih, 52, waited outside Nasser Hospital, hoping her son would be among the 45 bodies transferred Wednesday from Israel.\nHe vanished on Oct. 7, 2023, the day of the Hamas-led attack that triggered the war. She was told he was killed by an Israeli strike.\n“God willing, he will be with the bodies,” she said.\nNetanyahu says Israel won’t compromise\nThe ceasefire plan introduced by U.S. President Donald Trump had called for all hostages — living and dead — to be handed over by a deadline that expired Monday. But under the deal, if that didn’t happen, Hamas was to share information about deceased hostages and try to hand them over as soon as possible.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel “will not compromise” and demanded that Hamas fulfill the requirements laid out in the ceasefire deal about the return of hostages’ bodies.\nTrump, in an interview with CNN, warned that Israel could resume the war if he feels Hamas isn’t upholding its end of the agreement.\n“Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word,” Trump said.\nHamas’ armed wing said in a statement Wednesday that the group honored the ceasefire’s terms and handed over the remains of the hostages it had access to.\nHamas has assured the U.S. through intermediaries that it is working to return dead hostages, according to two senior U.S. advisers. The advisers, who were not authorized to comment publicly and briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said they do not believe Hamas has violated the deal.\nThe widespread destruction in the territory has complicated the retrieval of the dead, the officials added. One of the advisers said debris as well as unexploded weapons add to the difficulty.\nHamas has told mediators that some bodies are in areas controlled by Israeli troops.\nThis is not the first time Hamas has returned a wrong body to Israel. During a previous ceasefire, the group said it handed over the bodies of Shiri Bibas and her two sons, who were among those taken in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted.\nTesting in February 2025 showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Bibas’ body was returned a day later.\nMore aid bound for Gaza\nThe World Food Program said its trucks began arriving in Gaza after the entrance of humanitarian aid into Gaza was paused for two days due to the exchange on Monday and a Jewish holiday Tuesday.\nThe timing of the scaled-up deliveries — which are part of the ceasefire deal — was called into question after Israel said Tuesday that it would cut the number of trucks allowed into Gaza, saying Hamas was too slow to return the hostages’ bodies.\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent said 400 trucks carrying food, fuel and medical supplies were bound for Gaza on Wednesday. The Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza, COGAT, declined to comment on the number of trucks expected to enter Gaza.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo and Shurafa from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip.

    "body": "The Latest: Israel identifies remains of 2 more hostages\nThe Latest: Israel identifies remains of 2 more hostages\nIsrael’s National Institute of Forensic Medicine on Thursday identified the remains of two more hostages returned from Gaza, as officials and families warned Hamas to hand over the bodies of those still held.\nAmid a fragile truce that paused the two-year war, Palestinians were awaiting a long-promised surge of aid into Gaza, and plans for an international force to deploy there were beginning to take shape.\nSince Monday’s exchange, Hamas has returned 10 bodies, nine of which Israel’s military has identified as hostages. Israel said there were 28 total in Gaza before the exchange.\nIn exchange for the release of the hostages, Israel freed around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees Monday.\nHere’s the latest:\nSoldier from Israel’s Bedouin community laid to rest in southern desert\nMuhammad Al-Atarash, 39, a member of Israel’s Bedouin community, brother to 22 siblings and father of 13, served as a tracker in the northern brigade of the Israeli military’s Gaza Division. His funeral was held amongst baren desert hills outside Sa’wa, a Bedouin town near the southern Israeli city of Be’er Sheva.\nAl-Atrash was killed fighting Hamas militants in the area of Nahal Oz on October 7, 2023, his body taken into Gaza that day. In a recorded interview with Ynet, his brother Salem said that after eight months of initially not knowing his brother’s fate, Israeli officials revealed “horrific” footage of his brother to him. The IDF announced Al-Atrash’s death in June, 2024.\nSoldiers in fatigues paced behind family members in jeans and black shirts carrying his casket draped with an Israeli flag in the desert sun.\n“For the first eight months we held onto hope that Muhammad, who fought valiantly, would return to the embrace of his family,” said Gaza Division commander, Brig. Gen. Barak Hiram standing before the burial mound adorned with wreaths. Confirming his death “pierced our hearts,” he said.\nThroughout the over twenty years of his service, Al-Atrash “set an outstanding example for all those around him,” he said. He described Al-Atrash as having a special love for the land, and served “in his life and death as a true bridge for mutual responsibility and shared living for all the children of Abraham and lovers of life in this good land.”\nThree deceased Israeli hostages were laid to rest in separate ceremonies\nThe bodies of Staff Sgt. Tamir Nimrodi, Sgt. Maj. Muhammad al-Atrash and Eitan Levy were handed over by Hamas earlier this week under a ceasefire agreement.\nNimrodi, 18, was abducted by Hamas militants during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel. The Israeli military confirmed that he was likely killed in an Israeli airstrike targeting senior Hamas officers two days after his abduction.\nUntil his identity was confirmed this week at the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine, Nimrodi had been the last remaining hostage not officially declared dead.\n“A day ago, I received the news that shattered my heart,” his mother Herut said in her eulogy. “How am I supposed to say goodbye to my first-born son? My only son?”\nThousands of people lined the streets from Nimrodi’s home in Nirit where the funeral procession began and joined the ceremony at the Kfar Saba military cemetery where he was laid to rest beneath a large canopy surrounded by rows of soldiers and civilians.\nClad in a cap and wearing sunglasses, Nimrodi’s father Alon broke down in sobs as he recalled how they reached “every corner of the Earth” to speak about the “amazing, moral, extraordinary young man you are.”\n“I am sorry. I am sorry I couldn’t bring you home alive. Forgive me, my beloved first-born. Forgive me.”\nDoctors, family members are struggling to identify bodies\nHealth officials in the Gaza Strip are struggling to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel under the Gaza ceasefire.\nHealth authorities in the blockaded territory say they do not have access to DNA testing or other advanced technology that Israel has used to identify the remains of hostages taken in Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.\nOn Thursday, workers at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis unloaded dozens of white body bags. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has helped facilitate the exchange of bodies, said 120 bodies have been returned to Gaza in the last three days, citing local hospital officials.\nDr. Mohammed Zaqout, the head of Gaza’s hospitals, said they have only been able to identify four bodies so far. He said some of the bodies appear to have had their wrists tightly bound, indicating those individuals may have died in Israeli custody.\nSome may have died in battle or in Israeli strikes.\nThe Israeli military says it acts in accordance with local and international law and “completely rejects allegations regarding the systematic abuse of detainees.”\nBoth Israel and Palestinian militants hold the bodies of their adversaries in order to exchange them in deals like the one currently being implemented.\nPalestinian Health Ministry says a boy has died from injury after shooting\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank says an 11-year-old boy has died from injuries as Israeli soldiers opened fire toward stone-throwing youths south of Hebron.\nThe ministry, citing local residents, said Mohammad Bahjat Al-Hallaq died from a bullet wound in the pelvis after soldiers opened fire toward youths who threw stones at military vehicles passing through the town of Al-Rihiya in the southern West Bank.\nThe Israel military, contacted by The Associated Press, said it was looking into the matter.\nThe United Nations has reported that at least 18 children under the age of 15 have been killed by Israeli gunfire in the occupied West Bank this year, marking the third consecutive year child fatalities in the territory have reached the double digits.\nUN and its partners step up delivery of meals, bread, diapers and medicine in Gaza\nU.N.-supported bakeries produced over 100,000 bread bundles weighing 2 kilograms on Tuesday, and 21 U.N. partner agencies distributed nearly 960,000 meals, the U.N. spokesman said.\nStephane Dujarric told U.N. reporters in New York on Thursday that the U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, also distributed more than one million diapers for babies. And he said the U.N. World Health Organization sent three truckloads of surgical and medical supplies from its warehouse in central Deir al Balah to the central pharmacy in Gaza City for transfer to Shifa Hospital, which will help 10,000 people.\nDujarric said between Friday and Tuesday, U.N. teams collected nearly 3,500 metric tons of supplies from the Kissufim and Kerem Shalom crossings from Israel to Gaza. On Tuesday, he said, the U.N. and its partners sent wheat flour, food parcels, nutrition supplements, date bars, food supplies for kitchens, hygiene kits, sanitary pads, diapers, various medical equipment, tents and animal fodder to those crossings.\nIn response to questions, Dujarric called reports that numerous remains of Palestinians sent to Gaza from Israel showed clear signs of torture “extremely concerning,” and stressed again that there must be accountability for all violations of international law during the two-year war.\nDujarric also said the U.N. continues to call for the release of the former director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, Husam Abu Safiyyah, whose detention was just extended by Israel for six months,\nIsrael carries out a series of airstrikes in southern Lebanon\nThe airstrikes targeted a cement plant and quarry and a site belonging to an environmental group it accused of being affiliated with Hezbollah.\nThe Israeli army said in a statement that Hezbollah was using the quarry “with the aim of rebuilding terrorist facilities and infrastructure.” A few days earlier, Israel had struck several lots storing bulldozers and excavators, also claiming that the equipment was intended for use by Hezbollah.\nThe Israeli military said the environmental group it targeted, Green Without Borders, “was used by Hezbollah to conceal terrorist activities aimed at rebuilding the organization’s infrastructure.”\nLebanon’s health ministry said six people were injured in strikes in the towns of Bnaafoul and Ansar. The strikes sparked massive explosions that could be seen and heard in areas far from the targeted site, “causing tremors that sparked panic and tension among citizens,” the state-run National News Agency reported.\nIsrael’s foreign minister says the Rafah crossing into Gaza will ‘probably’ reopen\nIsrael’s foreign minister said this may happen Sunday, as hopes rise for an influx of aid and access to the territory under a ceasefire agreement.\nGideon Sa’ar made the comments to reporters after a meeting with European and other officials at the Med Dialogues meeting in Naples, Italy, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.\n“We are making all the necessary preparations. It is also coordinated with the EUBAM force of the European Union and, as far as I know, also with the Palestinians themselves,” Sa’ar said, referring to a unit of EU monitors at Rafah. “So it will probably be opened this Sunday. I hope it will be open and everything possible will be done to make it so.”\nThe crossing, which connects Gaza and Egypt, in the past has been an important entry point for food, medicine and other supplies that are desperately needed by Gaza’s roughly 2.3 million people.\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense ministry that oversees humanitarian aid in Gaza, said Thursday that humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. It said humanitarian aid continues to enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing and others after Israeli security inspections.\nUN clears more aid with Israeli officials\nDespite hurdles and delays in getting aid into Gaza, UN officials said Thursday that they have used this time to clear even more aid with Israeli officials to prepare for when crossings reopen.\nStephane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesperson, said that a total of 200,000 metric tons of aid have been approved for entry into Gaza when officials receive the green light to continue their work,\nMeanwhile, Dujarric said that the aid that was able to make it into Gaza on Sunday is being quickly distributed to Palestinians by various U.N, agencies, including more than a million diapers.\nGaza Health Ministry says it has received bodies of 30 unidentified Palestinians from Israel\nThursday’s development brings the total of bodies of Palestinians handed over by Israel since the ceasefire deal to 120.\nThe remains have been transferred over the last three days, wrapped in body bags and numbered, none of them identified. They were handed over through the Red Cross as part of the exchange for human remains of hostages, the international organization said.\nIt was not immediately known if they were Palestinians who died in Israeli prisons or whose bodies were taken from Gaza by Israeli troops. The Health Ministry in Gaza posted pictures of nearly half of the returned bodies so far, asking families to come forth if they recognize any of their relatives. Some of the bodies were badly decomposed, missing limbs or teeth, and doctors said some of the returned bodies showed signs of abuse.\nIsraeli court extends detention of Gaza hospital director\nAn Israeli court has extended the detention of Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, a well-known hospital director from Gaza, his family and an Israeli rights group involved in his defense said Thursday.\nAbu Safiya led Kamel Adwan Hospital through an 85-day siege last year and documented the ordeal on social media, becoming the face of the struggle to keep treating patients under Israeli siege and bombardment.\nHe has been held without charge by Israel for nearly ten months since his December 2024 arrest. Israeli authorities said he was placed under investigation on suspicion of cooperating with Hamas — an accusation his staff and international aid groups that worked with him denied.\nOn Thursday, the Palestinian human rights organization Al Mezan, Abu Safiya’s family and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel said they had been notified that he would not be released, despite earlier indications that he might be among the hundreds of Palestinians detained without charge who returned to Gaza as part of this week’s exchange.\nPhysicians for Human Rights-Israel noted 17 other Palestinian doctors were detained in Israel without charge.\n“Their continued detention serves no real justice — it only harms the right to health of the Palestinian people.”\nThere was no comment from Israeli authorities.\nHamas official defends killings of alleged gang members\nA Hamas political official has defended the execution- style killings of alleged gang members carried out by Hamas forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect.\n“The people who were targeted caused death and corruption in Gaza and killed displaced persons and aid seekers, and more dangerous than that, they represented the origin and foundation of Israel’s Zionist project,” Hamas political representative in Lebanon Ahmed Abdul Hadi said regarding the men who were publicly killed.\n“This was done by a Palestinian national and tribal consensus,” he said.\nAbdul Hadi also claimed that Israel had made last-minute changes to a list of Palestinian prisoners to be released to remove high-profile figures such as Marwan Barghouti.\n“We asked for much more than this and put all the key leaders on the list, which was approved by the Zionist delegation in Cairo,” he said. “When it went to the (Israeli) government, to be approved, they removed the first 25 names.”\nChief of staff in Yemen Houthi rebel’s military dies from wounds suffered in Israeli airstrike\nAn Israeli airstrike targeting top leaders in Yemen’s Houthi rebels in August killed the chief of staff of its military, officials said Thursday, further escalating the tensions between the group and Israel even as a ceasefire holds in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Houthis first acknowledged the killing of Maj. Gen. Muhammad Abdul Karim al-Ghamari, who had been sanctioned by the United Nations over his role in the country’s decadelong war.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz a short time later claimed the killing, saying that al-Ghamari had died of wounds he suffered in the attack and had joined “his fellow members of the axis of evil in the depths of hell.”\nPalestinian prime minister stresses says ‘Palestinian national ownership’ should be central to rebuilding\nInternational efforts to map Gaza’s future — including Trump’s 20 point plan — have largely deferred a return to power by the Palestinian Authority, which is led by rivals of Hamas, until it carries out major reforms.\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said Thursday in Ramallah that the Palestinian Authority’s plan would build directly on an Arab-led initiative announced in March. He stressed that rebuilding should be “anchored in Palestinian national ownership and leadership.” Israeli and U.S. officials rejected that plan at the time.\nThough he did not mention them directly, Mustafa’s remarks stood in contrast to proposals that would place Gaza under an internationally supervised transitional governance led by a technocratic, apolitical committee.\nThe Ramallah-based authority hasn’t controlled Gaza since Hamas seized power in 2007 and is mistrusted by both Israel’s right-wing government and many Palestinians.\nMustafa said the PA’s program aims to rebuild Gaza and better connect it with the occupied West Bank, which it currently administers. He said the plan includes restoring an estimated $67 billion in damage.\n“Recovery will not only restore homes, schools, hospitals and infrastructure,” Mustafa said. “Hopefully it will also restore hope for our people, strengthen governance, empower communities and build resilience against future shocks.”\nEU says it is committed to Gaza reconstruction\nPraising the ceasefire in Gaza, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union is committed to stability and reconstruction in the war-ravaged coastal enclave.\n“It is a very special moment for the Mediterranean, but also for Europe,” Von der Leyen said in Brussels. “As both share a common future of peace and cooperation, often during unimaginable pain and loss, the devastating war in Gaza has now come to an end, marking a pivotal moment not only for Gaza, but also for the European Union and the wider Mediterranean.”\nThe 27-nation bloc is the largest single donor to the Palestinian Authority and has pledged to help flood Gaza with aid and bring in a police support program from the West Bank to assist in stabilization.\nKaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the bloc has launched a new donor platform to finance reconstruction in Gaza. She said that for “peace to be sustainable in Gaza, it needs strong international backing, which also means European Union.”\nIsraeli officials identify remains of 2 more hostages\nIsrael’s National Institute of Forensic Medicine on Thursday identified the remains of two hostages returned from Gaza, as officials warned Hamas to hand over the rest.\nThe Israeli military said the bodies were those of Nova music festivalgoer Inbar Hayman and Sgt. Muhammad al-Atresh, who were killed in fighting on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, igniting the war.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel remained “determined, committed, and working tirelessly to bring back all our fallen hostages for proper burial in their homeland.”\nHamas and the Red Cross have said that recovering the remains was a challenge because of Gaza’s vast destruction, and Hamas has told mediators that some bodies are in areas controlled by Israeli troops.\nUN humanitarian chief visits key crossing route\nThe United Nations’ humanitarian chief is visiting a key Israel-controlled crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip on Thursday, as aid groups seek to ramp up deliveries of food and other basic necessities to ease hunger, disease and collapsing sanitation.\n“This route is a vital lifeline for food, medicine, tents and other lifesaving aid. We want to see it full of trucks, as part of a massive surge of aid following the peace deal,” U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher wrote on X.\nA day earlier, Fletcher warned that hopes pinned on last week’s ceasefire could fade amid what he called “setbacks” to getting aid into Gaza, while the World Food Program said the situation remained unpredictable. Fletcher urged Hamas to return the bodies of deceased hostages and called on Israel to allow the promised aid surge to move forward, as outlined in the agreement.\nTurkey appoints special envoy to coordinate Gaza aid\nTurkey has appointed a special envoy to coordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza and ensure the rapid delivery of aid, Turkish Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday.\nAmbassador Mehmet Gulluoglu was named Coordinator for Humanitarian Aid to Palestine, and was already on the ground in Gaza, the officials said. He and his team will assess urgent needs, coordinate with U.N. agencies, support their operations, and consult with authorities in Egypt and Jordan to manage logistics. The envoy will also work to strengthen medical support and oversee the evacuation of patients in need, said the officials who requested anonymity to discuss the issue.\nSeparately, Turkey’s emergency response authority, AFAD, has made preparations to deploy an 81-person search and rescue team to assist in the recovery of missing bodies and the removal of debris, according to reports from Turkey’s IHA news agency and other media. Turkish officials would not confirm the reports.\nTurkey has delivered 102,000 tons of aid to Gaza by sea and air since the start of the conflict in October 2023.\nFollowing the ceasefire, an additional 865-ton shipment was sent by sea on Oct. 14, Turkish officials have said.\n- By Suzan Frazer\nIsrael receives remains of 2 more hostages\nIsrael received the remains of two more hostages Wednesday, the Red Cross said.\nThe remains were transferred by the Red Cross from Hamas. After the two coffins arrived in Israel, the military in a statement cautioned that the hostages’ identities had yet to be verified.\n“Israeli health and forensic authorities are responsible for identifying the remains of the deceased,” the ICRC said in a statement verifying it facilitated the transfer.\n“The parties must endeavor to facilitate the return of the remains of the deceased to their families. The ICRC can fulfil its functions as a neutral intermediary only through the cooperation of all actors, and within the framework of the current agreement,” it said.",

    "body": "Chief of staff of Yemen Houthi rebel’s military dies from wounds suffered in Israeli airstrike\nChief of staff of Yemen Houthi rebel’s military dies from wounds suffered in Israeli airstrike\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An Israeli airstrike targeting the top leaders of Yemen’s Houthi rebels in August killed the chief of staff of its military, officials said Thursday, further escalating tensions between the group and Israel even as a ceasefire holds in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Houthis have acknowledged the killing of Maj. Gen. Muhammad Abdul Karim al-Ghamari, who had been sanctioned by the United Nations over his role in the country’s decadelong war.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said al-Ghamari died of wounds he suffered in the attack and had joined “his fellow members of the axis of evil in the depths of hell.”\nKatz referred to the strike as “the strike of the firstborn,” likely a reference to a series of strikes Israel conducted on Aug. 28. That attack killed Houthi Prime Minister Ahmed al-Rahawi and others. However, analysts suggested al-Ghamari may have been wounded in a different attack targeting the secretive group.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also acknowledged Israel killing al-Ghamari.\n“Another chief of staff in the line of terror chiefs who aimed to harm us was eliminated,” Netanyahu said. “We will reach all of them.”\nHouthis offer few details\nIn a statement carried by the Houthi-controlled SABA news agency, the militants said al-Ghamari had been killed alongside his 13-year-old son Hussain and “several of his companions.” It did not elaborate on the date of the strike, nor did it identify the others killed in the strike.\n“His pure soul ascended while he was in the course of his jihadi work,” SABA said.\nThe United Nations, in sanctioning al-Ghamari, described him as playing “the leading role in orchestrating the Houthis’ military efforts that are directly threatening the peace, security and stability of Yemen, as well as cross-border attacks against Saudi Arabia.”\nThe U.S. Treasury also said al-Ghamari was “responsible for orchestrating attacks by Houthi forces impacting Yemeni civilians” in sanctioning him in 2021. It described him as having received training from Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n“As the head of the general staff of the Houthi armed forces, the most senior commander within the Houthi military leadership structure, al-Ghamari is directly responsible for overseeing Houthi military operations that have destroyed civilian infrastructure and Yemen’s neighbors,” specifically Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the Treasury said at the time.\nThe Israel military described al-Ghamari as being “responsible for hundreds of missiles and (drone) attacks launched toward Israeli civilians and the state of Israel.”\nAl-Ghamari also led a Houthi offensive targeting Yemen’s energy-rich Marib province.\nThe Treasury listed his year of birth as either 1979 or 1984 at the time of his sanctioning. His other survivors weren’t immediately known.\nAnother SABA statement said al-Ghamari would be replaced by Maj. Gen. Yusuf Hassan al-Madani. He had been sanctioned at the same time as al-Ghamari by the U.S. over his work as “a prominent Houthi military leader” who commanded the rebels’ fifth military zone, including the key Red Sea port city of Hodeida.\nDeath comes as Gaza ceasefire takes hold\nIt remains unclear how the Houthis will respond. The group gained international prominence during the Israel-Hamas war over its attacks, which it said were aimed at forcing Israel to stop fighting. Since the ceasefire began Oct. 10, there has not been a Houthi attack targeting either Israel or shipping.\nThe Houthi campaign against shipping has killed at least nine mariners and seen four ships sunk. It upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war. The rebels’ most recent attack hit the Dutch-flagged cargo ship Minervagracht on Sept. 29, killing one crew member on board and wounding another.\nThe Houthis meanwhile have increasingly threatened Saudi Arabia and taken dozens of workers at U.N. agencies and other aid groups as prisoners, alleging without evidence they were spies — something fiercely denied by the world body and others.\n“Among the most dangerous espionage cells that became active are those affiliated with organizations working in the humanitarian field, notably the World Food Program and UNICEF,” claimed the Houthi’s secretive leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, in a televised speech Thursday without offering evidence.\nU.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric forcefully rejected al-Houthi’s remarks.\n“The accusations are extremely disturbing,” he said. “They’re extremely worrying coming from the leadership. And accusations, calling U.N. staff spies or, as we’ve seen in other contexts, calling them terrorists — all that does is it puts the lives of U.N. staff everywhere at risk, and it’s unacceptable.”\n___\nAssociated Press writer Zvi Smith in Tel Aviv, Israel, contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A look at the hostages whose remains are still inside Gaza\nA look at the hostages whose remains are still inside Gaza\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Hamas freed the last 20 living hostages taken during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has returned the remains of nine hostages, but the process of returning the bodies of the last 19, as called for in the ceasefire agreement, has stalled.\nHamas says it hasn’t been able to reach all of the remains because they are buried under rubble left behind by Israel’s two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel has accused the militants of dragging their feet and threatened to resume military operations if all of the remains aren’t returned.\nHere’s a look at the hostages whose remains haven’t been returned.\nTamir Adar, 38\nTamir Adar was a farmer and third-generation member of kibbutz Nir Oz. He loved hiking and spending time in nature with his kids. Adar was a member of the kibbutz’s emergency first responder team and left his family in their home’s safe room to help defend the community when Hamas attacked.\nIn the last message he sent to his wife before he was killed in the attack, he wrote: “You don’t open for anyone, even if it’s me asking you to open.”\nAdar’s grandmother, Yaffa Adar, 85, was kidnapped on Oct. 7, with militants driving her into Gaza on a golf cart, before being released in a ceasefire weeks later. Adar is survived by his wife and two children.\nSahar Baruch, 25\nSahar Baruch, from Kibbutz Be’eri, loved science, Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering and fantasy books. He competed in chess competitions and was set to begin an electrical engineering degree when he was abducted. He previously served in the military as a mechanic. He and his brother, Idan, were at their mother’s house on Oct. 7. Idan was killed in the attack.\nThree months into Sahar’s captivity, the Israeli military said he was killed during an attempted rescue mission. He is survived by his parents and two other siblings.\nItay Chen, 19\nItay Chen was an Israeli American who was abducted along with two other members of his tank battalion, Daniel Peretz, who also died, and Matan Angrest, who survived and was released from captivity on Monday. Chen loved basketball and studying human biology, according the Hostages Families Forum.\nOriginally from Netanya, in central Israel, Chen was killed on Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. His father, Ruby Chen, has met frequently with American leaders about getting all of the hostages returned to Israel, including the remains of the dead. Itay Chen is survived by his parents, two brothers, and a dog named Gucci.\nAmiram Cooper, 84\nAmiram Cooper was one of the founders of kibbutz Nir Oz, an economist and the author of three poetry books, according to the Hostages Families Forum. Cooper was abducted alive on Oct. 7 from Nir Oz along with his wife, Nurit, who was released after 17 days. Cooper was featured in a Hamas video, filmed under duress, with two other elderly hostages. In June 2024, Israel confirmed that Amiram had been killed. He leaves behind Nurit, three children and nine grandchildren.\nOz Daniel, 19\nOz Daniel was an Israeli soldier who was killed on Oct. 7. His body was taken from his tank along with three others. He was a gifted guitarist who started playing at age 9. He practiced long hours even during his army service and dreamed of being a professional musician. His favorite band was Guns N’ Roses, according to the Hostages Families Forum. He is survived by his parents and twin sister.\nRonen Engel, 54\nRonen Engel was born and raised in Tel Aviv but moved to kibbutz Nir Oz in 2010. He volunteered as a paramedic with Magen David Adom and crisscrossed Israel on his motorcycle. He was a talented photographer and loved renovating old junk. On Oct. 7, Engel was killed while attempting to protect his family. His wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a ceasefire the following month.\nMeny Godard, 73\nMeny Godard was a professional soccer player before enlisting in the Israeli military and serving in the 1973 Mideast War, according to Kibbutz Be’eri. He served in a variety of different positions in the kibbutz, including at its printing press.\nOn the morning of Oct. 7, Godard and his wife, Ayelet, were forced out of their home after it was set on fire. She hid in the bushes for a number of hours before militants discovered her and killed her. She was able to tell her children that Meny had been killed before she died. The family held a double funeral for the couple. They are survived by four children and six grandchildren.\nHadar Goldin, 23\nHadar Goldin’s remains are the only ones that have been held in Gaza since before the war. The Israeli soldier was killed on Aug. 1, 2014, two hours after a ceasefire took effect ending the that year’s war between Israel and Hamas. Based on evidence found in the tunnel where Goldin’s body was taken, including a blood-soaked shirt and prayer fringes, the military quickly determined that he had been killed in the attack.\nGoldin is survived by his parents and three siblings, including a twin. He had proposed to his fiancée before he was killed. Earlier this year, Goldin’s family marked 4,000 days since his body was taken. The military retrieved the body of another soldier who was killed in the 2014 war earlier this year.\nRan Gvili, 24\nRan Gvili, who served in an elite police unit, was recovering from a broken shoulder he sustained in a motorcycle accident but rushed to assist fellow officers on Oct. 7. After helping people escape from the Nova music festival, he was killed fighting at another location and his body was taken to Gaza. The military confirmed his death four months later. He is survived by his parents and a sister.\nTal Haimi, 42\nTal Haimi, a fourth-generation resident of Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak, was a mechanical engineer, a camping enthusiast and a member of the emergency response team. He was killed on Oct. 7 while battling militants at the kibbutz’s entrance. He is survived by his father, his wife, Ela, and four children. His youngest child was born seven months after the attack.\nAssaf Hamami, 41\nCol. Assaf Hamami had been the commander of the Israeli military’s Southern Brigade since 2022. According to Israeli media, Hamami was the first person in the military to declare that Israel was at war, at 6:37 a.m. on Oct. 7, less than 10 minutes after the attack began. Hamami and two of his soldiers were killed and their bodies were taken to Gaza. The other two soldiers’ remains were retrieved in July 2024. Hamami is survived by his wife and three children.\nEliyahu Margalit, 76\nEliyahu Margalit managed the cattle farm and horse stables at kibbutz Nir Oz for many years and was a “cowboy at heart,” according to the Hostages Families Forum. Margalit was abducted from the stable as he was feeding the horses on the morning of Oct. 7. His daughter, Nili Margalit, was abducted and released during a November 2023 ceasefire.\nJoshua Loitu Mollel, 21\nJoshua Mollel was a Tanzanian agricultural student who arrived at kibbutz Nahal Oz only 19 days before Oct. 7.

    "body": "Egypt raises fuel prices for the second time this year\nCAIRO (AP) — Egypt increased fuel prices by around 12% on Friday, a step likely to drive up the costs of goods and services across the country. This is the second fuel price hike this year.\nIn a statement posted on Facebook, the Egyptian government gave no reason for the move but said fuel prices will remain fixed in the local market with no further increases for at least one year.\nEgyptians have been grappling with soaring inflation as they navigate rising daily costs that reached another high last year. They included an increase in fuel prices, a hike in subway fares and a slide in the Egyptian pound against foreign currencies.\nAccording to the latest data from the Central Bank of Egypt posted Oct. 8, Egypt’s annual urban consumer price inflation reached 11.7% in September— down from 12% in August and 13.9% in July.\nFuel prices last increased in April, rising between 11% and 14% on various fuel products.\nAt the time of a previous price hike in late 2024, the government said that raising prices was meant to “reduce the gap between the selling prices of petroleum products and their high production and import costs.”\nAccording to the new prices taking effect on Friday, the cost of a liter of diesel — which is heavily relied on for public transport — increased from 15.50 pounds ($0.33) to 17.50 pounds ($0.37), while the price of the 92-octane gasoline rose to 19.25 pounds ($0.40) from 17.25 pounds ($0.36) and the 95-octane gasoline increased from 19 pounds ($0.40) to 21 pounds ($0.44).\nThe petroleum sector will continue running refineries at full capacity and provide incentives to its partners to boost production, reduce import expenses, and stabilize costs — with the aim of narrowing the gap between production costs and selling prices, said the government on Friday.\nEarlier this year, the government raised the minimum monthly wage for both public and private sector workers to 7,000 pounds ($138), up from 6,000 pounds ($118.58).\nThe Egyptian economy has been hit hard by years of government austerity, the coronavirus pandemic, the fallout from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and most recently, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthi attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea have slashed Suez Canal revenues, which is a major source for foreign currency. The attacks forced traffic away from the canal and around the tip of Africa.\nEgypt previously reached a deal with the IMF to more than double the size of its bailout to $8 billion. The price hikes have been deemed necessary to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for further assistance to the country.\nIn March, the IMF said it completed its fourth review of Egypt’s economic reform program approving a $1.2 billion disbursement for the North African country.",

    "body": "Syrian Kurdish forces reach agreement with Damascus to merge with national army, commander says\nSyrian Kurdish forces reach agreement with Damascus to merge with national army, commander says\nHASSAKEH, Syria (AP) — The Syrian government and the main Kurdish-led force in the country’s northeast have agreed in principle on a plan to merge the U.S.-backed force as a cohesive group into the national army, Syria’s main Kurdish commander said Thursday.\nThe comments by Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press appeared to signal a breakthrough after talks between the SDF and the central government in Damascus had floundered for months.\nIn December, insurgent groups led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, marched into the capital Damascus removing President Bashar Assad from power and forcing him to flee to Russia. The attack marked the end of a five-decade rule by the Assad family, who belong to the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.\nThe new Sunni-led leadership in Damascus under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, the former leader of HTS, inked a deal in March with the SDF, which controls much of the country’s northeast.\nUnder the agreement, the SDF was to merge its forces with the new Syrian army, but details were left vague and implementation has stalled.\nA major sticking point had been whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or whether the force would be dissolved and its members individually absorbed into the new military.\nAgreement on a mechanism\nAbdi said the two sides have now agreed on a “mechanism” for the merger.\n“We are talking about a large number, tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as thousands of internal security forces,” Abdi said. “These forces cannot join the Syrian army individually, like other small factions. Rather, they will join as large military formations formed according to the rules of the Defense Ministry.”\nHe added that they have formed a committee that will work with the defense minister and other military officials to specify the “suitable mechanisms.”\nAbdi said that he expects SDF members and commanders who will join the national military will receive good posts at the Defense Ministry and army command.\nOver more than a decade, the SDF gained military experience as it spearheaded the fight against the Islamic State group that once controlled large parts of Iraq and Syria. The SDF, with the help of the U.S.-led coalition, captured the last sliver of land in east Syria from IS in March 2019.\n“Based on their experience and long service they will get a respectable place within the Syrian army,” Abdi said. He added that their experience “will help in strengthening the military.”\nThe police force in northeast Syria will also merge into the country’s security forces, he said.\nAbdi said that during a trip earlier this month to Damascus he met with al-Sharaa and other officials including the ministers of foreign affairs and defense, during which they reached “an agreement in principle” on the mechanism of merging the SDF into the army.\nThose meetings came amid rising tensions. Damascus organized parliamentary elections earlier this month in which the SDF-controlled areas did not take part. Also earlier this month, clashes broke out between security forces and Kurdish fighters in neighborhoods of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo.\nA path toward resolving tensions\nAbdi said that implementation of the agreement between Damascus and the Kurdish forces could also help in solving many other problems in the country coming out of a 14-year civil war that left nearly half a million people dead.\nAbdi said in the interview with the AP that sectarian killings by pro-government gunmen and security forces in Syria’s coastal region in March and in the southern province of Sweida in July raised fears among many residents in northeast Syria, making them hesitant to implemented the agreement.\nThis “was one of the reasons that contributed to the delay in implementing the March 10 agreement,” he said. “However, we believe that if progress is made in the March agreement and all its provisions are practically implemented, we will be able to prevent the recurrence of such events.”\nThe Kurdish commander said that in order for such sectarian attacks to be prevented in the future, an agreement should be reached in which all Syrians have equal rights and will participate in building the state.\nAbdi said the SDF is advocating for a decentralized form of government “with powers distributed between the center and the provinces” within a united state. The central government in Damascus has been fearful that decentralization would lead to de facto partition of the country.\nAbdi added that implementing the March agreement will mean that all civilian, economic and military institutions in northeast Syria will merge into the Damascus-based authority.\nQuestions remain regarding whether neighboring Turkey will accept the merger of the SDF into the Syrian army as a cohesive unit rather than its dissolution.\nAnkara regards the SDF as a terrorist group because of its ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.\nAbdi struck a hopeful tone.\n“I believe that if we Syrians agree — as is happening now — Turkey will have no excuse to interfere inside Syria,” he said, adding that “we have noticed some flexibility in the Turkish position regarding the SDF’s accession to the Syrian army.”",

    "body": "Hannibal Gadhafi, son of late Libyan leader, ordered released in Lebanon if he pays $11 million bail\nBEIRUT (AP) — A Lebanese judge on Friday ordered the release of the son of Libya’s late leader Moammar Gadhafi on condition that he pay $11 million bail.\nHannibal Gadhafi has been imprisoned in Lebanon for a decade without being charged.\nThe expected release comes after his lawyers have said that he had been ill in his cell at police headquarters in Beirut. Libya in 2023 formally requested his release, citing his deteriorating health after he went on hunger strike to protest his detention without trial.\nOn Friday, judicial officials said he was taken to the Justice Palace in Beirut, where Judge Zaher Hamadeh questioned him and later ordered his release once the money is paid. Another condition for his release, however, is that he be banned from traveling outside Lebanon for two months.\nAfter the session was over, Gadhafi was taken back to the cell.\nJudicial officials in Beirut said Gadhafi’s defense team has filed a case against the Lebanese state in Geneva over holding him without trial, adding that the case is expected to be discussed in Switzerland next month.\nOne of Gadhafi’s lawyers, Charbel Milad al-Khoury, told The Associated Press that Gadhafi does not have the money and does not have access to accounts in order to pay the bail. Al-Khoury added that Hannibal Gadhafi’s defense team plan to lodge an appeal on Monday over the $11 million bail and ask that it be abolished.\n“This decision is almost impossible to be met,” al-Khoury said about the bail. “Hannibal has been held for 10 years and it is not logical to release him for $11 million bail.”\nGadhafi has been detained in Lebanon since 2015 after he was abducted by Lebanese militants demanding information on the whereabouts of a prominent Lebanese Shiite cleric. Lebanese police later announced it had picked up Gadhafi from the city of Baalbek, in northeastern Lebanon, where he was being held. He has since been held in a Beirut jail.\nGadhafi had been living in exile in Syria with his Lebanese wife, Aline Skaf, and children until he was abducted and brought to Lebanon.\nHe has faced questioning over the past years over the 1978 disappearance of Shiite cleric, Moussa al-Sadr, during a visit to Libya.\nThe case has been a long-standing sore point in Lebanon. The cleric’s family believes he may still be alive in a Libyan prison, though most Lebanese presume he is dead. He would be 96 years old.\nAl-Sadr was the founder of a Shiite political and military group that took part in the long Lebanese civil war that began in 1975, largely pitting Muslims against Christians.\nAsked on Friday, about al-Sadr, Gadhafi responded “I Don’t know” and “I don’t remember,” according to four judicial officials who attended the session. They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\nMoammar Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters during Libya’s 2011 uprising-turned-civil war, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.\nHannibal Gadhafi, who was born nearly three years before al-Sadr disappeared, fled to Algeria after his father was toppled and Tripoli fell to opposition fighters, along with his mother and several other relatives. He later moved to Syria where he was given political asylum and stayed there until he was abducted.\nMoammar Gadhafi had eight children from two marriages. Most of them had significant roles in his government. His son Muatassim was killed at the same time as Gadhafi Snr was captured and slain. Two other sons, Seif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed in the uprising.\nSeif al-Islam, the one-time heir apparent to his father, has been in Libya since his release from detention there in 2017. Gadhafi’s son Mohammed and daughter Aisha live in Oman. Al-Saadi, a former soccer player, was released from prison in Libya in 2021 after being jailed following repatriation from Niger in 2014, and is believed to be living in Turkey.",

That trial also was condemned by Ukraine as a violation of international law.\nWhen the trial of Aidar members began in 2023, Ukraine’s human rights envoy, Dmytro Lubinets, denounced it as “shameful” and charged that “Russia is making criminals out of those who defended their native land.”\nAidar’s spokesman Ivan Zadontsev denounced the proceedings as “a political show trial to punish our servicemen” and vowed to “continue to lobby for the release of our prisoners of war.”\nMemorial, a prominent Russian human rights group, has designated the defendants as political prisoners. It has argued that the trial violated international conventions protecting POWs, noting the defendants were facing trial just because they served with the Aidar battalion, not over any specific war crimes.\n“This grossly violates the provisions of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits the prosecution of prisoners of war solely for their participation in an armed conflict,” Memorial said.\nRussia has labeled both the Azov and Aidar groups as terrorist organizations and accused their members of war crimes. The volunteer units were created soon after Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, and they took active part in fighting against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\nAidar, Azov and other volunteer units eventually were integrated into the Ukrainian military. Both Aidar and Azov have been criticized over their origins as volunteer battalions that included fighters from far-right circles, although current members reject accusations of extremism and any ties to ultra-nationalist movements.\nWhen the trial of Aidar members began in 2023, it initially involved 18 members. Two nurses who served with the battalion also went on trial, but they were returned to Ukraine in a prisoner swap. Proceedings against a driver serving with the battalion will be held separately.\nThe trial was held in a military court in the city of Rostov-on-Don, home to Russia’s Southern Military District. It is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the border with Ukraine.\nMost of the trial was held behind closed doors, but journalists were allowed to cover the opening sessions and Friday’s verdict.",

No date for the meeting has been set.\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social that he will discuss his call with Putin “and much more” when he meets Zelenskyy on Friday, adding that “I believe great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation.”\nMeanwhile, eight Ukrainian regions experienced blackouts after the barrage, Ukraine’s national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said. DTEK, the country’s largest private energy company, reported outages in the capital, Kyiv, and said it had to stop its natural gas extraction in the central Poltava region due to the strikes. Natural gas infrastructure was damaged for the sixth time this month, Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state-owned oil and gas company, said.\nRussia fires hundreds of drones and 37 missiles\nZelenskyy said Russia fired more than 300 drones and 37 missiles at Ukraine overnight. He accused Russia of using cluster munitions and conducting repeated strikes on the same target to hit emergency crews and engineers working to repair the grid.\n“This fall, the Russians are using every single day to strike our energy infrastructure,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.\nThe Ukrainian power grid been one of Russia’s main targets since its invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago. Attacks increase as the bitterly cold months approach in a Russian strategy that Ukrainian officials call “weaponizing winter.” Russia says it aims only at targets of military value.\nUkraine has hit back by targeting oil refineries and related infrastructure that are crucial for Russia’s economy and war effort. Ukraine’s general staff said Thursday its forces struck Saratov oil refinery, in the Russian region of the same name, for the second time in two months. The facility is located some 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Moscow made no immediate comment on the claim.\nUkraine seeks air defenses and attack missiles\nUkrainian forces have resisted Russia’s bigger and better-equipped army, limiting it to a grinding war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern regions.\nBut Ukraine, which is almost the size of Texas, is hard to defend from the air in its entirety, and Kyiv officials are seeking more Western help to fend against aerial attacks and strike back at Russia.\nZelenskyy was expected to arrive in the United States on Thursday, ahead of his Oval Office meeting with Trump on Friday.\nUkraine is seeking cruise missiles, air defense systems and joint drone production agreements from the United States, Kyiv officials say. Zelenskyy also wants tougher international economic sanctions on Moscow.\nThe visit comes amid signs that Trump is leaning toward stepping up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock in U.S.-led peace efforts.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday in Brussels that if Russia won’t budge from its objections and refuses to negotiate a peace deal, Washington “will take the steps necessary to impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression.”\nAlso, Trump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally assured him that his country would stop buying Russian oil. That would deny Moscow income it needs to keep fighting in Ukraine.\nWashington has hesitated over providing Ukraine with long-range missiles, such as Tomahawks, out of concern that such a step could escalate the war and deepen tensions between the United States and Russia.\nBut Trump has been frustrated by his inability to force an end to the war in Ukraine and has expressed impatience with Putin, whom he increasingly describes as the primary obstacle to a resolution.\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an assessment published late Wednesday that sending Tomahawks to Ukraine would not escalate the war and would only “mirror Russia’s own use of … long-range cruise missiles against Ukraine.”\nUkraine engages with American defense companies\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s Economy Ministry said Thursday it has signed a memorandum of understanding with U.S. company Bell Textron Inc. to cooperate in aviation technology.\nThe Fort Worth, Texas-based aerospace and defense company will open an office in Ukraine and establish a center for assembly and testing, while exchanging know-how and training Ukrainians in the United States, according to a ministry statement.\nUkraine, unsure what it can expect from Western allies, is keen to develop its own arms industry.\nOn Wednesday, a Ukrainian government delegation met during a U.S. visit with prominent American weapons manufacturers Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.\n___\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "body": "US stocks drop on worries about banks\nUS stocks drop on worries about banks\nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, hurt by drops for midsized banks as worries flare about the loans they’ve made.\nThe S&P 500 slid 0.6% in its latest up-and-down day after erasing a morning gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 301 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.5%.\nZions Bancorp. tumbled 13.1% after the bank said its profit for the third quarter will take a hit because of a $50 million charge-off related to loans made to a pair of borrowers. Zions said it found “apparent misrepresentations and contractual defaults” by the borrowers and several people who guaranteed the loans, along with “other irregularities.”\nAnother bank, Western Alliance Bancorp, dropped 10.8% after saying it has sued a borrower, alleging fraud. It also said it’s standing by its financial forecasts given for 2025.\nScrutiny is rising on the quality of loans that banks and other lenders have broadly made following last month’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing of First Brands Group, a supplier of aftermarket auto parts. The question is whether the hiccups are just a collection of one-offs or a signal of something larger threatening the industry.\nThursday’s swings on Wall Street, where the Dow bounced from an early gain of 169 points to an afternoon loss of 472, fit the pattern of the week for stocks. They’ve been shaky since the end of last week, when President Donald Trump shattered a monthslong calm in the U.S. stock market by threatening much higher tariffs on China.\nThursday’s swoon erased an early morning gain driven by an encouraging signal about the artificial-intelligence boom.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a bigger jump in profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang also said TSMC expects “continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies” going into the end of the year.\nThat’s important for the U.S. stock market because TSMC is a critical player in the AI frenzy, making chips for such companies as Nvidia. And Nvidia and other AI stocks have been central to Wall Street’s surge to records this year, even though inflation is still high and the job market is slowing.\nAI-related stocks have shot so high that critics worry about a possible bubble, like the one that imploded for dot-com stocks in 2000.\nU.S. companies broadly are under pressure to deliver stronger profits after the S&P 500 surged 35% from a low in April. To justify those gains, which critics say made their stock prices too expensive, companies will need to show they’re making much more in profit and will continue to do so.\nTravelers dropped 2.9% Thursday even though the insurer reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise fell 10.1% after detailing long-term financial targets that some analysts found underwhelming.\nThey helped overshadow a 4% gain for Salesforce, which unveiled a plan to deliver more than 10% in compounded annual revenue growth in coming years.\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services trucked 22.1% higher after the freight company breezed past Wall Street’s profit targets in the third quarter.\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 41.99 points to 6,629.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 301.07 to 45,952.24, and the Nasdaq composite sank 107.54 to 22,562.54.\nIn the oil market, crude prices swung lower after Trump agreed to meet with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Hungary in hopes of resolving the war in Ukraine. The war has had the United States trying to cut off purchases of Russian oil.\nA barrel of U.S. crude gave up an early gain to drop 1.4% to $57.46. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.4% to $61.06 per barrel.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes climbed across much of Asia and Europe.\nSouth Korea’s Kospi soared 2.5% on hopes that a trade deal may be coming between Seoul and Washington. Samsung Electronics and automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp. were among the big gainers.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields dropped as investors herded toward investments considered safer.

    "body": "India seeks to import more US oil and gas under pressure from Trump to stop Russian oil purchases\nNEW DELHI (AP) — India says it is looking to step up purchases of crude oil and natural gas from the U.S. as it diversifies its energy supplies and confronts criticism by U.S. President Donald Trump over its imports of discounted Russian oil.\nTrump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had personally assured him his country would stop buying Russian oil, in a move that might add to pressure on Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\n“There will be no oil. He’s not buying oil,” Trump said. The change won’t take immediately, he said, but “within a short period of time.”\nIndia is the second biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. Trump cited its purchases from Moscow when he announced 50% tariffs on imports from India in August.\nA statement Thursday by India’s foreign ministry did not address Trump’s remarks directly. It said the government’s consistent priority was to safeguard the interests of Indian consumers in a volatile energy environment.\n“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” said Randhir Jaiswal, a ministry spokesman.\nHe said the Trump administration had shown interest in deepening energy cooperation and talks on that were underway.\nExpanding India’s energy dealings with the U.S. could help India mitigate supply disruptions and align with Washington’s push to reduce global dependence on Russian oil.\nIndia’s Trade Secretary Rajesh Agarwal said Wednesday that India was willing to increase its purchases of American oil and natural gas if prices were competitive.\nAgarwal told reporters India has been buying around $12-$13 billion worth of crude oil and gas from the U.S. annually and there was room to nearly double that without causing disruptions for Indian refiners.\nA team of Indian government officials was visiting the U.S. to discuss a bilateral trade agreement that includes energy cooperation, he said.\n“In discussions we are in, we have indicated very positively that India as a country would like to diversify its portfolio as far as energy imports are concerned. That’s the best strategy for a big buyer like India,” said Agarwal.\nIn February, Modi and Trump set a target of finalizing the first tranche of a trade agreement by autumn. Talks were suspended after five formal rounds of negotiations after Trump expressed displeasure over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil. He said that was helping to fuel Moscow’s war against Ukraine.\nTrump has been frustrated by his inability to force an end to the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s invasion almost four years ago. He’s expressed dissatisfaction with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he increasingly describes as the primary obstacle to a resolution, and he’s scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.\nIn recent weeks, Modi has engaged positively on Trump’s social media posts, including the one about first stage of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, suggesting New Delhi is keen to expand cooperation with the U.S. In turn, Trump called Modi his “friend” and wished him well on his birthday last month.",

It reported a net profit of a record 452.3 billion new Taiwan dollars ($15 billion) in the July-September quarter, higher than analysts’ forecasts.\nThe company earlier said its revenue jumped 30% year-on-year in the last quarter.\nTSMC has been building chip fabrication plants in the United States and Japan to help hedge against risks from China-U.S. trade tensions. The chipmaker is a major supplier to companies such as Apple and Nvidia.\n“Demand for TSMC’s products is unyielding,” Morningstar analysts wrote in a note this month. “Given TSMC’s dominance, we doubt the company would be hindered if it faced tariffs on shipments to U.S. customers. We expect AI demand to stay resilient.”\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick proposed last month that computer chip production be divided 50-50 between Taiwan and the U.S. Taiwan -- where the majority of global chip manufacturing is currently based -- rejected that idea.\nThe company has committed $100 billion in U.S. investments, including building new factories in Arizona, on top of $65 billion that it pledged earlier.",

Smucker Co. is suing Trader Joe’s, alleging the grocery chain’s new frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are too similar to Smucker’s Uncrustables in their design and packaging.\nIn the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in Ohio, Smucker said the round, crustless sandwiches Trader Joe’s sells have the same pie-like crimp markings on their edges that Uncrustables do. Smucker said the design violates its trademarks.\nSmucker also asserted that the boxes Trader Joe’s PB&J sandwiches come in violate the Orrville, Ohio-based company’s trademarks because they are the same blue color it uses for the lettering on “Uncrustables” packages.\nTrader Joe’s boxes also show a sandwich with a bite mark taken out of it, which is similar to the Uncrustables design, Smucker said.\n“Smucker does not take issue with others in the marketplace selling prepackaged, frozen, thaw-and-eat crustless sandwiches. But it cannot allow others to use Smucker’s valuable intellectual property to make such sales,” the company said in its lawsuit.\nSmucker is seeking restitution from Trader Joe’s. It also wants a judge to require Trader Joe’s to deliver all products and packaging to Smucker to be destroyed.\nA message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Trader Joe’s, which is based in Monrovia, California.\nMichael Kelber, chair of the intellectual property group at Neal Gerber Eisenberg, a Chicago law firm, said Smucker’s registered trademarks will help bolster its argument. But Trader Joe’s might argue that the crimping on its sandwiches is simply functional and not something that can be trademarked, Kelber said.\nTrader Joe’s sandwiches also appear to be slightly more square than Uncrustables, so the company could argue that the shape isn’t the same, Kelber said.\nUncrustables were invented by two friends who began producing them in 1996 in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. Smucker bought their company in 1998 and secured patents for a “sealed, crustless sandwich” in 1999.\nBut it wasn’t easy to mass produce them. In the lawsuit, Smucker said it has spent more than $1 billion developing the Uncrustables brand over the last 20 years. Smucker spent years trying to perfect Uncrustables’ stretchy bread and developing new filling flavors like chocolate and hazelnut.\nKelber said one of the biggest issues companies debate in cases like this one is whether the copycat product deceives consumers.\nSmucker claims that’s already happening with Trader Joe’s sandwiches. In the lawsuit, Smucker showed a social media photo of a person claiming that Trader Joe’s is contracting with Smucker to make the sandwiches under its own private label.\nThis isn’t the first time Smucker has taken legal action to protect its Uncrustables brand. In 2022, it sent a cease and desist letter to a Minnesota company called Gallant Tiger, which was making upscale versions of crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with crimped edges. Smucker said Wednesday that it hasn’t taken further action but continues to monitor Gallant Tiger.\nSmucker likely felt it had no choice but to sue this time around, Kelber said.\n“For the brand owner, what is the point of having this brand if I’m not going to enforce it?” Kelber said. “If they ignore Trader Joe’s, they are feeding that, and then the next person who does it they won’t have an argument.”\nKelber said trademark cases often wind up being settled because neither company wants to go through an expensive trial.\nSmucker’s lawsuit comes a few months after a similar lawsuit filed against the Aldi by Mondelez International, which claimed that Aldi’s store-brand cookies and crackers have packaging that is too similar to Mondelez brands like Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins and Oreos.",

    "body": "Ontario premier criticizes Trump after Stellantis says it will move production from Canada to the US\nOntario premier criticizes Trump after Stellantis says it will move production from Canada to the US\nTORONTO (AP) — The leader of Canada’s most populous province called for economic retaliation on the U.S. after auto company Stellantis said it was moving planned production of its Jeep Compass from Canada to the U.S.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the company’s decision this week to shift production of the SUV from Brampton, Ontario, to Illinois as part of plan to invest $13 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States.\nThe comments come as Canada is negotiating to reduce tariffs. Trump has been urging the Big 3 American automakers to move production to the U.S.\n“That guy, President Trump, he’s a real piece of work,” Ford said. “I’m sick and tired of rolling over. We need to fight back.”\nFord said Canada needs to hit back with tariffs if Prime Minister Mark Carney can’t reach a trade deal with Trump.\nDominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, is in Washington this week for talks to reduce tariffs on certain sectors. Carney left Washington last week without a deal.\nCarney said the move by the world’s fourth-largest carmaker was a direct consequence of tariffs and his government would work with Stellantis to create new opportunities in the Brampton area. Carney added that Ottawa expects Stellantis to fulfill its commitment to Brampton workers. The federal government threatened legal action against the company.\nFederal Industry Minister Mélanie Joly said the production shift is “unacceptable” and warned Stellantis made commitments to Canadian production in exchange for substantial financial support.\n“Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,” Joly wrote in a letter to the company chief executive.\nFear has spread in Ontario over what will happen to Canada’s auto sector. Autos are Canada’s second-largest export and Carney has noted the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.\n“Stellantis is bowing at the Trump administration with this pledge of massive investments in the U.S.,” Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n“If this bullying tactic works with Stellantis I expect it to be replicated to every other automaker that has a presence in Canada and frankly other sectors that the U.S. has an interest in.”\nWorkers at the Stellantis assembly plant in Brampton were greeted Wednesday with a robocall from their employer that said work they’d been waiting for wouldn’t be coming back. The company closed the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers as it retooled the facility.\nStellantis said it would reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to expand U.S. Jeep production, creating thousands of new jobs there.\nVito Beato, president of Unifor Local 1285, which represents the Brampton plant workers, said the news came as a surprise because Stellantis had said previously it was committed to producing its Jeep Compass in Brampton.\nStellantis said it continues to invest in Canada, including adding a third shift to the Windsor, Ontario assembly plant, and that it is in talks with the government on the future of the Brampton facility.\nCarney won the country’s election earlier this year fueled by Trump’s annexation threats and trade war, but has tried to improve relations ahead of a review of the free trade deal next year. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. and Canada recently dropped many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact.\nFord said Canada should start responding to Trump’s tariffs with its own harsh measures.\n“That’s the only thing that this person understands,” Ford said of Trump. Ford is scheduled to meet with Carney this week.",

He was 101.\nMurayama died at a hospital in his hometown Oita, southwestern Japan, according to a statement by Mizuho Fukushima, the head of Japan’s Social Democratic Party.\nAs head of what was then known as the Japan Socialist Party, Murayama led a coalition government from June 1994 to January 1996.\nA historic apology for Japan’s actions in World War II\nHe is best remembered for the “Murayama statement,” an apology he issued on the 50th anniversary of Japan’s unconditional surrender ending World War II on Aug. 15, 1995. It’s seen as Japan’s main expression of remorse for its wartime and colonial past.\n“During a certain period in the not too distant past, Japan, following a mistaken national policy, advanced along the road to war ... and, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations,” he said in the statement.\n“In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology.”\nA government marked by controversy\nMurayama was first elected to parliament in 1972 as a socialist lawmaker after working for a labor union and serving in a local assembly.\nWhen he became prime minister in 1994, he broke with his party’s longtime opposition to the Japan-U.S. security alliance and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces, recognizing them as constitutional in a speech given in the face of yelling by angry members of his party.\nIn 1995, Murayama dealt with two major disasters: a massive earthquake in the western port city of Kobe that killed more than 6,400 people, and a Tokyo subway gas attack that killed 13 and injured more than 6,000 people. He came under fire for slow responses to both.\nHe resigned early the following year in an unexpected announcement that came as he returned to work after the 1996 New Year holidays. Murayama said he had done what he could in a year marking the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. He said he made the decision while looking at the blue sky in the new year.\nMurayama criticized his successors for questioning Japan’s wartime guilt\nMurayama was active in politics even after his retirement in 2000, frequently criticizing attempts by his more nationalist successors to back away from responsibility for Japan’s wartime action.\nThe Murayama statement set a standard followed by all prime ministers for nearly two decades, until nationalist Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stopped apologizing in 2013 as members of his Liberal Democratic Party said it interfered with Japan’s national pride. That included Abe’s protege Sanae Takaichi, who was recently elected party leader and is now poised to become prime minister next week.\nThis year, outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed “remorse” over the war, marking the first time a Japanese leader has used the word in their annual Aug. 15 address since Abe shunned it.\nMurayama also criticized the government’s reluctance to acknowledge that the Japanese government during World War II systematically forced Asian women to provide sex for Japanese soldiers at military brothels.\n“A historical view saying Japan’s war was not aggression, or calling it justice or liberation from colonialism, is absolutely unacceptable not only in China, South Korea or other Asian countries but also in America and Europe,” Murayama said in a statement in 2020.\nHe also stressed the importance of Japan establishing a lasting friendship with China, noting the “tremendous damage” his country caused to its neighbor because of its past war of aggression. “In order to build peace and stability in Asia, we must build stable politics, economics, cultural interactions and development.”",

    "body": "Police in Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of cross-border strikes after ceasefire ends\nISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s military carried out strikes in southeastern Afghanistan on Friday just hours after a two-day ceasefire between the neighboring countries expired, an Afghan police official said.\nThe bombings struck southeastern Paktika province and two other areas close to the Pakistan border, and included a strike on a civilian house in Khanadar village that resulted in casualties, police spokesman Mohammadullah Amini Mawia said. He gave no further details, including how the strikes were delivered.\nThere was no immediate comment from Pakistan about the Afghan claim.\nThe ceasefire that began Wednesday had halted several days of fighting that killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds. It ended Friday evening with no formal announcement of an extension, though diplomatic efforts to halt the hostilities were underway and Qatar reportedly offered to host peace talks.\nThe strikes in southeastern Afghanistan came hours after Pakistani officials said that a suicide car bomber backed by the Pakistani Taliban attacked a compound of security forces near the border, killing several people in the area. The attack in Mir Ali, a city in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, also triggered an intense shootout that left at least six militants and one soldier dead, police said.\nThe Pakistani Taliban, considered a terrorist organization by Pakistan officials, is separate from Afghanistan’s Taliban but affiliated with it, and Pakistan officials accuse them of operating from bases across the border.\nA faction of Pakistani Taliban headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction claimed responsibility for the suicide attack in Mir Ali, local police official Irfan Ali said.\nIn Kabul, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said a Taliban delegation was preparing to leave for Qatar. He said “in general, the policy of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is clear and consistent: we do not seek war with Pakistan or with anyone else.”\nPakistan’s state-run media on Friday night reported that a high-level Pakistani delegation will travel to Qatar for talks with Afghanistan on Saturday. Pakistan TV gave no further details, however.\nIn Islamabad, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan earlier told reporters that he was not in a position to share any information about possible talks with Afghanistan, and that the ministry would issue a statement when any such talks happen.\nAli said Islamabad wants Kabul to keep anyone from using Afghan soil for attacks inside Pakistan and that Pakistan’s recent strikes were only aimed at targeting militant hideouts.\nPakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since January, mostly blamed on the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. It has strained ties between Islamabad and Kabul as Pakistan says the group is being sheltered in Afghanistan.\nPakistan’s military has carried out multiple operations against militants in the region this week, killing 102 militants, according to security officials and police in the region.\nThe recent clashes between the two countries were the deadliest since 2021, when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan following the collapse of the Western-backed government as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew after 20 years of war.\nTensions have remained high along the border since last week when Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out a strike in the Afghan capital, a claim Pakistan’s government and military have not acknowledged. Pakistani security officials, however, said the strike was aimed at targeting Noor Wali, the head of the Pakistani Taliban.\nThe Pakistani Taliban shared a video Thursday claiming Wali is alive and in hiding somewhere in northwestern Pakistan.\nThe growing tension between the two sides is also expected to hit Afghan refugees illegally residing in the country.\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was informed that Pakistan had sent back 1.4 million Afghans under a phased plan that began in 2023, according to a government statement. It cited Sharif as saying that only Afghans with valid Pakistani visas would be allowed to stay in the country.\n___\nAbdul Qahar Afghan in Jalalabad, Afghanistan and Riaz Khan in Peshawar, Pakistan, contributed to this report.",

He was named prime minister in June.\nThe political upheaval comes at a critical time because the budget for next year has yet to be passed. Teachers, who are demanding salary hikes in the budget, went on strike this week and medical doctors are threatening to do so too.\nThe ruling party feud began after Zandanshatar lost a party leadership election to Amarbayasgalan.\nThe prime minister’s supporters then accused the speaker of being involved in corruption in the coal mining industry and a government investigation was launched.\n“We are fighting against the theft of the nation’s wealth that has robbed every Mongolian, and we are working to increase the salaries of teachers and doctors,” Zandanshatar said during the debate before the vote on his removal.\nAmarbayasgalan had requested on Thursday that he be allowed to resign from his role as speaker of parliament to restore his honor and defend parliamentary democracy.\n“The obsession for power among those who lost the election, and their lawless, arbitrary actions within the executive branch, are unlawfully influencing law enforcement agencies, in violation of the Constitution,” he said.\nThe vote on the prime minister’s fate came after a parliamentary committee voted against his dismissal.\nThe full parliament was then asked if it supported the committee’s decision. In such decisions, lawmakers who don’t vote are counted as “no” votes. The “no” votes were a clear majority, so Zandanshatar was dismissed.\nSome backers of the prime minister boycotted the parliament session on Thursday, delaying the vote for one day by denying the 126-member body the quorum needed for a vote.",

MAS received so few votes in the Aug. 17 elections that it almost lost its legal status as Bolivians expressed a prevailing desire for change.\nNow, the question is how much change do Bolivians want — and how fast.\nThe next president’s immediate task must be to draw dollars into Bolivia and import enough fuel to ease the shortage. Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, a right-wing former president who has run and lost three times before, envisions a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and a shock fiscal adjustment.\nHis rival Rodrigo Paz, a centrist senator, says he’ll scrounge up the cash by legalizing the black market, phasing out wasteful subsidies and luring Bolivians’ hoarded dollars back into the banking system.\nIn the midst of the country’s worst economic crisis in four decades, several ambivalent voters interviewed Thursday in El Alto, the sprawling city overlooking the capital of La Paz, doubted that either candidate could succeed in digging Bolivia out of its hole.\n“It’s not going to be solved quickly, it’s going to take time,” said Luisa Vega, a 63-year-old vendor of teddy bears at a frigid open-air market, knitting out of boredom because she had no customers. “Almost no one had confidence in the previous politicians. Who is going to have confidence now?”\nFrom the border, a glimpse into currency chaos\nBefore dawn on the shores of Lake Titicaca, rafts piled high with bread, fuel, cooking oil and eggs slip across the border to Peru, where state-subsidized goods fetch triple what they do at home.\nSmugglers in the border town of Desaguadero, two hours from La Paz, make little attempt to hide. Border guards look away.\nWith the official exchange rate between the boliviano and the dollar all but collapsed, it has become dirt cheap for Peruvians to shop in Bolivia and lucrative for Bolivians to sell in Peru. One Peruvian sol is worth nearly four bolivianos on the black market.\n“Crises are opportunities,” said Ronald Vallejos, who travels twice a week to hawk flour and sugar in Peru. Dollars are sold at a steep premium so Vallejos arrives with stacks of bolivianos to trade for soles, later stashing the bills under his mattress and floorboards.\nBecause of strict price controls and dollar scarcity, Bolivia can’t scrape together enough cash for imports. Food shortages have become a part of life. Queues snake outside subsidized bakeries. Empty shelves send shoppers on scavenger hunts for oil and rice.\nAuthorities blame smugglers for the scarcity and sky-high prices of staples — even as the black market is more a consequence of the shortages than the cause.\n“Gratuitous spending, speculation, and smuggling are worsening the situation, increasing prices by up to 300% in some cases,” said Jorge Silva, the deputy minister of consumer protection. It’s a tough job in this bankrupt country; Silva said he was recently chased out of a street market when he tried to monitor prices.\nPaz walks a tightrope between the left and right\nPaz, 58, is struggling to strike the balance between appeasing Bolivians’ desperation for change and courting working-class voters, many of whom are disillusioned MAS supporters who see Quiroga’s austerity as a recipe for recession.\nRather than focusing on foreign investors as the key to development, Paz hopes to uncover hidden cash by cracking down on corruption and formalizing the black market. He proposes legalizing smuggled vehicles, offering tax amnesties to Bolivians who declare their stashed dollars and allowing the cross-border smugglers to register as vendors.\n“There will be no more smuggling, everything will be legal,” he declared at his closing campaign rally Wednesday.\nPaz’s running mate, Edman Lara, has emerged as the real star of the campaign, helping the senator pull off a shock victory in the first round of elections. He captured first place after weeks of polling far behind Quiroga.\nAhead of Sunday’s vote, Quiroga is again leading opinion polls.\nThe underdog status has helped endear the privileged son of former President Jaime Paz Zamora (1989-1993) to the public.\n“Everyone is against him, the mainstream media, the pollsters, they want him to lose,” said Salomé Ramírez, 37, waiting at a bus stop in downtown La Paz. “That means he gets my vote.”\nCaptain Lara, as the vice presidential candidate is known, became something of a folk hero a few years ago after being fired from the police for denouncing corruption in viral TikTok videos.\nThe ex-officer has no political experience and an awkward habit of making populist promises — like universal income for women — in rousing speeches that contradict Paz’s goal of restoring fiscal order.\nAlthough Paz has walked back some of Lara’s more expensive proposals like fivefold increases to pensions, they both insist on balancing tough, free-market reforms with MAS-style social protections.\n“Paz and Lara are visiting places that other presidents haven’t, they’re reaching the poorest people who need their help the most,” said José Torres Gómez, a 28-year-old student in El Alto.\n‘Tuto’ promises a bitter pill\nAs the country’s inflation rate hits its highest level since 1991, Quiroga, 65, is betting that Bolivians want whatever the complete opposite of MAS looks like.\n“We will change all the laws,” he told supporters at his final campaign rally. “We will change Bolivia.”\nIf elected, Quiroga — who graduated from Texas A&M University and worked for IBM in Austin, Texas — would trigger a major geopolitical realignment in a country that for the past two decades has shunned the U.S. and cozied up to China and Russia.\nLast month, Quiroga flew to Washington for what he said were meetings with “people who can get us out of this rut,” promising progress in talks on a $12 billion bailout from the IMF, Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank that would restore public confidence in the boliviano and allow Bolivia to immediately source more fuel.\nAt rallies, he pitches the potential windfalls from foreign investment in Bolivian gas exploration and lithium production, a contentious issue due to Indigenous communities’ opposition to water-intensive extraction on their lands.\nSome Bolivians, wary of American meddling in their affairs since the bloody U.S.-led war on drugs, balk at these gestures. Others feel reassured by Quiroga’s commitment to 180-degree change and speak of Paz and Lara as the latest incarnation of ruinous left-wing populism.\n“There are big differences between the candidates,” said Antonio, 58, a struggling textile importer who declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals from the outgoing government. “With Paz and Lara, we’ll continue the past 20 years of economic disaster.”\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "body": "An army colonel who led a lightning-fast coup takes over as Madagascar’s president\nAn army colonel who led a lightning-fast coup takes over as Madagascar’s president\nANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — An army colonel who seized power in a military coup was sworn in as Madagascar’s new leader Friday in a lightning-fast power grab that ousted the president and sent him fleeing the country and into hiding.\nCol. Michael Randrianirina, the commander of an elite army unit, took the oath of office to become the new president at a ceremony in the main chamber of the nation’s High Constitutional Court, in front of its nine red-robed judges.\nHis ascent to the presidency came just three days after he announced that the armed forces were taking power in the Indian Ocean island of around 30 million people off Africa’s east coast.\nCall for unity\nThe nation had been rocked by three weeks of youth-led anti-government protests that started with frustration over chronic water and electricity outages but snowballed into anger with the leadership of President Andry Rajoelina. At least 22 people were killed in the protests after an initial crackdown by security forces, the United Nations said.\n“Today marks a turning point for our nation, for the Madagascan people themselves are thirsting for profound change in the way our country is governed,” Randrianirina said in a speech from a podium next to a red, green and white Madagascan flag. He called for peace and unity and promised to “break away from the harmful practices of the past.”\nThe U.N. has condemned the military takeover as an unconstitutional change of government but there has been little significant reaction from other countries, including Madagascar’s former colonial ruler, France. The takeover led to Madagascar being suspended from the African Union.\nMadagascar is widely known as the world’s largest vanilla provider and the home of the stripy-tailed primates called lemurs, but it also has a tumultuous history of political instability.\nThe country has seen several coups and attempted coups since gaining independence in 1960, including the one that first brought Rajoelina to power as a transitional president in 2009. Despite championing the hopes of the youth, Rajoelina has been criticized for doing little to improve the lives of Madagascans, with around 75% of the population living in poverty, according to the World Bank.\nOusted president is in hiding\nRajoelina’s whereabouts are unknown after he left the country claiming his life was in danger following the rebellion. He reportedly escaped on a French military plane. In his absence, Rajoelina was impeached in a vote in parliament on Tuesday, right before the colonel announced the military was taking power.\n“The previous president failed to listen to the youth — and this is the result,” said Emmanuel Rabemanantsoa, a young Madagascan who had taken part in the Gen Z-led protests.\nRandrianirina, who is believed to be 50 or 51 years old, swapped his military camouflage for a dark suit and blue tie for the swearing-in ceremony, which was attended by military officers, civilian officials and foreign diplomats. Military guards of honor on either side of the room drew ceremonial swords to mark the moment, and a line of soldiers blew trumpets.\nThe colonel, who emerged from relative obscurity to lead the rebellion by his CAPSAT military unit less than a week ago, was briefly imprisoned two years ago for an attempted mutiny. He said he spent most of the three months he was detained in late 2023 and early 2024 at a military hospital.\nUp to 2 years of military rule\nRandrianirina has said Madagascar will be run by a military council with him as president for between 18 months and two years before any new elections, meaning the young people who inspired the uprising may have a long wait before they are able to choose a leader. Analysts question if the youth uprising was pounced on by the military to seize power.\nThe protests have echoed other Gen Z-led uprisings in Nepal, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Young Madagascans first took to the streets last month to rail against water and power outages, but have raised other issues, including the cost of living, the lack of opportunities and alleged corruption and nepotism by the elite.\nRandrianirina seized on the momentum last weekend when he and his soldiers joined the anti-government protests that called for the president and government ministers to step down. There was a brief clash between his soldiers and gendarmerie security forces still loyal to Rajoelina, during which one CAPSAT soldier was killed, the colonel said.\nBut there has been no major violence and Randrianirina’s troops have been cheered while riding through the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, in armored vehicles and their takeover celebrated by Madagascans.\nRandrianirina said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday that the military takeover was a move to “take responsibility as citizens and patriots” to save “a dying country.”\nCoup condemned\nRajoelina’s office has said a move earlier this week by the High Constitutional Court to invite Randrianirina to become the new president was flawed and claimed that some of the court’s judges had been threatened to sign off on an illegal coup.\nOn Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the unconstitutional change of government and called “for the return to constitutional order and the rule of law,” his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said. The African Union said it “totally rejects” the takeover.\nThe European Union called for the restoring of “democratic values” in Madagascar through a national dialogue, a spokesperson said.\n___\nImray reported from Cape Town, South Africa.\n___\nMore AP news on Madagascar: https://apnews.com/hub/madagascar",

Michael Randrianirina, who seized power following weeks of large anti-government protests by mainly young people:\nA former governor\nHe is from the southern region of Androy — one of Madagascar’s poorest — and he served as its governor between 2016 and 2018. Before that, he was the commander of an infantry battalion in the neighboring Atsimo-Andrefana region.\nHe has long been a vocal critic of Andry Rajoelina, the Madagascar president he ousted in a coup this week.\nArrested for attempted mutiny\nRandrianirina was arrested in November 2023 — just before that year’s presidential election — and accused of planning a mutiny. He was sent to the notorious Tsiafahy Prison.\nHe has said that he spent around three months in detention, but most of it in a military hospital rather than the prison, which has a reputation for harsh conditions.\nHe was ultimately sentenced to a one-year suspended prison term for undermining state security and was released in early February 2024, after Rajoelina was reelected for a second term.\nOperating ‘in the shadows’\nRandrianirina said he was detained with another military officer and they retained their status as officers after being released. But Randrianirina said he had no command post to return to and so “I worked in my house, I cooked, I played soccer.”\nHe said the two were military officers working “in the shadows” at that time.\nIt’s not clear when he became the commander of the elite CAPSAT military unit that rebelled against Rajoelina and overthrew him.\nNew leader\nRandrianirina made his move last Saturday when his soldiers rebelled and joined the anti-government demonstrations, and he called for Rajoelina’s resignation.\nHis appearance riding on an armored car among the protesters and accompanying them to a main square to demonstrate meant he emerged as the leader of the uprising, which before that time had no visible figure in charge.\nRandrianirina’s military coup has been condemned by the United Nations and by the African Union, which suspended Madagascar’s membership.\n___\nMore AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

    "body": "A US senator claims ‘Christian mass murder’ is occurring in Nigeria. The data disagrees\nA US senator claims ‘Christian mass murder’ is occurring in Nigeria. The data disagrees\nLAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz has been trying to rally fellow evangelical Christians and urge Congress to designate Nigeria as a violator of religious freedom with unfounded claims of “Christian mass murder,” which the government of the West African nation has vehemently rejected as false.\nCruz, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wants Nigeria to be designated a country of particular concern as one with “severe violations” of religious freedom. Designated countries include Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. A designation could result in U.S. sanctions. The bill he introduced last month is awaiting action by the Senate and there is no certainty of it being approved.\nCruz’ claims have been amplified by some celebrities and commentators in the U.S., without evidence, with some going as far as alleging a “Christian genocide.” Cruz’ office did not respond to questions, including about his motivation for the allegations.\nHere’s what to know.\nBoth Christians and Muslims are killed\nNigeria’s 220-million-strong population is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.\nAttacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.\nWhile Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.\nBoth Muslim and Christian communities, and groups, have at various times alleged “genocide” during religiously motivated attacks against both sides. Such attacks are often in the north-central and northwestern regions struggling, among other forms of violence, with farmer-herder conflict that is between farming communities — predominantly Christians — and Fulani herders who are mainly Muslims.\nJoseph Hayab, a former chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna state, among the worst hit by the insecurity, disputed claims of “Christian genocide.”\nWhile thousands of Christians have been killed over the years, “things have been better than what they were before,” Hayab said, warning, however, that every single death is condemnable.\nNigeria’s government rejected Cruz’ claims, which have been discussed among Nigerians. “There is no systematic, intentional attempt either by the Nigerian government or by any serious group to target a particular religion,” Information Minister Idris Muhammed told The Associated Press.\nNigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 in what the State Department called “systematic violations of religious freedom.” The designation did not single out attacks on Christians. The designation was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit.\nResponding to the latest claims from U.S. commentators, the Christian Association of Nigeria said it has worked to draw attention over the years to “the persecution of Christians in Nigeria.”\nIn its 2024 report, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom highlighted attacks targeting both Christians and Muslims in what it called systematic religious freedom violations in Nigeria. “Violence affects large numbers of Christians and Muslims in several states across Nigeria,” the commission added.\nWhat the data says\nData collected by the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data program shows 20,409 deaths from 11,862 attacks against civilians in Nigeria between January 2020 and this September.\nOf those, 385 attacks were “targeted events against Christians … where Christian identity of the victim was a reported factor,” resulting in 317 deaths, ACLED says.\nIn the same period, there were 417 deaths recorded among Muslims in 196 attacks.\nWhile religion has been a factor in Nigeria’s security crisis, its “large population and vast geographic differences make it impossible to speak of religious violence as motivating all (the) violence,” said Ladd Serwat, senior Africa analyst at ACLED.\nAnalysts reject claims of genocide\nAnalysts say Nigeria’s complex security dynamics do not meet the legal definition of a genocide. The U.N. convention on preventing genocide calls it acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”\n“If anything, what we are witnessing is mass killings, which are not targeted against a specific group,” said Olajumoke Ayandele, an assistant professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs who specializes in conflict studies. “The drumming-up of genocide might worsen the situation because everyone is going to be on alert.”\nChidi Odinkalu, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and a former chairman of Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission, said Nigerian authorities, however, need to address the rampant violence.",

Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said two people died and 163 patients were treated at the scene with 34 of them referred to hospitals.\nThe Kenyan Red Cross said the chaos “left many in need of urgent care.” A source at the country’s main referral hospital said they had received dozens of patients.\nOdinga’s brother, Oburu, urged Kenyans on Friday night to be calm and mourn peacefully.\n“Raila should not be teargassed in death. He has been teargassed enough when he was alive, please let us not cause a situation where he is teargassed again,” he said.\nHeavy security after 3 died Thursday\nThousands filled the stadium where Odinga’s casket was covered in the national flag for an Anglican Church service. They chanted and held up portraits of Odinga, while some carried twigs, a symbol of peace and unity in Kenyan tradition.\nThere was heavy security at the stadium after three people died during Thursday’s public viewing as police tried to control a huge crowd at another stadium.\nAt least 10 people were injured at Thursday’s event after police fired live bullets and tear gas at a surging crowd trying to reach a pavilion where the casket was placed.\nAn honored statesman\nOdinga ran for Kenya’s presidency five times over three decades, and although he never succeeded in becoming president, he is revered for a life of activism that helped steer Kenya toward becoming a vibrant multiparty democracy.\nOdinga’s body lay in state in Parliament on Friday morning ahead of the funeral, an honor only reserved for the president and former presidents.\nPresident William Ruto said Odinga deserved the honor for having been a legislator for 15 years, adding that he played “a pivotal role in shaping some of the most consequential laws in our Republic’s history.”\nRuto campaigned for Odinga in 2007 — a disputed election that was marred by violence. The two men were rivals in subsequent elections, including the most recent one in 2022.\nThe two leaders signed an agreement this year after months of anti-government protests, and the pact saw opposition party members appointed to Cabinet positions.\nOn Friday Ruto led the mourners in singing Odinga’s favorite song, Harry Belafonte’s “Jamaica Farewell,” and said Odinga helped him steady the nation earlier in the year.\n“Whenever the nation needed him to rise above (the) self, he always did so unreservedly,” he said.\nDavid Kodia, the Anglican bishop who led the service, urged the leaders present to be “selfless” like Odinga and to shun corruption. Odinga was a practicing member of the church.\nPolitical analyst Herman Manyora told The Associated Press that the love displayed by so many mourners was a reflection of his work for democracy.\n“You can’t point at a man more willing to sacrifice everything just for the sake of his people,” said Manyora, who is based at the University of Nairobi.\nOdinga’s family pay tribute\nAmong the mourners were Odinga’s wife Ida, daughters Winnie and Rosemary, and son Raila Odinga Junior.\nIda urged Kenyans to mourn peacefully and said her husband hated dishonesty and greed. Winnie, who was with him in India, led the mourners to chanting in the local Luo language. She said her father died “strong, with dignity and pride” after he pushed his morning walk from his usual two to five rounds around the hospital where he was being treated.\nHis son Junior, donning his father’s beaded hat and a fly whisk, said he would take care of the family as the sole surviving son.\nKenyans will on Saturday have one more opportunity to view Odinga’s body in the western city of Kisumu, near his rural home in Bondo where he will be buried on Sunday. His family said he had requested to be buried quickly, ideally within 72 hours, which is unusual for popular leaders in this East African country.",

Biya’s party has rejected Tchiroma’s claim of victory and accused the opposition candidate of trying to disrupt the electoral process. The constitutional court is expected to announce the final official results by Oct. 26.\nTchiroma alleged Wednesday that there were signs of vote tampering, echoing civil society groups’ earlier reports of “several irregularities,” including attempted ballot stuffing.\nThe office of the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement in the western city of Dschang was set ablaze Wednesday night, and videos of the burning building were shared widely on social media and in local news outlets.\nThe party’s secretary general, Jean Nkuete, said in a statement the party will “initiate legal action against the individuals found guilty of the fire.”\nTensions escalate\nPockets of protests broke out Wednesday night in several cities over the allegations of election fraud.\nDozens of protesters in the economic capital, Douala, located in Wouri department, erected barricades on the roads and set them on fire while security forces used tear gas and water cannon to disperse them. No deaths or injuries have been reported yet.\nSome protested outside the office of Elections Cameroon, or ELECAM, the independent electoral management body.\nThe Prefect of Wouri, Sylyac Marie Mvogo, said police arrested a score of people who tried to force themselves into the building and allegedly attacked employees.\n“We don’t want people taking the law into their own hands. There are competent authorities responsible for handling election matters,” Mvogo, told the state-run radio CRTV.\nAnalysts have predicted a victory for Biya as the opposition remained divided and his strongest rival was barred from running in August. Eleven opposition candidates were on the ballot.\nTchiroma, who is in his late 70s, was a government spokesperson and employment minister under Biya but quit the government earlier this year to launch his presidential run. His campaign drew large crowds and backing from a coalition of opposition parties and civic groups.\nBiya has been in power since 1982, nearly half his lifetime, making him Cameroon’s second president since independence from France in 1960.\nDuring Biya’s decades in power, the Central African nation of nearly 30 million people has struggled with challenges from a deadly secessionist movement in the west and chronic corruption that has stifled development despite rich natural resources like oil and minerals.\n___\nFollow AP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

Thousands of officials have been purged including high-profile political rivals.\nHe, who was elevated to the Central Military Commission in 2022, has not been seen in public for months — often the first indication an official is in trouble. The announcement Friday was the first confirmation of what had happened to him.\nHe also was one of the 24 members of the Politburo, the second-highest Communist Party body after the 7-member Politburo Standing Committee.\nHe was formerly head of the Eastern Theater Command, which holds primary responsibility for operations against Taiwan should hostilities break out.\nThe eight other dismissed officials include the director of the Central Military Commission’s political work department, Miao Hua, who was put under investigation last November.\nThe commission, chaired by Xi, is the top military body in China.\n“(The offenses) were of grave nature, with extremely harmful consequences,” Zhang said. He did not provide details of the alleged crimes.\nThe announcement came just days before the party holds a major meeting in Beijing to map out the country’s goals for the next five years.\nEight of the nine military leaders removed Friday were members of the party’s Central Committee, the 205-member body that meets next week.\nExpelling them from the Communist Party clears the way for appointing replacements on the committee, said Neil Thomas, a Chinese politics expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n“This move is a political show of force and a practical step to elevate non-voting alternates into full members of the Central Committee,” he said.\nHigh-ranking officers occupy an elevated position in Chinese politics and can command extensive privileges, official and unofficial.\nAnalysts say the anti-corruption campaign, which is popular with the public, has also been used to enforce loyalty to Xi among party and government officials.\nIn June last year, China announced that former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor Wei Fenghe were expelled from the Communist Party and accused of corruption.\n___\nLeung reported from Hong Kong.",

In April, former Costa Rica President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias said the U.S. had canceled his visa. In July, Vanessa Castro, vice president of Costa Rica’s Congress, said that the U.S. Embassy told her the U.S. had revoked her visa citing alleged contacts with the Chinese Communist Party.\nPanama has become especially sensitive to the U.S.-China tensions because of the strategically important Panama Canal.\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in February on his first foreign trip as the top U.S. diplomat and called for Panama to immediately reduce China’s influence over the canal. Panama has strongly denied Chinese influence over canal operations, but has gone along with U.S. pressure for the Hong Kong-based company operating ports on both ends of the canal to sell its concession to a U.S. consortium.\nMulino has said that Panama will maintain the canal’s neutrality.\n“They’re free to give and take a visa to anyone they want, but not threatening that if you don’t do something, I’ll take the visa,” Mulino said Thursday. He noted that the underlying issue — the conflict between the U.S. and China — “doesn’t involve Panama.”\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "body": "MI5 chief says China is a security threat to UK as officials trade blame over spy case collapse\nMI5 chief says China is a security threat to UK as officials trade blame over spy case collapse\nLONDON (AP) — China poses a daily threat to Britain’s security, the head of the country’s domestic intelligence agency said Thursday, remarks that step up pressure on authorities to explain why the prosecution of two men charged with spying for Beijing collapsed just before they were due to stand trial.\nThe government, prosecutors and opposition politicians, who were in power until last year, have traded blame over the failed criminal case as the United Kingdom tries to balance between challenging and engaging with the Asian superpower.\n“Do Chinese state actors present a U.K. national security threat? The answer is of course yes they do, every day,” MI5 Director-General Ken McCallum told reporters during a rare public appearance. He said his agency had intervened to stop a threat from Beijing as recently as the past week.\nMcCallum said Beijing-backed meddling has included cyberespionage, stealing technology secrets and “efforts to interfere covertly in U.K. public life.”\nChina spying allegations\nAcademic Christopher Berry and parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash were charged last year with providing information or documents to China that could be “prejudicial to the safety or interests” of the U.K.\nThen, last month, prosecutors dropped the charges.\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson pointed at the government, saying officials refused to testify under oath that China was a threat to national security at the time of the alleged offenses, between 2021 and 2023.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer denies interfering, and late Wednesday the government published witness statements submitted by Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins describing China as “the biggest state-based threat to the U.K.’s economic security” and saying Beijing’s espionage activities “harm the interests and security of the U.K.”\nMcCallum called Britain’s relationship with China a “complex” mix of risk and opportunity, and said MI5 agents “detect and deal, robustly, with activity threatening U.K. national security.”\n“Of course I am frustrated when opportunities to prosecute national security-threatening activity are not followed through for whatever reason,” he said, but added that prosecution decisions were out of MI5’s hands.\nCash and Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act, a century-old statute that covers spying for countries deemed enemies of the U.K. It has since been replaced by new national security legislation.\nThe two men deny wrongdoing, and the Chinese Embassy on Thursday called the allegations “pure fabrication and malicious slander.”\n“China never interferes in other countries’ internal affairs,” an embassy spokesperson said.\nBritish intelligence authorities have ratcheted up warnings about Beijing’s covert activities, and Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee labeled Beijing a “strategic threat” in 2023.\nStarmer’s center-left Labour Party government has tried cautiously to reset ties with Beijing after years of frosty relations over spying allegations, human rights concerns, China’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong.\nThe spying controversy erupted as British officials consider China’s application to build a huge new embassy near the Tower of London that would be the biggest diplomatic complex in Europe. Critics say its scale and central location bring heightened risks of spying and sabotage.\nOn Thursday the government postponed the deadline for a final decision from Oct. 21 until Dec. 10.\nRussia and Iran\nIn his annual speech outlining major threats to the U.K., McCallum painted a stark picture, saying the U.K. faces “multiple overlapping threats on an unprecedented scale” from both terror groups and states. He said China is one of the “big three” state threats, along with the more reckless Russia and Iran.\n“State threats are escalating,” he said, with a 35% increase in the past year in the number of people MI5 is investigating for espionage.\nHe alleged that Russia and Iran are increasingly using “ugly methods,” including “surveillance sabotage, arson or physical violence.”\n“Russia is committed to causing havoc and destruction,” he said. “In the last year, we and the police have disrupted a steady stream of surveillance plots with hostile intent aimed at individuals Russian leaders perceive as their enemies.”\nHe said Tehran is also plotting to injure and kill its enemies on British soil, with more than 20 “potentially lethal Iran-backed plots” disrupted in the past 12 months.\nAI risks\nThe U.K.’s official terror threat level stands at “substantial,” meaning an attack is likely, and McCallum said MI5 has disrupted 19 late-stage attack plots since 2020.\nHe said attacks increasingly tend to come from small groups or individuals rather than broad networks, and suspects are getting younger, with one in five of those arrested last year under the age of 17.\nSome plotters are motivated by al-Qaida and the Islamic State group – which are “once again becoming more ambitious” – and others by extreme right-wing ideology, he said. Still others reflect a messy stew of motivations bred in “squalid corners of the internet.”\nThe spy chief also said MI5 was looking at potential threats from out-of-control AI.\n“Artificial intelligence may never ‘mean’ us harm,” he said. “But it would be reckless to ignore the potential for it to cause harm.”",

Odinga died on Wednesday in India at the age of 80, after collapsing during a morning walk. Efforts to resuscitate him at a hospital in India’s Kerala state were unsuccessful.\nAs the chartered plane with Odinga’s body landed on Thursday morning in Nairobi, it was given a water cannon salute, with firetrucks creating an arch of water over the aircraft.\nTensions first spiked during a planned ceremonial reception by close family and top leaders at the airport as mourners demanded to view the body. Later, crowds walked alongside the military vehicle carrying Odinga from the runway while waving twigs.\nAt the stadium, tensions rose when a crowd surged and tried to breach a pavilion where the casket was placed, prompting police to fire live bullets and tear gas.\nMourners fled toward the stadium gates, and a stampede erupted, leaving an unknown number of people injured. Meanwhile, President William Ruto, members of the Odinga family and other dignitaries at the stadium remained locked inside a room for safety.\nAfter calm returned, the public viewing took place hours later outside the stadium gates.\nOdinga was a respected and significant figure in Kenya, a veteran politician lauded by many for his fight for democracy.\n“We are in mourning as a country. We loved Baba so much, he was the defender of the people,” said Beatrice Adala, one of the mourners at the airport. Like many, she called Odinga “Baba,” a Kiswahili honorific reserved for a beloved father figure.\nOdinga will be given a state funeral Sunday at his rural home of Bondo, in western Kenya. According to his family, he had requested to be buried quickly, ideally within 72 hours, which is unusual for popular leaders in this East African country.\nFriday has been declared a public holiday and Kenyans are expected to gather at a different soccer stadium in Nairobi for a state funeral service. Another public viewing will be held on Saturday in the western county of Kisumu, close to Odinga’s rural home.\nRuto, who won the 2022 election against Odinga but later signed a political pact with him to appoint opposition members to the Cabinet, mourned him as “a patriot of uncommon courage, a pan-Africanist, a unifier who sought peace and unity above power and self-gain.” The president also declared seven days of national mourning for Odinga.\nOdinga ran for Kenya’s presidency five times over three decades — sometimes with enough support that many believed he might win.\nAlthough Odinga never succeeded at becoming president, for many he was a revered figure and statesman whose activism helped steer Kenya into a vibrant multiparty democracy.\nHe came close to taking the presidency in 2007, when he narrowly lost to incumbent Mwai Kibaki in a disputed election marred by ethnic violence.\nOdinga then served as prime minister from 2008 to 2013 in a unity government put together with the mediation of the international community.\nIn 2017, a court nullified the presidential election — a first in Africa — after Odinga challenged it, but he decided to boycott the subsequent repeat vote, asserting it wouldn’t be credible without reforms.\n___\nAP’s Africa coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

The Americans hole a putt and we hole a putt on top it and it happened every single time.\n“The unfortunate thing is people aren’t remembering that and they are remembering the week for the wrong reason. I would like to shift the narrative and focus on how good the European team were and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup.”\n‘More international’\nMcIlroy has been keen to play in India for some time as he seeks to make his schedule “more international.” In November, he’ll play in Abu Dhabi and at the European tour’s season-closing tournament in Dubai, and then at the Australian Open in December.\n“I think over the last few years, I’ve enjoyed it even more — I’ve enjoyed the travel,” he said. “I’ve enjoyed getting to play in front of people that I’ve never played in front of before.”\nAs a self-confessed cricket “sicko,” McIlroy said he was disappointed he wouldn’t be able to squeeze in attending a match in India’s favorite sport during his trip.\n“I’d love to come back and do that,” he said.\n___\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

    "body": "How Promote Giving, a new investment model, will raise millions for charities\nHow Promote Giving, a new investment model, will raise millions for charities\nThe first foreign trip Joel Holsinger took in 2019 after joining the board of directors at the global health nonprofit PATH convinced him that he needed to do more to raise money for charities.\nThe investment manager, who is now also a partner and co-head of alternative credit at Ares Management Corp., saw firsthand how a tuberculosis prevention program was helping residents of Dharavi, India’s largest slum. He also saw that the main hurdle to expanding the program’s success was simply a lack of funding.\n“I wanted to do something that has purpose,” Holsinger told The Associated Press. “I wanted a charitable tie-in to whatever I do.”\nShortly after returning from India, Holsinger created a new line of investment funds where Ares Management would donate at least 5% of its performance fee, also known as the “promote,” to charities. The first two funds of the resulting Pathfinder family of funds alone have raised more than $10 billion in investments and, as of June, pledged more than $40 million to charity.\nHolsinger wanted to expand the model further. On Wednesday, he announced Promote Giving, a new initiative to encourage other investment managers to use the model, which launches with funds from nine firms, including Ares Management, Pantheon and Pretium. The funds that are now part of Promote Giving represent about $35 billion in assets and could result in charitable donations of up to $250 million over the next 10 years.\nUnlike broader models like ESG investing, where environmental, social and governance factors are taken into account when making business decisions, or impact investing, where investors seek a social return along with a financial one, Promote Giving seeks to maximize the return on investment, Holsinger said. The donation only comes after investors receive their promised return and only from the manager’s fees.\n“We’re not doing anything that looks at lower returns,” Holsinger said. “It’s basically just a dual mandate: If we do good on returns for our institutional investors, we will also drive returns that go directly to charity.”\nCharities, especially those who do international work, are in the midst of a difficult funding landscape. The dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development and massive cuts to foreign aid this year have affected nearly all nonprofits in some way. Those nonprofits who don’t normally receive funding from the U.S. government still face increased competition for grants from organizations who saw their funding cut.\nKammerle Schneider, PATH’s chief global health programs officer, said this year has shown how fragile public health systems are and has reinforced the need for “agile catalytic capital” that Promote Giving could provide.\n“There is nothing that is going to replace U.S. government funding,” said Schneider, adding that the launch of Promote Giving offers hope that new private donors may step in to help offer solutions to specific public health problems. “I think it comes at a time where we really need to look at the overall architecture of how we’re doing this and how we could be doing it better with less.”\nSal Khan, founder and CEO of Khan Academy, which offers free learning resources for teachers and students, says the structure of Promote Giving could provide nonprofits stable income over several years that would allow them to spend less time fundraising and more time on their charitable work.\n“It’s actually been hard for us to raise the philanthropy needed for us to have the maximum impact globally,” said Khan. While Khan Academy has the knowledge base to expand rapidly around the world and numerous countries have shown interest, Khan said the nonprofit lacks enough resources to do the expensive work of software development, localization and building infrastructure in every country.\nKhan hopes Promote Giving can grow into a major funder that could help with those costs. “We would be able to build that infrastructure so that we can literally educate anyone in the world,” he said.\nHolsinger hopes for that kind of growth as well. He envisions investment managers signing on to Promote Giving the way billionaires pledge to give away half their wealth through the Giving Pledge and he hopes other industries will develop their own mechanisms to make charitable donations part of their business models.\nKate Stobbe, director of corporate insights at Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose, a coalition that advises companies on sustainability and corporate responsibility issues, said their research shows that companies that establish mission statements that include reasons for existing beyond simply profit generation have higher revenue growth and provide a higher return on investment.\nHaving a common purpose increases workers’ engagement and productivity, while also helping companies with recruitment and retention, said Stobbe, who said CECP will release a report that documents those findings based on 20 years of data later this week. “Having initiatives around corporate purpose help employees feel a connection to something bigger,” she said. “It really does contribute to that bottom line.”\nThat kind of win-win is what Holsinger hopes to create with Promote Giving. He said many of the world’s problems don’t lack solutions. They lack enough capital to pay for the solutions.\n“We just need to drive more capital to these nonprofits and to these charities that are doing amazing work every day,” he said. “We’re trying to build that model that drives impact through charitable dollars.”\n_____\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Here are some tributes to Odinga, who was 80.\n___\n“Raila Odinga was a towering figure in Kenya’s political life and a steadfast champion of democracy, good governance, and people-centered development. His decades-long commitment to justice, pluralism, and democratic reform left an indelible mark not only on Kenya but across the African continent. He inspired generations of leaders, including myself, and citizens alike through his courage, resilience, and unwavering belief in the power of dialogue and democratic institutions.” —- Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, chairperson of the African Union Commission\n___\n“He was a towering statesman and a cherished friend of India. I had the privilege of knowing him closely since my days as Chief Minister of Gujarat and our association continued over the years.

His legacy is not just in the political battles he fought, but in the peace he helped build. It is etched in the very fabric of our nation.” — Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who backed Odinga for president in the 2022 election\n___\n“We have lost a brilliant leader, a global African, a peace-loving and solution seeker, whose influence and love were not only in Kenya, but in East Africa and Africa at large. This tragedy is not just for Kenya, but for all of us.” — Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu\n___\n“(A) towering statesman whose legacy of democracy, justice (and) public service will endure.

    "body": "Fighting in Sudan’s besieged city triples number of displaced people in a nearby town: UN official\nPORT SUDAN, Sudan (AP) — Fighting in North Darfur’s embattled capital of el-Fasher has tripled the number of displaced people this year alone in Tawila, a town about 60 kilometers (37 miles) away, said a U.N. migration agency official.\nUgochi Daniels, deputy director general for operations at the International Organization for Migration, IOM, told the Associated Press Thursday that the conflict had also reduced el-Fasher’s own population by 62% this year. She warned that the massive displacement presents major challenges for the country, echoing other aid workers who have repeatedly labeled Sudan the world’s largest displacement crisis.\nThe recent displacement spike was fueled by intensified fighting in el-Fasher, which has seen a series of attacks in the conflict between the army and rival paramilitaries as they seek to control the city.\nThe war between the Rapid Support Forces, RSF, and the military began in 2023 when tensions erupted between the two former allies that were meant to oversee a democratic transition after a 2019 uprising.\nThe fighting has killed at least 40,000 people, according to the World Health Organization, and displaced as many as 12 million others. Over 24 million people are facing acute food insecurity, according to the World Food Program.\n“North Darfur remains the epicenter of the crisis here in Sudan and we need peace to be able to access the most difficult places where the needs are the greatest,” said Daniels.\nEl-Fasher is the military’s last stronghold in the sprawling Darfur region, which has been the epicenter of the violence along with Kordofan.\nDaniels explained that it’s hard to provide services for many people who have moved in such a short period of time, especially amid the collapse of health care and other essential services.\n‘An active war zone’\nThe conflict and resultant mass displacement have restricted access to essential services like clean water, proper nutrition, and health care.\nSudan’s Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim told the Associated Press on Wednesday that health care services have been restored in at least 60% of hospitals in areas retaken by the army, including Khartoum.\nHowever, diseases such as cholera, malaria and dengue fever remain rampant amid collapsed health care systems and destroyed infrastructure, particularly water facilities.\nSpeaking to the AP during the World Health Organization’s annual Regional Committee in Cairo, Ibrahim said that dengue has spread across at least 14 Sudanese provinces. Separately, WHO said late September that 113,629 cholera cases and 3,029 deaths have been recorded across Sudan since the outbreak was declared in July 2024.\nIbrahim said that while cholera significantly increased last year, its spread has now declined to roughly 100 cases a month due to vaccination efforts. To combat dengue and malaria, he said the ministry distributed over 15 million mosquito nets in various areas across the country but could not reach el-Fasher due to difficulty of access.\nThe minister said the amount of medical aid entering Sudan doesn’t meet the needs of the population because the trucks often get attacked or robbed before they reach communities.\nHe urged humanitarian organizations and international groups “to break this humanitarian barrier especially in Darfur,” which he described as an “active war zone with RSF presence.”\nThe minister said health professionals are often unable to expand health campaigns due to lack of funding. While hospitals in Darfur and Khartoum are still intact, they were robbed of equipment and medical resources, especially in the first year of the war, according to Ibrahim, who said total medical losses in Sudan are estimated at around $11 billion.\nAccording to Daniels, only 26% of Sudan’s overall humanitarian response plan has been funded, adding that the IOM’s own required funding stands at just 16% of its goal.\nCalling for an end to the misery and suffering endured by the Sudanese people, Daniels emphasized the need for peace and a ceasefire. “There’s no amount of assistance that can bring peace, but if we have peace, we will have access to the people that need assistance,” said Daniels.\n____\nKhaled reported from Cairo.",

So why are its government finances in such a mess?\nA political deadlock in parliament has left President Emmanuel Macron struggling to reduce an out-of-control deficit. Investors have sold off the country’s bonds. Ratings agencies have downgraded its creditworthiness.\nIt’s a major comedown for a country that, along with Germany, sets the agenda for much of what’s decided in the European Union.\nThese are some of the reasons why France got into debt trouble and what that might mean for the rest of the world.\nTriple whammy of the pandemic, war in Ukraine, and rising interest rates\nFrance last balanced its budget in 1973, and maintained a generous welfare state with strong worker protections. That worked for years when solid economic growth was sweeping tax revenue into government coffers.\nAccumulated debt was high — over 90% of annual gross domestic product from 2008 on — but manageable due to steady growth and years of near-zero interest rates.\nThen came the pandemic, followed by an energy crisis after Russia cut off most natural gas supplies following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The French government spent heavily on subsidies to keep businesses afloat and shield people from higher energy costs. Globally, interest rates suddenly moved higher.\nDebt in France jumped: from 98% of GDP in 2019 to 114% currently. The annual deficit last year ballooned beyond forecasts to 5.8%, well above the 3% limit under European Union rules.\nBig deficits raise borrowing costs as political gridlock unsettles businesses\nDeficits matters because investors demand more in return when they lend the government money. Investors sold off France’s benchmark 10-year bond, driving its interest yield higher.\nThe government must eventually pay those higher interest costs when it sells new bonds to replace older, maturing bonds.\nFrance’s 10-year bond yield, a key indicator of risk, is now 3.34%, up from below zero in 2021. That’s just below heavily indebted Italy. And France must now pay more to borrow than Greece, whose bonds yield 3.25%.\nNo consensus on a way out\nOne big reason for the bond selloff: there’s no consensus on how to reduce the deficit. Parliament’s powerful lower house is divided among left, centrist and right-wing forces after Macron called snap parliamentary elections last year. And no group has enough power to make tough decisions on either raising taxes or cutting spending.\nBoth the left-wing alliance and the right-wing National Rally of Marine Le Pen have balked at relatively modest deficit reduction as they try to force Macron to call new elections, or to resign. The stalemate has triggered four changes of government in barely a year — an upheaval unprecedented in France’s Fifth Republic, founded by Charles de Gaulle in 1958.\nMeanwhile the deadlock fuels uncertainty that unsettles business planning and investment. Higher bond interest also can raise borrowing costs for business because some loans use the government bond rate as a base for what businesses pay.\nMacron’s fourth prime minister in 13 months, Sebastien Lecornu averting being ousted by pausing plans to raise the state pension system’s baseline retirement age from 62, to 64.\nWhile Lecornu kept his job, it did nothing to reduce the deficit. He now faces weeks of debate over a budget that offers only a modest deficit reduction to 4.7%.\nA headache for all of Europe\nAs the two biggest countries in the European Union, France and Germany have a lot to say about decisions made for the 27-country European Union. And action is needed.\nEurope must help Ukraine and deter a newly aggressive Russia. It needs to figure out how to increase the EU’s productivity and growth as it faces challenges from the U.S., which has imposed higher tariffs on European goods. There are also economic threats from China, which is making technically advanced and cheaper cars that are pressuring European rivals.\nParalysis in Paris makes that work harder.\n“Ultimately, Europe requires a robust Franco-German axis to address its numerous challenges,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist at ING bank.\nA red flag for countries with large debts\nOutside of Europe, many of the world’s major economies have also run up large post-pandemic debts. The International Monetary Fund singled out France, along with Brazil, China and the United States, as countries where debt levels are likely to rise significantly. The pressure to slash deficits could limit their ability to address a crisis that rises to the level of war in Ukraine or the pandemic.\nThe U.S. debt level of 119% of annual economic output is even higher than France’s. But France lacks two key US advantages: stronger economic growth, which reduces the size of the debt compared with the size of the economy, and the world’s dominant reserve currency, the dollar. The dollar’s widespread use helps to fuel Washington’s ability to borrow.\nIt’s not a repeat of the 2010-2015 eurozone debt crisis, yet.\nMarket analysts say France isn’t in danger of defaulting on its debts. What France must avoid over the long term, however, is a death spiral in which rising borrowing costs raise questions about its ability to pay, leading to even higher borrowing costs. That is what happened to Greece in 2010-2011, leading to debt default, and to Italy, which was forced to install a technocratic government under Mario Monti that cut spending and instituted pro-growth reforms.\nSince that eurozone debt crisis more than a decade ago, the European Union has installed a bailout fund and the European Central Bank has a financial backstop ready under which it could support a member country’s ability to borrow by purchasing its bonds on the secondary market.\nBut that option is available only in the event of “unwarranted” market turmoil, as the ECB puts it - meaning they’re unwilling to bail out politicians who won’t take action.",

Yukos ultimately went bankrupt.\nTim Osborne, CEO of a holding company called GML that represents the interests of the former majority shareholders, hailed what he called a landmark ruling.\nThe Supreme Court decision “is not just a historic victory for the shareholders, it also reaffirms the fundamental principle of justice that no state, not even a rogue state like Russia, is above the law,” he said.\nHe added that “real justice requires successful enforcement, so we will now focus all our efforts on enforcing against Russian state assets worldwide” until “every penny of the award has been clawed back. GML said the amount of the award has risen to more than $65 billion when interest is factored in.",

    "body": "BBC sanctioned for failing to disclose Gaza documentary narrator’s ties to Hamas\nLONDON (AP) — Britain’s media regulator sanctioned the BBC on Friday for a “materially misleading” documentary on the lives of children in Gaza because it failed to disclose that the father of the teen narrator held a position in the Hamas administration.\nThe regulator Ofcom said the BBC breached the Broadcasting Code, saying that “had the potential to erode the very high levels of trust audiences would have expected” in a factual program about the Israel-Gaza war. It ordered the BBC to make a statement about the findings on its 9 p.m. newscast.\n“Breaches of the code that have resulted in the audience being materially misled have always been considered by Ofcom to be among the most serious that can be committed by a broadcaster, because they go to the heart of the relationship of trust between a broadcaster and its audience,” Ofcom said.\nThe BBC previously apologized after acknowledging “serious flaws” in the making of “Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone” and removed it from its online player.\nIt said Friday that Ofcom’s findings were in line with its internal review that found “significant failing” following its own accuracy guidelines. It said it would accept the penalty.\nThe documentary was narrated by Abdullah, the 13-year-old son of Ayman Alyazouri, who has worked as Hamas’ deputy agriculture minister.\nThe BBC said that the independent production company, Hoyo Films, bore the most responsibility for the failure because it didn’t share the background information regarding the narrator’s father. Hoyo Films apologized for the lapse.\nThe BBC received hundreds of complaints alleging that the documentary was biased against Israel — as well as hundreds more criticizing the program’s removal from its streaming service, Director-General Tim Davie told lawmakers earlier this year.\nA group of 500 media figures, including directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh and actor Riz Ahmed, signed a letter published by Artists for Palestine UK saying a “political” campaign to discredit the program risked dehumanizing Palestinian voices in the media.\nThe BBC has been under intense scrutiny for its coverage touching on the war in Gaza. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and others have condemned the broadcaster for livestreaming a performance by rap punk duo Bob Vylan, who led crowds at this year’s Glastonbury Festival in chanting “death” to the Israeli military.\n___\nFollow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

European soccer body UEFA has identified the trend as a threat to the integrity of games and the player trading industry worth more than $10 billion each year.\n“As alleged, Wander used his investment firm, 777 Partners, to cheat private lenders and investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by pledging assets that his firm did not own, falsifying bank statements and making other material misrepresentations about 777’s financial condition,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.\nThe indictment charging Wander with wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to commit those crimes was unsealed Thursday in federal court in Manhattan. Most of the charges carry a maximum prison term of 20 years.\nWander’s lawyer, Jordan Estes, told The Associated Press on Friday that Wander looks forward “to setting the record straight.”\n“This is a business dispute dressed up as a criminal case,” Estes said in a written statement.\nWander and 777 had failed last year in targeting their biggest capture in soccer, nine-time English champion Everton, amid increasing scrutiny of the business and a lawsuit in New York from a London-based investor.\nReporting about 777’s soccer interests, led by Norwegian soccer magazine Josimar, intensified even before Wander was elected to a board seat at the influential European Club Association, a network of hundreds of teams that shapes the Champions League and other competitions.\nWander’s firm had moved heavily into soccer in 2021, buying stakes in financially distressed clubs recovering from playing in empty stadiums during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe former chief financial officer at 777, Damien Alfalla, “is cooperating with the government,” the FBI said, and made a guilty plea this week.\n“The women and men of the SDNY and our law enforcement partners will continue to work tirelessly to protect our investors and our markets,” Clayton said.\nAnother 777 executive, Steven Pasko, also is targeted in a civil law court filing Thursday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It wasn’t immediately clear who is representing Pasko.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Dogs can be spotted laying on the warm asphalt on road shoulders, skillfully crossing six lanes of traffic like it’s a walk through the park or picking through trash on the edges of a market.\nSAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — After drubbing El Salvador’s gangs during a more than three-year state of emergency, President Nayib Bukele turned his attention this month to another persistent, but softer, problem: his country’s many, many stray cats and dogs.\n“Thousands of dogs and cats live on our streets. We want to change that, but without cruelty. We have the financial resources, but we seek expert partners to make it a model for Latin America,” Bukele wrote on X on Oct. 8. “Who wants to come and help?”\nSan Salvador struggles with a problem widely seen in cities across Latin America, as free-roaming cats and dogs sleep on the streets with no one to care for them. Dogs can be spotted lying on the warm asphalt on road shoulders, skillfully crossing six lanes of traffic like it’s a walk through the park or picking through trash on edges of a market. But they’re often underfed, sick or injured, searching for food and water.\nIt’s not clear what kind of solution Bukele, a controversial leader fond of spectacles with a well-oiled government communications machine, is aiming for, but he likes a problem that lends itself to a grand solution.\nPlus, the millennial leader appears to have a soft spot for rescues. He adopted a dog, Cyan, while he was mayor of San Salvador, the capital.\nAt the Good Fortune Rescue shelter in Zacamil, just north of the capital, Rafaela Pérez said something needed to be urgently done “because the number of abandoned animals you see daily and that are reported on social networks is minimal compared to those that really exist.”\n“We need to change this bad culture of abandoning and getting rid of animals because they are living beings,” she said.\nBukele and his allies have already taken steps to address a shortage of public institutions to care for animals, which has left cash-strapped non-governmental organizations often filling in the gaps.\nIn 2021, a government controlled by his New Ideas party made animal abuse in El Salvador punishable by prison sentences ranging from two to four years, as well as fines.\nIn 2022, his administration opened the region’s first public veterinary hopsital, the Chivo Pets Hospital. It provides services at a symbolic cost of 25 cents, or its equivalent in Bitcoin.\nPatricia Madrid of Fundación Gratitud, the head of an organization dedicated to spaying, neutering and providing care to stray dogs, has long worked with six other volunteers in the streets of Salcoatitan, around 50 miles from El Salvador’s capital. But they’ve struggled to keep up since their funding comes from just one Salvadoran woman living in the United States.\nMadrid said she hopes that her organization can work together with the government to change that.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear where the money for Bukele’s latest project will come from. He has touted earnings from buying the cryptocurrency bitcoin, but the Central American country faces mounting debt and received a $1.4 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund earlier this year.\nBukele previously enlisted help from China to build a modern public library in the main square of San Salvador.\nPraise for the animal welfare idea has also come from outside the country, from people like Niall Harbison, a Thailand-based social media influencer who said he’s “on a mission to save stray dogs around the world,” by raising money to finance their sterilization.\nHarbison responded to Bukele’s public call on a social media post on X, saying he “would love to talk about how to help.” He added that he would hop on a plane to meet with people to see what he can do.\n“I’ve always been looking for a country to partner with to show how collaboration between the private and public sectors can work — to make it so effective that other countries can copy and implement it,” Harbison wrote.\n“Let’s do it,” the social media savvy president responded.",

Some of them clashed with police while others vandalized a police vehicle. Witnesses said several people were injured in the clashes.\nThe protesters described themselves as part of the movement that led to the ouster in August 2024 of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina following a 15-year rule that critics said had become increasingly autocratic. The protesters said they were seeking more guarantees of welfare and other programs for participants in the 2024 movement.\nThe interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, invited the country’s main political parties to sign the new political charter Friday to pave the way for a raft of political reforms, though the groups did not include Hasina’s Awami League, formerly a major political force that has been banned under the interim government.\nThe document, named the “July National Charter” after the national uprising that began in July 2024, is nonbinding and the proposals for constitutional and legal changes must be approved by a new Parliament after elections, which Yunus has promised for next February.\nThe roadmap’s provisions would include bringing more checks and balances to the country’s political system to avoid authoritarian administrations, including by giving the presidency more authority to balance what had been a powerful prime minister position. It also proposes term limits for legislators, and measures to prevent conflicts of interest, money laundering and corruption.\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and eight like-minded parties signed the charter, as well as sixteen others, including smaller Islamist parties. The country’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, was initially undecided, but later agreed to sign the charter. Four left-wing parties and a newly-formed student-led party, National Citizen Party, did not take part.\nYunus told the audience gathered outside the parliament building that the signings meant a new Bangladesh was taking shape.\n“We have entered into a civilized society from barbarism,” he said.\nA National Consensus Commission formed by Yunus’ government prepared the charter after a series of talks with 30 political parties. According to the Election Commission, the country has 51 registered political parties.\nHasina, who was toppled last August after huge protests, is in exile in India and is being tried in absentia on charges of crimes against humanity. The United Nations has said that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in the weekslong uprising last year.\nYunus has promised to hold the next national election in February. But questions remain whether the election would be inclusive without Hasina’s party and its allies in the race.",

It seems unlikely to get any cooperation from Hungary, which earlier this year rolled out the red carpet for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also is wanted by the ICC over allegations of crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. Netanyahu vehemently denies the charges.\nAfter hosting Netanyahu, Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said in April that his country would begin the process of withdrawing from the court.\nThe International Criminal Court in a nutshell\nThe court was set up in 2002 and aims to hold leaders and senior officials accountable for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. It has 125 member states, but three major global powers — the United States, Russia and China — are not members. Ukraine officially joined the court in January.\nMore than 900 staff work for the court that has a budget this year of just over 195 million euros ($228 million).\nIn an indication of the problems it has getting suspects arrested, judges have issued warrants for 61 people and 30 remain at large.\nThe ICC is a court of last resort, meaning it only takes on cases when other countries’ legal systems are unable or unwilling to prosecute suspects.\nThe United States and Russia both oppose the court\nTrump’s administration has slapped sanctions on the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, some ICC judges and Khan’s two deputies. Trump accuses the court of “illegitimate and baseless actions” targeting America and Israel.\nTrump previously sanctioned Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, during his first term in the White House. The Biden administration subsequently lifted those sanctions.\nRussia also rejects the court’s authority and has issued a warrant for Khan and the ICC judge who signed Putin’s warrant.\nPutin has already traveled overseas since the warrant was issued in 2023, including to ICC member state Mongolia. He’s also traveled to China and North Korea, which are not court members.\nCountries that have left the court\nThe only other countries to have left are Burundi and the Philippines, whose former president, Rodrigo Duterte, is in custody at the court’s cell block in The Hague after he was arrested on charges of crimes against humanity linked to his government’s deadly crackdown on drugs.\nLast month, ruling military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger said that the three African nations also are withdrawing from the court, accusing it of what they say is selective justice.\nICC prosecutor is on leave amid ethics probe\nKhan has stepped down pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. He has categorically denied accusations that he tried for more than a year to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her against her will.\nNo date has been set for the investigation to be completed.",

If you belong to the PES family, you share the values that we all do,” Filibeck said after the vote at a group congress in Amsterdam. The group did not list its precise reasons for ejecting Smer.\nFico said he was disappointed by the decision.\n“If they want to punish us because we have defined marriage as a unique union between a man and a woman, that we said there are only two sexes and that we said that in these issues our law takes precedence over European law, if that’s why we have to be expelled, then it’s an honor for us,” he said.\nIn recent years, the European Union has struggled to deal with member countries like Slovakia and Hungary that are accused of rolling back the democratic standards required to join the 27-nation bloc.\nIn May, Fico was the only leader of an EU country to travel to Moscow for festivities marking the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, despite EU calls for a boycott.\nFico, who is a divisive figure at home and abroad, returned to power in 2003 after his leftist Smer, or Direction, party won a parliamentary election on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform.\nKnown for his pro-Russian views, he has openly challenged the bloc’s policies on Ukraine. Slovakia is currently holding up the latest package of EU sanctions against Russia.",

    "body": "Polish court blocks extradition and frees Ukrainian suspected in Nord Stream pipeline blasts\nPolish court blocks extradition and frees Ukrainian suspected in Nord Stream pipeline blasts\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) — A Polish court on Friday blocked the extradition to Germany of a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines and ordered his release, a ruling that was welcomed by Poland’s prime minister.\nVolodymyr Zhuravlov, 46, was arrested near Warsaw Sept. 30 on a German warrant. German prosecutors have described him as a trained diver and allege that he was part of a group that placed explosives on the pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm three years ago.\nThe Warsaw District Court rejected his extradition on Friday and ordered his immediate release.\nThe man’s lawyer, Tymoteusz Paprocki, said ahead of the hearing that “my client doesn’t admit guilt, he didn’t commit any crime against Germany and he doesn’t understand why these charges were made by the German side.” He said he also would argue that no Ukrainian should be charged with any action directed against Russia.\nJudge points to a ‘just war’\nJudge Dariusz Lubowski said as he announced his ruling that the attack on the pipelines should be understood as a military action in a “just war,” and therefore not subject to criminal responsibility on the part of an individual. He also questioned German jurisdiction for various reasons, including the fact that the explosions occurred in international waters.\nPoland, whose successive governments have been staunchly anti-Russian, has a history of opposition to the pipelines. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said it would not be in Poland’s interest to hand over the suspect.\nTusk noted in a post on X Friday that the court had rejected extradition, “and rightly so.” He added that “the case is closed.”\nPipelines drew regional opposition\nUndersea explosions on Sept. 26, 2022, severely damaged the pipelines. The damage added to tensions over the war in Ukraine as European countries moved to wean themselves off Russian energy sources, following the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which was inaugurated in 2011 and carried Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea until Russia cut off supplies at the end of August 2022.\nThey also damaged the parallel Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered service because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nGermany had previously pushed ahead with the Nord Stream 2 project despite opposition from central and eastern European countries and the U.S., which argued it would increase Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and give Russia the possibility of using gas as a geopolitical weapon.\nTusk said earlier this month that “the problem of Europe, the problem of Ukraine, the problem of Lithuania and Poland is not that Nord Stream 2 was blown up, but that it was built.” He said that “the only people who should be ashamed of and quiet about Nord Stream 2 are those who decided to build it.”\nGerman prosecutors also seeking an extradition from Italy\nAt the time of his arrest, Zhuravlov was a resident of Poland, where he lived with his wife and children, Polish prosecutors say. His wife has told Polish media her husband is innocent and that they were together in Poland at the time the pipelines were blown up.\nHe is one of two Ukrainians whose extradition German judicial authorities have been trying to secure in the case.\nA man suspected to have been one of the coordinators of the attack was arrested in Italy in August. This week, Italy’s top court annulled a lower court’s decision to order his extradition and called for another panel of judges to reassess the case, his lawyer said.\nThe German government has declined to comment on Tusk’s remarks this month, and has noted that the ongoing proceedings are in prosecutors’ hands. Neither the government nor German federal prosecutors, who are in charge of the case, had any comment on Friday’s ruling.\n___\nGeir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Zhuravlov.",

Dauda Lawal said in a statement posted on Facebook.\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the killings.\nSuch attacks are common in Nigeria’s northern region, where local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water. The farmers accuse the herders, mostly of Fulani origin, of grazing their livestock on their farms and destroying their produce.\nIn recent months, there has been an increase in attacks by armed groups who kidnap residents for ransom in northwest Nigeria, and particularly in Zamfara state.\n“We pray to God to bring an end to this security problem in Zamfara state and Nigeria,” Lawal said on Facebook.\nBuhari Morki, a resident of Gusau, told The Associated Press that the gunmen waited in the bushes along the road where law enforcement officials usually patrol.\n“The bandits were moving to a community in the area when they saw the patrol,” Moriki said.\nNigeria is also battling to contain Boko Haram insurgents in the northeast, where some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million displaced, according to the United Nations.",

Osechkin said he believes some of the men detained are from Dagestan, a majority Muslim republic in southern Russia.\nFollowing questioning, France’s anti-terror prosecution office said the four men are being kept in detention on a preliminary terror-related charge, enabling investigators to continue holding them while the probe continues.\nFrench officials did not confirm there had been an attempt on Osechkin’s life. The AP did not immediately receive a reply from the Russian Foreign Ministry over the allegations.\nA campaign of alleged Russian sabotage and attacks\nThe French intelligence service is among multiple European agencies that have been investigating what Western officials say is a broad campaign of alleged Russian sabotage and hybrid warfare targeting European allies of Ukraine. That campaign has included multiple arson attacks across Europe, as well as cyberattacks and espionage.\nFour European intelligence officials told the AP earlier this year that Moscow is threatening exiled opponents and running what they described as an assassination program targeting perceived enemies of the state. That has included attempts to assassinate high-profile figures such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while in Poland and the head of a German arms manufacturer that provides weapons to Ukraine. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\nThe Kremlin has previously denied Russia is carrying out a sabotage campaign against the West.\nOsechkin has long suspected that he could be targeted for possible assassination because of his work, even in exile in Biarritz, the beach resort town on southwest France’s Atlantic seaboard where he lives. He said there have been several threats on his life since 2022, most recently in February this year.\nHe said the suspects “circled the area” and filmed in detail the place where he regularly did livestreams on his social media channels and looked for escape routes to leave unnoticed.\nOsechkin said he believes he is only alive because French police previously provided him with protection. He said he remains at risk although French police carried out arrests in the wake of earlier death threats, adding that he and his family are often moved to safe houses when new threats emerge.\n“Those who were arrested are just a part of the overall picture, they are part of a big team,” he said.\nActivism work includes videos and accounts of Russian prisons\nDuring questioning, Osechkin said French authorities asked him about his activities and “in what way this could cause anger and aggression from the Kremlin, Putin and his intelligence services and why they are trying to kill me.”\nOsechkin sought political asylum in France after fleeing Russia under pressure from authorities over his prison activism. His group routinely publishes videos and accounts of alleged torture and corruption in Russian prisons, and he was among the first to reveal that Russia’s military was recruiting prisoners to fight in Ukraine.\nHis group, Gulagu.net, also helped bring Russian fugitive paratrooper Pavel Filatiev to France in 2022. Filatiev served in Ukraine war before being injured, and later published accounts online of what he saw, accusing the Russian military leadership of betraying their own troops out of incompetence and corruption.\nOther Russian defectors have been killed. In 2024, Spanish police found the bullet-riddled body of Russian helicopter pilot Maxim Kuzminov in southern Spain. He escaped across the front lines and into Ukraine with a helicopter in 2023. The head of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergei Naryshkin, subsequently told Russian journalists that Kuzminov was a “traitor and criminal” who was a “moral corpse.”\nOsechkin suggested other critics of President Vladimir Putin’s “regime” including Russian opposition figures and journalists are also at risk and said the goal was not only to silence him but also them.\n“This isn’t just about the killing of me as an individual,” Osechkin said, but also an attempt “to frighten other human rights activists into reducing their activity or stopping it altogether.”\n___\nBurrows reported from London.

More than a dozen emergency vehicles, including 11 fire engines and four mobile intensive care units, were dispatched to the scene of the blast on Calea Rahovei in Bucharest’s Sector 5.\nWhile the cause of the fatal blast was not immediately clear, the area’s gas distributor, Distrigaz Sud Retele, said in a statement Friday that it had received reports of a gas smell a day earlier and deployed emergency teams who shut off the supply after discovering the presence of natural gas at the building.\nThe company added that it had been called out again on Friday and found the seal applied the previous day “torn.” It expressed its “full compassion for the families of the victims and all those affected” by the blast.\nRomania’s Health Ministry said victims had been reported with polytrauma and burns. The ministry later said that one of three people killed was found dead under a concrete slab on the building’s sixth floor. At least 13 people were transported to hospitals in the capital.\nAll residents were evacuated from the building and rescuers carried out search operations to identify anyone trapped. Students and teachers at a nearby school were also evacuated as a precaution, Bucharest’s School Inspectorate said.\n“A terrible tragedy struck Bucharest today,” Stelian Bujduveanu, Bucharest’s acting mayor, said in a post on Facebook. “We are with the bereaved families and all those going through an unimaginable ordeal … We’ll leave no one alone in this tragedy.”\nVideo footage shared by emergency authorities showed the facades of corner apartments on two stories badly mangled by the blast, which appeared to have also blown out windows in neighboring apartments. Rubble was strewn across the street below.\n“Following the explosion, another nearby apartment block was affected, where detached construction elements from the building’s facade were observed,” emergency authorities said in a statement.",

No one was injured.\nThe explosion late Thursday targeting Sigfrido Ranucci, lead anchor of state-run RAI3’s Report investigative series, occurred on the eighth anniversary of the car bomb slaying of Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\nThe investigative program said the explosion was so powerful that it could have killed anyone passing by. Ranucci had just returned home at the time and his daughter had walked by a half-hour before, Report said in a statement. The blast destroyed the car, damaged another family car next to it, as well as the front gate of Ranucci’s home in Pomezia, south of Rome.\nPolice, firefighters and forensic crews reported to the scene and magistrates from the Rome district of the anti-Mafia police were investigating, Report said. Video shot by Ranucci, who has been under police protection since 2021 because of his hard-hitting investigations, showed the mangled remains of the cars and gate.\nMeloni expressed her solidarity with Ranucci and condemned what she called “the serious act of intimidation he has suffered.”\n“Freedom and independence of information are essential values of our democracies, which we will continue to defend,” she said in a statement.\nIn comments to journalists outside the offices of RAI, Ranucci said the explosion was an “escalation” of what he said were two years of threats that he believed were related to Report’s investigations into the links between the Cosa Nostra, ‘ndrangheta and far-right crime groups and notable past Mafia hits.\nAsked if the explosion would have a chilling effect on Report’s work, he said his colleagues were used to working under difficult conditions.\n“Whoever thinks they can condition the work of Report by doing something like this will get the opposite effect,” he said. “The only thing this does is maybe makes us waste some time.”\nItalian journalist unions, politicians and others also expressed solidarity.\nReport is one of the few investigative programs on Italian television and regularly breaks news involving prominent Italian politicians, business leaders and public figures. Ranucci has been sued multiple times for defamation and just this week was absolved in the latest case he had faced.\nThe blast occurred on the eighth anniversary of the Oct. 16, 2017 murder of Caruana Galizia, who wrote extensively about suspected corruption in political and business circles in Malta. Like Ranucci, she had faced dozens of libel suits intended to silence her reporting. Two men were sentenced to life in prison earlier this year after being convicted of complicity in the murder. Two other people pleaded guilty in 2022 to carrying out the murder and were sentenced to 40 years in prison.",

(AP) — Making his pitch to connect with a Republican crowd that instantly recognized him, Kentucky Senate candidate Daniel Cameron likened the gathering to a family reunion — a feel-good reminder of his status as a party stalwart in the Bluegrass State.\nCameron — a former state attorney general and unsuccessful nominee for governor, once seen by many as the obvious heir apparent to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell — is banking on that familiarity with voters to overcome tepid fundraising.\nDespite entering the Senate contest before his main GOP rivals — U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and businessman Nate Morris — Cameron lags behind in campaign cash. They’re part of a large field of candidates competing in the 2026 race to succeed McConnell, who is retiring when his current term ends.\n“I ask for your help,” Cameron told Republicans gathered in western Kentucky back in the summer. “We need volunteers. This is a grassroots campaign. Look, I’m not fueled by the establishment. I don’t have a lot of money in the bank account. But what I’ve always had is you all.”\nCampaign finance reports that emerged this week confirmed Cameron’s assessment of his bank account. They showed Cameron trailing far behind Barr during a period when candidates should be socking donations away. Dollars don’t vote, of course, but the lack of them can set off alarms.\nCameron is still widely seen as the front-runner, based on near-universal name recognition statewide from his campaigns for governor and attorney general. But can he raise enough money? Or will outside groups fill the void?\nCameron has yet to air a Senate campaign ad on TV, while Barr and Morris have filled the airwaves with early commercials.\nCameron’s sluggish fundraising drew ridicule from Barr, who had 10 times more campaign cash on hand than Cameron in the latest reports.\nIn a testy social media exchange Wednesday, Barr told Cameron: “You’re stagnant, have no money, and you already blew one statewide race” despite President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Cameron answered by pointing to a recent Barr campaign poll acknowledging that Cameron was ahead but claiming the congressman has the momentum. “Rep. Barr put out a poll that confirms what everyone already knows: I’m the front-runner,” Cameron said.\n‘Never very good at fundraising’\nOnce seen as a rising GOP star, Cameron became Kentucky’s first Black attorney general and snagged a prominent speaking role to promote Trump at the 2020 GOP convention.\nHis reputation was dimmed by his loss in the 2023 governor’s race to Democratic incumbent Gov. Andy Beshear despite Trump’s backing in a state trending Republican. Cameron’s paltry fundraising numbers could reflect some of that tarnish, though raising money has never been his strong suit.\n“Daniel’s never been very good at fundraising,” said former state Sen. Damon Thayer, a Barr supporter. “Fundraising in America, for better or for worse, is a key indicator of whether a candidate is going to be successful or not. It’s clear to me that major donors in Kentucky and across the country ... just don’t want to put their money behind Daniel Cameron.”\nCameron has insisted he will have the resources to win. His campaign sees the early spending sprees by Barr and Morris as efforts to gain something Cameron already has — favorable name recognition.\n“People here in Kentucky, you can’t buy an election,” Cameron told The Associated Press back in August. “They want to know you. They want to know your values.”\nBarr raised $1.8 million in the July-through-September quarter, while Cameron brought in $411,000, their financial reports showed. Barr had nearly $6.7 million on hand at quarter’s end, compared to about $630,000 for Cameron. Barr had a built-in advantage: he was able to transfer money from his House campaigns into his Senate campaign. Still, he’s raised several million more in donations since entering the Senate race.\nMorris raised $1 million in the recent quarter and tapped into his wealth to loan himself $3 million to jump-start his campaign. Morris ended the period with almost $1.1 million on hand but can augment that whenever he wishes. Morris has said he would spend “whatever it takes” to win.\nMorris campaign spokesperson Conor McGuinness said Cameron doesn’t have the resources to compete.\nContending for Trump’s endorsement\nThe GOP hopefuls all have one thing in common — hopes of landing Trump’s endorsement. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the last three presidential elections.\nCameron rose to prominence as a protégé of McConnell, having previously worked as the senator’s general counsel. But he sided with the president over his mentor at the outset of his Senate run, chastising McConnell for opposing a trio of Trump Cabinet nominees.\nCameron has long condemned diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. He says the country should be based on a “merit and opportunity society” that means “anything is possible for our kids and our grandkids.”\nBarr, who represents a district stretching from central Kentucky to the Appalachian foothills, says he’s the one voting for Trump’s agenda in Congress.\nMorris is running as a populist outsider willing to criticize McConnell in hopes of winning over Trump’s MAGA base. Morris staked out a hard line on immigration, supporting a moratorium on immigration into the United States until every immigrant in the country illegally is deported.\nDemocrats in the Senate race include retired Marine aviator Amy McGrath; Pamela Stevenson, a state lawmaker and former military judge advocate general; Logan Forsythe, an attorney and former U.S. Secret Service agent; and Joel Willett, a military veteran and former CIA officer. Kentucky hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate since Wendell Ford in 1992.\nOther candidates have until the early January filing deadline to enter the race.",

    "body": "Texas voters have final say on $20 billion package to secure state’s water supply\nIn this part of Texas, Longview residents stock up on bottled water in between boil notices. It’s part of life in a place where water pipes are old, corroded and falling apart.\nIn the High Plains, near Lubbock, farmers worry that their groundwater wells will run dry.\nIn North Texas, local elected leaders and business tycoons frantically search for new sources of water to meet the demand of a surging population.\nNo matter the region, there are water challenges. By one estimate, millions of Texans could face serious water shortages in five years if nothing is done.\nAnd this fall, state lawmakers hope voters will approve $20 billion for water projects over the next two decades. If voters agree, Proposition 4, on the Novemberballot, will be the biggest state investment in water in Texas history.\n“Texas has been remarkably forward-thinking in creating financing mechanisms to address water infrastructure,” said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of Texas Water Foundation, a nonprofit that educates Texans on water issues. “The challenge is that our water infrastructure needs far exceed the available funds.”\nIf adopted, the state would create a new dedicated funding source for water, wastewater and flood infrastructure across the state.\nA portion of existing state sales tax revenue — up to $1 billion annually — would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year, starting in 2027. No new taxes would be created. However, the money would only be transferred to the fund when sales tax collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. The past two fiscal years have surpassed that amoun t. Assuming the state’s growth continues, there will be enough money available to dedicate the $1 billion to the fund.\nThe Texas Water Development Board would manage the fund and allocate the money. Funding would be divided into two categories: water supply projects and other existing water programs.\nThe first bucket of money would expand the overall volume of water available in Texas. That could include the desalination of seawater and brackish water, which is the process of removing salt from seawater or salty groundwater, allowing it to be used for drinking water, irrigation, and industrial purposes. This fund would also include fixing leaking pipes, water reuse, including produced water from the oil and gas industry, conservation strategies and constructing permitted reservoirs. Some of these may be included in the State Water Plan, a guide the state uses to manage the long-term demand for water resources. It also proposes water supply solutions to meet demand and must be updated every five years.\nThe second bucket would go to existing water programs, including improving flood control infrastructure and flood mitigation, ensuring clean drinking water, and agricultural water conservation. There is no specified breakdown for how this money must be divided among these programs and allocations would be determined in the future.\nSome environmental groups are concerned that certain projects, like reservoirs, will be prioritized as a form of new water supply and take the land of farmers and residents who live in areas where they plan to be built.\n“It’s terrific to have funding for fixing leaking pipes, increasing water efficiency, and developing innovative ways to provide water supply, but we also need to focus on those aspects of water planning that aren’t working for people, specifically reservoir projects,” said Janice Bezanson, senior policy director at Texas Conservation Alliance, in an interview. The group advocates for the environment, wildlife and water conservation.\nThere appears to be no formal opposition to the amendment. However, some conservative groups have come out against the idea, arguing that spending should not be written into the Texas Constitution.\nAs part of the fund, lawmakers have created a special committee to oversee the water board’s administration of the funding, and the public will have a chance to give input on how the money is being distributed.\n“It’s not unchecked money going to the Water Development Board without accountability or oversight,” said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy for Texas 2036, at a recent Tribune event.\nA report by Texas 2036, a nonprofit think tank focused on some of the state’s thorniest issues, estimated that the state needs nearly $154 billion over the next 50 years for water infrastructure. That estimate accounts for $59 billion for water supply projects, $74 billion for leaky pipes and infrastructure maintenance, and $21 billion to fix broken wastewater systems.\nWater stressors look different across the state. In West Texas, Central Texas and along the coast, communities are in dire need of a new way to obtain water. In the East, communities are grappling with aging infrastructure that’s leaking.\nAbout 17% of retail public water systems are either at risk of failure or have already failed in 17 counties located in the Neches River Basin, according to Kelley Holcomb, general manager of the Angelina & Neches River Authority. This has led the East Texas river authority to take over and repair some of these small, rural water systems. Boil-water notices have also become the norm.\n“We issue boil-water notices on a routine basis that we have people just dedicated to do just that,” Holcomb said at a Tribune event.\nThe Texas Living Waters Project, a coalition of environmental groups, reports that Texas water systems lose at least 572,000 acre-feet per year, or about 51 gallons of water per home or business connection every day through leaky pipes and makes the case that repairing these systems could recover enough water to meet the annual needs of cities like Fort Worth, El Paso, Austin, Lubbock and Laredo combined.\nThis aging water infrastructure also contributes to boil-water notices, in which Texans experience nearly 3,000 boil-water notices each year, often due to system failures or weather-related disruptions.\nAccording to a recent survey by Texas 2036, 76% of respondents said they support Proposition 4 when informed it would invest $1 billion per year for 20 years in water infrastructure using existing sales tax revenue and no new taxes. This follows similar support in 2023, when nearly 78% of Texas voters approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund.\n“It’s up to people in their local communities that know what their local needs are to be involved … and to have your opinions about your water supply shared and to help shape those decisions for your communities,” said Jennifer Walker, a special adviser to the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund.\nEarly voting begins Oct. 20 and ends Oct. 31. Election Day is Nov. 4. The deadline for counties to receive applications to vote by mail is Oct. 24.

    "body": "Democrats say Trump needs to be involved in shutdown talks. He’s shown little interest in doing so\nDemocrats say Trump needs to be involved in shutdown talks. He’s shown little interest in doing so\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is showing little urgency to broker a compromise that would end the government shutdown, even as Democrats insist no breakthrough is possible without his direct involvement.\nThree weeks in, Congress is at a standstill. The House hasn’t been in session for a month, and senators left Washington on Thursday frustrated by the lack of progress. Republican leaders are refusing to negotiate until a short-term funding bill to reopen the government is passed, while Democrats say they won’t agree without guarantees on extending health insurance subsidies.\nFor now, Trump appears content to stay on the sidelines.\nHe spent the week celebrating an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal he led, hosted a remembrance event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk and refocused attention on the Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, his administration has been managing the shutdown in unconventional ways, continuing to pay the troops while laying off other federal employees.\nAsked Thursday whether he was willing to deploy his dealmaking background on the shutdown, Trump seemed uninterested.\n“Well, look, I mean, all we want to do is just extend. We don’t want anything, we just want to extend, live with the deal they had,” he said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. Later Thursday, he criticized Democratic health care demands as “crazy,” adding, “We’re just not going to do it.”\nGovernment shutdown\nThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?\nSpokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Democrats must first vote to reopen the government, “then we can have serious conversations about health care.”\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune echoed that approach before leaving for the weekend, saying Trump is “ready to weigh in and sit down with the Democrats or whomever, once the government opens up.”\nThune said he’d also be willing to talk, but only after the shutdown ends.\n“I am willing to sit down with Democrats,” Thune posted on social media Friday.\n“But there’s one condition: End the Schumer Shutdown. I will not negotiate under hostage conditions, nor will I pay a ransom,” he added.\nFrustration is beginning to surface among rank-and-file Republicans, with bipartisan conversations breaking out on the Senate floor as members look for ways to move things forward. Still, even those Republicans admit little happens in Congress without Trump’s direction.\nLeaving the Capitol on Thursday, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, “We’re not making much headway this week.” For things to progress, Murkowski acknowledged Trump may need to get more involved: “I think he’s an important part of it.”\n“I think there are some folks in his administration that are kind of liking the fact that Congress really has no role right now,” she added. “I don’t like that. I don’t like that at all.”\nTrump has not been slowed by the shutdown\nWhile Congress has been paralyzed by the shutdown, Trump has moved rapidly to enact his vision of the federal government.\nHe has called budget chief Russ Vought the “grim reaper,” and Vought has taken the opportunity to withhold billions of dollars for infrastructure projects and lay off thousands of federal workers, signaling that workforce reductions could become even more drastic.\nAt the same time, the administration has acted unilaterally to fund Trump’s priorities, including paying the military this week, easing pressure on what could have been one of the main deadlines to end the shutdown.\nSome of these moves, particularly the layoffs and funding shifts, have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, ruling that the cuts appeared politically motivated and were carried out without sufficient justification.\nAnd with Congress focused on the funding fight, lawmakers have had little time to debate other issues.\nIn the House, Johnson has said the House won’t return until Democrats approve the funding bill and has refused to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Democrats say the move is to prevent her from becoming the 218th signature on a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on releasing documents related to the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.\nSo far, the shutdown has shown little impact on public opinion.\nAn AP-NORC poll released Thursday found that 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of the Democratic Party, similar to an AP-NORC poll from September. Four in 10 have a “somewhat” or “very” favorable view of the Republican Party, largely unchanged from last month.\nDemocrats want Trump at the table. Republicans would rather he stay out\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have said Republicans have shown little seriousness in negotiating an end to the shutdown.\n“Leader Thune has not come to me with any proposal at this point,” Schumer said Thursday.\nFrustrated with congressional leaders, Democrats are increasingly looking to Trump.\nAt a CNN town hall Wednesday night featuring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, both repeatedly called for the president’s involvement when asked why negotiations had stalled.\n“President Trump is not talking. That is the problem,” Sanders said.\nOcasio-Cortez added that Trump should more regularly “be having congressional leaders in the White House.”\nDemocrats’ focus on Trump reflects both his leadership style — which allows little to happen in Congress without his approval — and the reality that any funding bill needs the president’s signature to become law.\nThis time, however, Republican leaders who control the House and Senate are resisting any push for Trump to intervene.\n“You can’t negotiate when somebody’s got a hostage,” said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who added that Trump getting involved would allow Democrats to try the same tactic in future legislative fights.\nTrump has largely followed that guidance. After previously saying he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health insurance subsidies, he walked it back after Republican leaders suggested he misspoke.\nAnd that’s unlikely to change for now. Trump has no plans to personally intervene to broker a deal with Democrats, according to a senior White House official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations. The official added that the only stopgap funding bill that Democrats can expect is the one already on the table.\n“The President is happy to have a conversation about health care policy, but he will not do so while the Democrats are holding the American people hostage,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Thursday.\nA product of the Congress Trump has molded\nIn his second term, Trump has taken a top-down approach, leaving little in Congress to move without his approval.\n“What’s obvious to me is that Mike Johnson and John Thune don’t do much without Donald Trump telling them what to do,” said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\nHis hold is particularly strong in the GOP-led House, where Speaker Mike Johnson effectivelyowes his job to Trump, and relies on his influence to power through difficult legislative fights.\nWhen Republicans have withheld votes on Trump’s priorities in Congress, he’s called them on the phone or summoned them to his office to directly sway them. When that doesn’t work, he has vowed to unseat them in the next election. It’s led many Democrats to believe the only path to an agreement runs through the White House and not through the speaker’s office.\nDemocrats also want assurances from the White House that they won’t backtrack on an agreement. The White House earlier this year cut out the legislative branch entirely with a $4.9 billion cut to foreign aid in August through a legally dubious process known as a “pocket rescission.” And before he even took office late last year, Trump and ally Elon Musk blew up a bipartisan funding agreement that both parties had negotiated.\n“I think we need to see ink on paper. I think we need to see legislation. I think we need to see votes,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “I don’t accept pinky promises. That’s not the business that I’m in.”\nBoth parties also see little reason to fold under public pressure, believing they are winning the messaging battle.\n“Everybody thinks they’re winning,” Murkowski said. “Nobody is winning when everybody’s losing. And that’s what’s happening right now. The American public is losing.”\n—\nAssociated Press reporter Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Virginia AG candidates Jay Jones and Jason Miyares clash over violent rhetoric in feisty debate\nVirginia AG candidates Jay Jones and Jason Miyares clash over violent rhetoric in feisty debate\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squabbled over a host of lawyerly issues on Thursday in their first and only debate: criminal prosecutions, consumer protection and unlawful discrimination. But one matter overshadowed it all: Jones’ leaked text messages endorsing political violence toward a former colleague.\nMiyares, the Republican incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for suggesting to a Republican delegate in 2022 text messages that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get “two bullets to the head.”\nReferencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: “Character is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.”\nJones apologized for his words from the start.\n“Let me be very clear,” he said. “I am ashamed, I am embarrassed and I’m sorry.”\nStill, the Democrat rebuffed Miyares by noting that violent rhetoric can be heard on both sides of the aisle, and that President Donald Trump has been known to use extreme language at times.\n“What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?” Jones said, adding, “You haven’t said a word. I’ve taken accountability for my mistakes. It’s time you take accountability, too.”\nThe race for attorney general of Virginia has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year’s election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race. Straight-ticket voting is not an option in Virginia, which requires voters to choose candidates in each statewide contest.\nWhile Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general’s race remains fiercely competitive. Last week, it spilled over into the governor’s race when former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones’ candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.\nJones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate. The way Miyares told it, Jones’ texts about shooting a prominent Republican disqualified him from the race to be Virginia’s lead prosecutor.\nJones, in turn, spent much of his time arguing that Miyares lacked the nerve to sue the White House if the Trump administration overreached.\n“Jason hangs out with Donald Trump at MAGA rallies,” Jones said. “I will see Jason Miyares and Donald Trump in court as your next attorney general.”\nThe candidates tackled other legal matters likely to involve the attorney general’s office, including the enforcement of Virginia’s clean energy law and the scope of Virginia’s Human Rights Act, a state law prohibiting discrimination.\nMiyares and Jones also exchanged jabs on which candidate would do a better job of keeping Virginians safe. Miyares argued that Jones lacked the experience to hold criminals to account, citing a story by The Richmond Times-Dispatch of a Virginia state trooper clocking Jones speeding 116 miles per hour.\nJones, for his part, touted his record serving as a delegate in the Virginia House, where he said he supported legislation cracking down on sex offenders and human trafficking. He also referenced his experience going after ghost gun manufacturers while working in the attorney general’s office for the District of Columbia.\nAt one point, a moderator from the Virginia State Bar asked the candidates how they viewed the attorney general’s office — as a political or legal one.\n“It’s clearly a legal one, and that’s exactly why we have to hold the president accountable, go after Donald Trump and the bad actions of this administration,” Jones eagerly responded.\nMiyares side-stepped the question, saying it’s an office there to protect Virginians.\n“Jay Jones wants fights in Washington,” he said. “He’s running for the wrong office.”\n___\nOlivia Diaz is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "body": "Louisiana judge orders review of Gulf Coast liquefied natural gas facility’s climate change impacts\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Louisiana judge has tossed out a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility that won approval from President Donald Trump’s administration, ordering a state review of how the facility’s planet-warming emissions would affect Gulf Coast communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather.\nLast week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.\nThree of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.\nLouisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.\n“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.\nEarlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”\nLast year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.\nTrump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.\n“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”\nLyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”\nA spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.\n“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.\nLast year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.\nIn regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.\nBut District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.\nRichard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”\nCommercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.\n“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”\nIn August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.\nVenture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.\n___\nBrook is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "body": "2 arrested in Texas immigration detention center shooting now face terrorism-related charges\nDALLAS (AP) — Two people arrested in a July shooting outside an immigration detention center in Texas are facing new charges that follow President Donald Trump’s order last month to designate a decentralized movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.\nAutumn Hill and Zachary Evetts were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Fort Worth on charges that include providing material support to terrorists and attempting to murder officers and employees of the U.S. government. Federal prosecutors accuse them of being members of an antifa cell that planned the shooting.\nHill and Evetts were already among 11 people facing attempted murder charges related to the July 4 shooting outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, that injured a police officer.\nIn a post on X on Thursday about the new charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi called antifa “a left-wing terrorist organization,” and said, “they will be prosecuted as such.”\nShort for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.\nThe indictment said the attack began when a group of people clad in black and wearing masks, some carrying firearms and wearing body armor, shot fireworks toward the center and vandalized vehicles and a guard shed. Then, as officers responded, one person yelled, “get to the rifles” and opened fire, striking an officer, according to the indictment.\nThe indictment said that the group brought 10 firearms to the July 4 attack.\nCody Cofer, an attorney for Hill, said in an emailed statement that the new terrorism-related charge “could be understood by some as an attempt to appeal to a mob mentality rather than relying on the evidence and the law.”\nPatrick McLain, an attorney for Evetts, said that so far he’s seen “zero basis” for any of the charges against his client.\nThe original charges filed over the summer say searches related to the attack found items including anti-government materials and flyers with political messages, but those documents did not mention antifa.\nAntifa is a domestic entity and, as such, is not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department’s list of foreign terror organizations. There is no domestic equivalent to that list in part because of broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States.\nThe July 4 shooting took place as Trump ’s administration has ramped up deportations.

Trump did not put a price tag on the cost of the arch.\n“It’s going to be really beautiful,” the Republican president said. “I think it’s going to be fantastic.”\nMany presidents and first families try to leave their imprint on the White House, and Trump is already doing that with many of the design and construction changes he’s made to the property, perhaps most notably by converting the Rose Garden into a stone-covered patio.\nBut the arch goes far beyond the White House, giving Trump a chance to leave another lasting monument in a city known for them. It would expand on his earlier talk of sprucing up the city by replacing its “tired” grasses, and broken signage and street medians.\nTrump seems to draw inspiration from the French.\nThe proposed arch bears a striking resemblance to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the famous monument at the end of the Champs-Élysées honoring those who fought for France during the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars.\nA military parade held in Washington earlier this year to mark the Army’s 250th birthday was inspired after Trump witnessed a similar event down the famous Parisian boulevard eight years ago as a guest of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.\nThe White House did not immediately respond Thursday to an emailed request for more information on the arch, including the timeline for completing it.\nHarrison Design, a local firm, is working on the project, according to a weekend social media post from Trump. A representative for the firm did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment Thursday.\nIt was unclear if the White House has presented the proposal to the National Capital Planning Commission, which has responsibility over planning and siting monuments, memorials and statues in the city. The commission’s offices have been closed during the government shutdown.\nL. Preston Bryant Jr., a former chairman of the commission, said in an email that federal law requires that the proposed arch be put through the commission’s review and approval process.\nThe arch would stand at the Washington end of Memorial Bridge, which spans the Potomac River from Arlington, Virginia. At the dinner, Trump showed off three different sized models of the arch, which will feature a statue of Lady Liberty on top, and acknowledged that the largest one was his favorite.\nTrump thanked his dinner guests for being “so generous in your contributions” to pay for the ballroom and said there might be enough money left over to cover the cost of building the arch.\n“It’s fully taken care of now and, in fact, we’ll have money left over and we’ll use that for something,” he said. “We’ll use that probably maybe for the arch or something else that will come. But we love to fix up Washington.”\nThe White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so. That project was announced in late July.\n___\nAssociated Press video journalist Mike Pesoli contributed to this report.",

    "body": "North Carolina GOP’s proposed map seeks to thwart Democratic incumbent’s reelection\nNorth Carolina GOP’s proposed map seeks to thwart Democratic incumbent’s reelection\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Republican legislators offered a redrawn U.S. House district map for North Carolina on Thursday, seeking to help President Donald Trump retain GOP control of Congress by attempting to thwart the reelection of the Democrat now in the state’s only swing seat.\nState House and Senate GOP leaders unveiled the proposed boundaries in advance of next week’s General Assembly session, stepping into the national fray over mid-decade redistricting that has Democrats and Republicans battling to secure electoral advantages from coast to coast, including Texas and California. The Republicans announced earlier this week that legislators would return to Raleigh to debate and vote on a plan provided in response to Trump’s call to secure more GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nAn intensely competitive midterm election looms in which Democrats need to gain just three seats to take control of the House. The president’s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, something Trump is trying to avoid.\nRepublicans already approved a North Carolina map in 2023 that resulted in GOP candidates winning 10 of the state’s 14 U.S. House seats in 2024. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022.\nAs anticipated, Thursday’s boundaries appear, based on past election results, to focus on helping the GOP win the 1st District seat in northeastern North Carolina currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis. He won a second term in 2024 by less than 2 percentage points.\nThe retooled 1st District boundaries would take in several coastal counties and remove others inland — including Greene County, Davis’ home county — to create a little more right-leaning 1st District. Greene and others would be placed in a reworked 3rd District currently represented by Republican Rep. Greg Murphy, which based on election results would appear to become a little less GOP friendly.\nOther districts to the west would remain intact. Based on results of several past statewide elections attached to the map, Republicans would stand a decent chance to win 11 of North Carolina’s 14 seats.\nRepublican legislators provided no formal comment on the proposal while inviting online comment from the public. But with an image of the new map, Senate leader Phil Berger wrote Thursday on X that the General Assembly “is ready to help Republicans secure Congress and move @realDonaldTrump’s agenda forward!”\nThe GOP holds majorities in both the state House and Senate. The state constitution prevents Democratic Gov. Josh Stein from using his veto stamp on redistricting plans.\nThe national redistricting battle began over the summer when Trump urged Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts. After Texas lawmakers acted, California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own plan that still needs voter approval in November.\nOther North Carolina Democrats have blasted Republicans for trying to help Trump, accusing the GOP of trying to steal a seat won by Davis, who is one of North Carolina’s three Black representatives. The current 1st District contains a few majority-Black counties. A retooled 1st District could lead to litigation alleging unlawful racial bias.\nRedistricting action would happen even while North Carolina GOP legislators are more than three months late on passing a state budget and unable to finalize how to boost Medicaid spending.\n“Instead, we’re coming back to talk about redistricting because Republicans believe if they can’t win fair, they’re going to change things and cheat and win that away,” state Democratic state Rep. Sarah Crawford said Thursday at a state Democratic Party news conference.\nDavis, a former state legislator and Air Force veteran, mentioned regional concerns in a social media post Thursday evening.\nEastern North Carolina families “are struggling and feel that Washington, D.C., is broken. I understand these concerns all too well,” Davis wrote on X. “As we look at new congressional districts, I am considering every option, drawing on my local roots, experience in the military, and commitment to education.”",

He is a recent graduate student at Columbia and a legal U.S. permanent resident.\nAfter missing the birth of his first child, he was released from the immigration jail in June by a separate federal judge.\nLast month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil could be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application. His attorneys are currently challenging that decision.",

Big tech companies are the biggest user of the visa, and nearly three-quarters of those approved are from India. But there are critical workers, like teachers and doctors, who fall outside that category.\nThe Trump administration announced the fee last month, arguing that employers were replacing American workers with cheaper talent from overseas. Since then, the White House has said the fee won’t apply to existing visa holders and offered a form to request exemptions from the charge.\nIn its lawsuit, the Chamber argues that the new fee violates the immigration laws that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.\n“The President has significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the United States, but that authority is bounded by statute and cannot directly contradict laws passed by Congress,” according to the complaint, which names the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and their respective cabinet secretaries as defendants.\nPrior to Trump’s proclamation imposing the new fee, most H-1B visa applications cost less than $3,600, according to the Chamber.\n“If implemented, that fee would inflict significant harm on American businesses, which would be forced to either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled employees for whom domestic replacements are not readily available,” according to the complaint.\nThe new fee is scheduled to expire after a year, but could be extended if the government determines that is in the interest of the United States to keep it.\nHistorically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.\nCritics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.",

David Perdue, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\nJones announced his choice of the 10th district on social media and in an interview with Fox News. The open seat, stretching from Atlanta’s suburban fringe to the college town of Athens, has drawn more than 10 other Republicans already.\nJones listed his priorities as preventing federal election legislation, doing more to secure borders and protecting “medical freedoms.” Anticipating attacks from other Republicans, he tweeted: “Hell, they even call me the Black Donald Trump! Bring it on, liars!”\n“Look, I’m a conservative, I have traditional values,” he told Fox News. “The left has taken this country too far to the left. That’s why I identify with the 10th Congressional District. Those people have values like mine, conservative values, faith-based, hard working, entrepreneurial spirit, things of that nature. We have to get back to that.”\nJones was a Democratic state representative on the outs with his party when he shot to prominence as an African American who endorsed Trump’s reelection campaign. The 61-year-old served multiple terms in the Georgia House, sandwiching a troubled turn in charge of Atlanta’s suburban DeKalb County, before proclaiming himself a Republican in January 2021 as his last term expired.\nHe built his campaign for governor around Trump’s falsehoods that Georgia’s election was stolen. He promised another audit of the 2020 presidential election and to replace Georgia’s electronic voting system, often calling the election the “dead cat on the end of the line.”\nThe seat is open because U.S. Rep. Jody Hice is stepping down to run for Georgia secretary of state with Trump’s backing. The fundraising leader has been Mike Collins, the son of former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins.

Jones was never charged and a prosecutor declined to pursue an indictment, saying the woman who made the allegation did not wish to proceed with the case.\n“The voters of GA10 don’t want a corrupt, carpetbagging, lifelong Democrat from DeKalb County accused of rape representing them,” Collins tweeted. “They want a pro-Trump, America 1st fighter who’s lived, worked and raised a family in the district — it’s why we’re going to win.”\nJones shrugged off the attacks, tweeting, “The same Big Lies and Fat Smears used against Donald J. Trump in 2015 and 2016 are used against me. I’m honored but do better, @MikeCollinsGA”. “Hell, they even call me the Black Donald Trump!

    "body": "Vernon Jones quits Georgia governor bid to run for Congress\nATLANTA (AP) — One of the Republican challengers to incumbent Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp dropped out of the race Monday, a move that could help clear the way for Donald Trump-backed challenger David Perdue in Georgia’s GOP primary.\nVernon Jones, a Democrat who switched parties as part of full-throated backing of the former president, said Monday that he will run for Congress instead. However, Jones did not immediately say which of Georgia’s 14 congressional seats he will seek.\n“I believe that strong conservative voices need to be heard as we lead America into the future,” Jones said. “Because of this decision I am officially withdrawing my candidacy for governor effective today and will be supporting David Perdue for governor. He is a good man who loves our state and loves our country.”\nJones’ announcement came days after a late January meeting in which Trump pledged to endorse Jones in a congressional race if he stepped down to clear the field for Perdue, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\nThe switch helps Trump defeat Kemp, who has drawn Trump’s scorn for not backing his plan to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. Trump spent months imploring Perdue to run after Trump vowed to deny Kemp a second term, and Perdue is currently airing a television ad in which Trump endorses him for the camera.\nSpeculation has focused on Jones running for the U.S. House in the 6th Congressional District in the northern Atlanta suburbs or the 10th Congressional District, which stretches east from the outskirts of Atlanta.\nDebbie Dooley, a Republican activist and top supporter of Jones, said she expects him to run in the 10th District, where a crowded Republican field is seeking to replace incumbent U.S. Rep Jody Hice. Part of a slate of Trump-endorsed candidates in the state, Hice is running to become Georgia’s secretary of state with Trump’s backing.\nPolls had shown Jones drawing a small but significant fraction of support in the May 25 primary. His withdrawal could allow Perdue to consolidate anti-Kemp Republicans and makes it more likely that the GOP nomination will be decided without a runoff.\n“Vernon Jones is a conservative patriot who cares deeply about Georgia,” Perdue wrote in a tweet. “We need his voice and we need him in the fight. I’m proud to have his support.”\nCody Hall, a spokesperson for Kemp, attacked Jones’ endorsement as worthless, citing allegations that Jones had raped a woman in 2004. Jones was never charged and a prosecutor declined to pursue an indictment, saying the woman who made the allegation did not wish to proceed with the case. Hall also attacked Jones on other grounds, including voting against a bill restricting abortion.\n“Vernon’s support for Perdue makes sense — both have a history of paying lip service to the America First movement and putting their own egos and wallets ahead of what’s best for the people of Georgia,” Hall said.\nDooley predicted Trump would endorse Jones for Congress.\n“I look for an endorsement, and I think Vernon will make a great congressman,” Dooley said. “Trump takes care of those who are loyal to him.”\nJones was a Democratic state representative on the outs with his party when he shot to prominence in Republican circles as an African American who endorsed Trump’s reelection campaign.\nJones, 61, served multiple terms in the Georgia House, sandwiching a troubled turn in charge of Atlanta’s suburban DeKalb County, before proclaiming himself a Republican in January 2021 as his last term in the state House expired.\nHe built his campaign for governor around Trump’s falsehoods that Georgia’s election was stolen, with Jones promising an audit of the 2020 presidential election and to replace Georgia’s electronic voting system, often calling the election the “dead cat on the end of the line.”\nDooley said Perdue’s more aggressive attacks on the election results, including filing a lawsuit claiming fraudulent ballots were counted in Fulton County, will bring Jones’ supporters into line behind Perdue.\n“I think they’re seeing a fighter,” Dooley said.\nThree other Republicans besides Kemp and Perdue remain in the race, including Kandiss Taylor. Democrats, though, declared Monday that the GOP race is now a “slugfest” between Kemp and Perdue, one that they hope ultimately benefits Stacey Abrams, the only Democrat in the race.\nAbrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said Kemp and Perdue’s “nasty fight will do nothing to help our state. As Kemp and Perdue fight each other, Stacey Abrams will is fighting for Georgia.”\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct that Jones was never charged after a rape allegation.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed from New York.\n___\nFollow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.",

    "body": "Georgia governor gets GOP primary challenge from former Dem\nATLANTA (AP) — Former Democrat Vernon Jones crowd-surfed across adoring Trump supporters in October after speaking at one of the former president’s campaign rallies. Now the scandal-plagued politician hopes to surf their discontent to a Republican primary victory over Gov. Brian Kemp.\nJones announced Friday that he would challenge the incumbent governor, a frequent Trump target, in 2022.\n“You’ve seen me stand right beside Donald Trump, just like you. I have done more as a conservative fighting side by side for you and for our elections, and for America first, then the governor and all those RINOs combined,” Jones said.\nThe former legislator faces plenty of obstacles to mounting a campaign capable of toppling a sitting governor. But his bid ensures, at the least, that Kemp will continue facing questions about his refusal to help Trump overturn President Joe Biden’s narrow election victory in Georgia.\nJones was a state representative on the outs with his party when he shot to prominence in Republican circles as an African American Democrat who endorsed Trump’s reelection campaign. He’s doubled down since then in support of Trump’s false claims of election fraud.\nJones said Friday that Kemp cost Republicans the White House and two Georgia Senate seats that put Democrats in control. Kemp said he was legally required to certify Biden’s slate of presidential electors once a final tally was certified.\nJones, 60, served multiple terms in the Georgia House, sandwiching a troubled turn in charge of Atlanta’s suburban DeKalb County, before proclaiming himself a Republican in January as his last term expired. “I have left the plantation,” he declared when he switched parties.\nLast week, he tweeted that Kemp “still hasn’t discontinued the use of Dominion voting machines in the state of Georgia. I’ll do it on Day One,” alluding to false claims that the machines flipped Trump votes to Biden.\nJones said his platform includes school choice, support for police, low taxes, less regulation and environmental conservation. And because he’s Black, like Stacey Abrams, he said he can do better against the potential 2022 Democratic nominee if she challenges Kemp again.\n“We are fed a false narrative based on race-baiting, identity politics and propaganda fed to the masses,” Jones said.\nJones has posted video and pictures of himself interacting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. But it’s unclear whether Trump will support him.\nAs DeKalb executive, Jones faced investigations of an expensive security detail, and a woman accused Jones of raping her in late 2004. Jones was never charged and a prosecutor declined to pursue an indictment, saying the woman who made the allegation did not wish to proceed with the case. Jones said they had a consensual sexual encounter.\nJones oversaw hundreds of millions in capital projects as CEO, but a special grand jury later alleged he was part of an endemic culture of “incompetence, patronage, fraud and cronyism.”\nHe later lost races for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and county sheriff.\n“Vernon Jones has historically been a very effective campaigner, so you can’t underestimate him,” said state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, a Democrat from Decatur who has long tangled with Jones. “However the likelihood of him running an honest and well-respected administration with competent staffers is remote.”\nThose close to Kemp acknowledge the anger among some conservatives, but they see Jones as an ideal primary challenger — able to generate an attention-getting primary campaign, but lacking the established high profile of, say, former U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, who has topped the wish list of Trump supporters.\nKemp’s strategy will be “to remind grassroots activists that he’s been a champion for life, for economic growth and opportunity, expanding access to health and now leading the fight against cancel culture,” said Ryan Mahoney, his top campaign consultant.\nFending off Jones could help Kemp raise more money and shore up his standing among Republicans ahead of a rematch against Abrams, who can raise money nationwide and won’t likely face significant opposition from Democrats.\nKemp’s first test has begun, with county Republican parties holding annual conventions. Trump allies want to censure the governor and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for certifying Biden’s win. Murray and Whitfield counties adopted censures last week. Dozens of other local GOP committees consider similar measures on Saturday.\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct that Jones was never charged after a rape allegation.",

Jeff Landry announced that he is calling state lawmakers back to the Capitol to consider changes to next year’s election schedule, plans and code.\nIf the court strikes down the current political boundaries, pushing back the election schedule and deadlines could allow the GOP-dominated Legislature more time to craft a new map.\nUnlike past special sessions called by Landry, there is only one item listed in his proclamation: “To legislate relative to the election code, election dates, election deadlines, and election plans for the 2026 election cycle, and to provide for the funding thereof if necessary.”\nThe special session is scheduled to begin Oct. 23 and must conclude by the evening of Nov. 13.\nThe Republican-led challenge before the high court is a case that could result in the weakening of a key tool of the Voting Rights Act, which helped root out racial discrimination in voting for more than a half century.\nThe current map is the result of a hard-fought battle by civil rights groups, who say Black voter strength previously, when only one of the state’s six congressional districts was a majority-minority district. That was the case even though Black residents account for about one-third of Louisiana’s population.\nBut opponents argue that the state’s new second Black majority congressional district, which helped flipped a reliably red congressional seat to blue, was unconstitutionally gerrymandered based on race.\nDuring Wednesday’s arguments the Supreme Court’s six conservative justices seemed inclined to effectively strike down a Black majority congressional district in Louisiana because it relied too heavily on race.\nIf the court overturns the map, the ruling could open the door for legislatures to redraw congressional districts in Southern states, helping Republicans by eliminating majority Black and Latino districts that tend to favor Democrats.\nThe court is expected to rule by early summer in 2026.",

    "body": "Career experts say asking for a raise isn’t off the table in a tough job market\nNEW YORK (AP) — With the U.S. experiencing a significant hiring slowdown, it’s a daunting time to be looking for a job. Many workers are staying put instead of changing jobs to secure better pay. Artificial intelligence tools increasingly screen the resumes of applicants. Now may seem like an inappropriate time to request a raise.\nBut sticking around doesn’t mean wages and salaries have to stagnate. Career experts say it’s not wrong, even in a shaky economy, to ask to be paid what you’re worth. Raises aren’t even necessarily off the table at organizations that are downsizing, according to some experts.\n“A lot of people think if their company has done layoffs, the likelihood of getting a raise is pretty low,” said Jamie Kohn, a senior director in the human resources practice at business research and advisory firm Gartner. “And that might be true, but the the other way to think about it is that this company has already decided to reinvest in you by keeping you on.”\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\nWhen should you ask?\nIf you’ve taken on greater responsibilities at work and have received strong performance reviews, or if you’ve learned you’re paid substantially less than colleagues or competitors with similar levels of experience, then it may be the right time to ask for a pay adjustment.\n“They know that you’re taking on more work, especially if you’ve had layoffs on your team,” Kohn continued. “At that point, it is very hard for them to lose an employee that you know they now are relying on much more.”\nAnother signal that it’s time to ask for an adjustment is if you’re working a second job to make ends meet or your current financial situation is causing angst that impacts job performance, said Rodney Williams, co-founder of SoLo Funds, a community finance platform.\n“There’s nothing wrong with saying, ’Hey, I need to raise my financial position. I’m willing to do more,” Williams said. “I’m willing to show up earlier, I’m willing to leave later, I’m willing to help out, maybe, and do other things here.”\nSome people view asking for more compensation as less risky than switching to a new job. “There is a sense of not wanting to be ‘last in, first out’ in a potential layoff situation,” said Kohn.\nKnow your worth\nBefore starting the compensation conversation, do some research on current salaries. You can find out what people with comparable experience are making in your industry by searching on websites such as Glassdoor, where people self-report salaries, or ZipRecruiter, which gathers pay data from job postings and other sources.\nThree years ago, a lot of people asked for 20% pay increases because of price inflation and high employee turnover coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, Kohn said. Companies no longer are considering such big bumps.\n“Right now, I think you could say that you are worth 10% more, but you’re unlikely to get a 10% pay increase if you ask for it,” she said.\nYour success also depends on your recent performance reviews. “If you’ve been given additional responsibilities, if you are operating at a level that would be a promotion, those might be situations where asking for a higher amount might be worth it,” Kohn said.\nCompare notes with colleagues\nMany people view the topic as taboo, but telling coworkers what you make and asking if they earn more may prove instructive. Trusted coworkers with similar roles are potential sources. People who were recently hired or promoted may supply a sense of the market rate, Kohn said.\n“You can say, ‘Hey, I’m trying to make sure I’m being paid equitably. Are you making over or under X dollars?’ That’s one of my favorite phrases to use, and it invites people into a healthy discussion,” Sam DeMase, a career expert with ZipRecruiter, said. “People are way more interested in talking about salary than you might think.”\nYou can also reach out to people who left the company, who may be more willing to compare paychecks than current colleagues, DeMase said.\nBrag sheet\nKeep track of your accomplishments and positive feedback on your work. Compile it into one document, which human resources professionals call a “brag sheet,” DeMase said. If you’re making your request in writing, list those accomplishments when you ask for a raise. If the request is made in a conversation, you can use the list as talking points.\nBe sure to list any work or responsibilities that typically would not have been part of your job description. “Employers are wanting employees to do more with less, so we need to be documenting all of the ways in which we’re working outside of our job scope,” DeMase said.\nAlso take stock of the unique skills or traits you bring to the team.\n“People tend to overestimate our employers’ alternatives,” said Oakbay Consulting CEO Emily Epstein, who teaches negotiation courses at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley. “We assume they could just hire a long line of people, but it may be that we bring specialized expertise to our roles, something that would be hard to replace.”\nTiming matters\nDon’t seek a raise when your boss is hungry or at the end of a long day because the answer is more likely to be no, advises Epstein, whose company offers training on communication, conflict resolution and other business skills. If they’re well-rested and feeling great, you’re more likely to succeed, she said.\nGetting a raise is probably easier in booming fields, such as cybersecurity, while it could be a tough time to request one if you work in an industry that is shedding positions, Epstein said.\nBy the same token, waiting for the perfect time presents the risk of missing out on a chance to advocate for yourself.\n“You could wait your whole life for your boss to be well-rested or to have a lot of resources,” Epstein said. “So don’t wait forever.”\nResponding to “no”\nIf your request is denied, having made it can help set the stage for a future negotiation.\nAsk your manager what makes it difficult to say yes, Epstein suggested. “Is it the precedent you’d be establishing for this position that might be hard to live up to? Is it fairness to the other people in my position? Is it, right now the company’s struggling?” she said.\nAsk when you might revisit the conversation and whether you can get that timeframe in writing, DeMase said.\nLaura Kreller, an executive assistant at a university in Louisiana, recently earned a master’s degree and asked for her job description to change to reflect greater responsibilities and hopefully higher pay. Her boss was kind but turned her down, citing funding constraints. Kreller said she has no regrets.\n“I was proud of myself for doing it,” she said. “It’s better to know where you stand.”\n___\nShare your stories and questions about workplace wellness at [email protected].

    "body": "Presidente de Perú dice que no renunciará tras muerte de manifestante en protesta de Generación Z\nPresidente de Perú dice que no renunciará tras muerte de manifestante en protesta de Generación Z\nLIMA (AP) — El presidente peruano José Jerí afirmó el jueves que no renunciará tras la muerte de un manifestante la víspera a manos de un policía durante una protesta multitudinaria, en la cual se exigía su salida y la derogación de leyes que, según expertos, favorecen la delincuencia. Hubo 120 heridos.\n“Mi responsabilidad es mantener la estabilidad del país; esa es mi responsabilidad y mi compromiso”, declaró Jerí a la prensa local luego de asistir al Congreso, en el que dijo que pedirá facultades para legislar contra el crimen.\nEl jefe policial Óscar Arriola reveló a la prensa que el policía Luis Magallanes le disparó a un manifestante llamado Eduardo Ruiz, de 32 años, causándole la muerte. No respondió a preguntas sobre por qué el agente vestía de civil en medio de los manifestantes. Horas antes, el ministro del Interior, Vicente Tiburcio, dijo a la radio RPP que la policía no usó agentes vestidos de civil en la protesta.\nLas televisoras mostraron videos de Ruiz —un cantante de hip hop conocido como Truko— cuando cayó al piso en una calle de Lima luego de que el agente disparó mientras huía. Testigos indicaron que Magallanes escapaba porque los manifestantes descubrieron que era un policía infiltrado en la protesta.\nLas televisoras mostraron a hombres vestidos de civil que detenían a manifestantes y los introducían a la fuerza en carros policiales. Otro manifestante, Luis Reyes, de 28 años y también cantante de música urbana, sufrió fractura craneal, dijo a la prensa su tía Herli Rodríguez.\nLa Defensoría del Pueblo indicó que 88 policías y 32 civiles resultaron heridos. Entre los civiles había tres menores de edad, incluida una niña de 11 años que fue alcanzada por una bomba lacrimógena.\nPor la noche unas 200 personas prendieron velas en la calle donde murió el cantante de hip hop.\n“El país está cada vez peor... nos desangramos lentamente”, lamentó Sergio Trujillo, de 14 años, junto a cinco adolescentes miembros de la banda de rock escolar “Desmocional”, quienes llegaron en sus bicicletas a mirar el lugar donde Truko había fallecido. Las paredes de la calle donde el cantante murió tenían frases que decían: “Estado asesino”, y “policías sicarios del Estado”.\nManifestantes en Lima, entre los que había organizaciones autodenominadas Generación Z, quemaron el miércoles frente al Congreso un violín gigante de cartón cubierto por una banda presidencial y lanzaron fuegos artificiales a la policía, que respondió con gases lacrimógenos y perdigones. Televisoras mostraron al menos a una policía apuntando con su pistola a manifestantes que habían derribado su motocicleta.\nLas protestas evocaron para muchos peruanos el inicio del gobierno de Dina Boluarte, la antecesora de Jerí, que gobernó desde diciembre de 2022 pese a más de 500 protestas en su contra y 50 manifestantes muertos en los primeros meses de su gestión.\nBoluarte fue destituida el viernes luego de que los principales partidos en el Congreso le retiraron el apoyo cuando falta medio año para los comicios, en los que serán elegidos 130 diputados, 60 senadores y un nuevo presidente. Jerí, un legislador de 38 años que era el presidente del Parlamento, la reemplazó.\nLas críticas contra Jerí aumentaron porque enfrentó una investigación por presunta violación tras ser denunciado por una mujer. La fiscalía archivó la pesquisa en agosto, pero sigue activa para un hombre que acompañaba a Jerí el día en que habrían ocurrido los hechos. En la protesta más de 20 mujeres gritaban: “El violador es Jerí”.\nLos manifestantes también criticaron que, mientras fue legislador, Jerí votó a favor de seis leyes que, según expertos, debilitan la lucha contra la delincuencia. Esas normas eliminan la detención preliminar en casos sin flagrancia, impiden procesar a partidos políticos como grupos criminales, elevan los requisitos para confiscar bienes a grupos delictivos, y dificultan la colaboración eficaz y los allanamientos.\nPerú sufre un alza de la criminalidad, cuyas víctimas en su mayoría son de clase trabajadora. Los asesinatos subieron de 676 casos en 2017 hasta 2.082 en 2024, mientras que las denuncias por extorsiones aumentaron de 2.305 en 2020 a 21.746 en 2024, según datos de la fiscalía.\nLas manifestaciones de la Generación Z de Perú empezaron hace un mes y se llevaban a cabo los fines de semana. En un principio pretendían cambios en la ley de pensiones, que obligaba a los más jóvenes a realizar aportaciones, lo cual reducía aún más sus escasos ingresos.\nFinalmente, el Congreso anuló las aportaciones obligatorias para los jóvenes.",

The booster peeled away and made a controlled entry into the Gulf of Mexico as planned, with the spacecraft skimming space before descending into the Indian Ocean. Nothing was recovered.\n“Hey, welcome back to Earth, Starship,” SpaceX’s Dan Huot announced as employees cheered. “What a day.”\nIt was the 11th test flight for a full-scale Starship, which SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk intends to use to send people to Mars. NASA’s need is more immediate. The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade’s end without the 403-foot (123-meter) Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.\nInstead of remaining inside Launch Control as usual, Musk said that for the first time he was going outside to watch — “much more visceral.”\nThe previous test flight in August — a success after a string of explosive failures — followed a similar path with similar goals. More maneuvering was built in this time, especially for the spacecraft. SpaceX conducted a series of tests during the spacecraft’s entry over the Indian Ocean as practice for future landings back at the launch site.\nLike before, Starship carried up eight mock satellites mimicking SpaceX’s Starlinks. The entire flight lasted just over an hour, originating from Starbase near the Mexican border.\nNASA’s acting administrator Sean Duffy praised Starship’s progress. “Another major step toward landing Americans on the moon’s south pole,” he said via X.\nSpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships, in addition to the much smaller Falcon rockets used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A Nobel Prize winner didn’t\nBERLIN (AP) — For some Nobel Prize winners this year, the news came with a knock at the door before dawn. For others, it was a long-awaited phone call honoring a discovery made decades ago.\nOne of the medicine prize winners, meanwhile, was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park without cellular service. It would be hours before he found out.\nThe Nobel Prizes are considered among the world’s most prestigious honors for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, economics and peace. The winners join the pantheon of Nobel laureates, from Albert Einstein to Mother Teresa.\nSometimes, the award is anticipated. Potential winners plan tentative news conferences or, in the western U.S., wait up all night for the news.\nWhile some prizes might feature household names — such as 2009 peace prize winner then-U.S. President Barack Obama or 2016 literature laureate and singer-songwriter Bob Dylan — the natural science categories typically go to people whose names the general public doesn’t know, for decades-old research.\nFive of this year’s nine science winners were in the U.S. when the news broke. Some were fast asleep.\nTwo winners in Japan, seven hours ahead of Stockholm, were awake and working when the call came from a Swedish number. One thought it was a telemarketer.\nWednesday’s chemistry prize was the first time this year that the Nobel committee reached all three winners ahead of the formal announcement.\nHere’s how some of this year’s winners found out:\nA knock at the door\nWhen Associated Press photographer Lindsey Wasson knocked on the door of Mary E. Brunkow’s Seattle home around 4 a.m. local time Monday, it was the scientist’s dog who woke up first. Zelda’s barking roused Brunkow’s husband, Ross Colquhoun.\n“I don’t think he really knew what I was there for,” Wasson said. “And I said, ‘You know, sir, I think your wife just won the Nobel Prize.’”\nWasson’s photographs captured Colquhoun waking up Brunkow and telling her the life-changing news: She was among three winners sharing the 2025 medicine prize.\n“Don’t be ridiculous,” she told her husband.\nBut it was true. The trio had, in research dating back two decades, uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, called peripheral immune tolerance. Experts called the findings critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\nThe following day, AP photographers Mark J. Terrill and Damian Dovarganes headed to Santa Barbara, California, to find physicist John Martinis before the sun rose. His wife, Jean, answered the door and told them to come back later: Martinis needed to sleep.\n“For many years, we would stay up on the night the physics award was announced,” she told the photographers. “At some point we just decided, that’s nuts. We’ll figure it out if it’s happening, but let’s just get our sleep.”\nShe added, laughing: “I was trying to think how I can introduce this. Like, ‘Do you think you should plan a trip to Sweden?”\nShe finally woke her husband up just before 6 a.m. local time (1300 GMT), telling him only that the AP wanted an interview.\n“I kind of knew that the Nobel Prize announcements was this week, so I kind of put two and two together,” Martinis said later. “I opened my computer and looked under the Nobel Prize 2025 and saw my picture along with Michel Devoret and John Clarke. So I was kind of in shock.”\nThe trio won the physics prize for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.\nMartinis will get that trip to Sweden. The Dec. 10 award ceremony is in Stockholm.\nA hike interrupted\nEveryone but Fred Ramsdell seemed to know he had just won the Nobel Prize in medicine.\nRamsdell was away on a backpacking trip Monday, driving through Yellowstone National Park with his wife and two dogs, Larkin and Megan. He kept his cellphone in airplane mode as he often does on family trips.\nAs they drove through a small town hours later, his wife started screaming as notifications flooded her phone. She told him he’d just won the Nobel Prize in medicine alongside Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi.\n“I said, ‘No, I didn’t,’” Ramsdell told the AP in an interview the following day from his car. “She said, ‘Yes, you did. I have 200 text messages that say you won the Nobel Prize.’”\nLater Monday, Ramsdell drove to a Montana hotel to connect to Wi-Fi and call friends and colleagues. He didn’t speak with the Nobel committee to get their congratulations until midnight.\nHe said he was stunned and awed to receive the recognition. But he has no plans to change his phone habits, which he says are important for work-life balance.\nA phone call from Sweden\nThe Nobel Committee calls the winners shortly before the formal announcement is made. Some ignore the Swedish number — like Brunkow, who assumed the pre-dawn call was spam.\nWhen his phone rang Wednesday, chemistry winner Susumu Kitagawa was skeptical. He said he answered “rather bluntly, thinking it must be yet one of those telemarketing calls I’m getting a lot recently.”\n__\nRamakrishnan reported from New York.

    "body": "Nobel Prize in chemistry goes to discovery that could trap C02 and bring water to deserts\nNobel Prize in chemistry goes to discovery that could trap C02 and bring water to deserts\nSTOCKHOLM (AP) — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry Wednesday for their development of new molecular structures that can trap vast quantities of gas inside, laying the groundwork to potentially suck greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere or harvest moisture from desert environments.\nThe chairperson of the committee that made the award compared the structures called metal-organic frameworks to the seemingly bottomless magical handbag carried by Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” series. Another example might be Mary Poppins’ enchanted carpet bag. These containers look small from the outside but are able to hold surprisingly large quantities within.\nThe committee said Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi were honored for “groundbreaking discoveries” that “may contribute to solving some of humankind’s greatest challenges,” from pollution to water scarcity.\nRobson, 88, is affiliated with the University of Melbourne in Australia. Kitagawa, 74, is with Japan’s Kyoto University, and Yaghi, 60, is with the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe work that won the 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry\nThe chemists worked separately but added to each other’s breakthroughs over decades, beginning with Robson’s work in the 1980s.\nThe scientists were able to devise stable atomic structures that preserved holes of specific sizes that allowed gas or liquid to flow in and out. The holes can be customized to match the size of specific molecules that scientists or engineers want to hold in place, such as water, carbon dioxide or methane.\n“That level of control is quite rare in chemistry,” said Kim Jelfs, a computational chemist at Imperial College London. “It’s really efficient for storing gases.”\nA relatively small amount of the structure — which combines metal nodes and organic rods, somewhat like the interchangeable building pieces in Tinker Toys — creates many organized holes and a huge amount of surface area inside.\nFor instance, Jelfs said, a few grams of molecular organic framework may have as much surface area as a soccer field, all of which can be used to lock gas molecules in place.\n“If you can store toxic gases,” said American Chemical Society President Dorothy Phillips, “it can help address global challenges.”\nWhy the work matters\nToday researchers around the world are exploring possibilities that include using the frameworks to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and pollution from industrial sites. Another possibility is to use them to harvest moisture from desert air, perhaps to one day provide clean drinking water in arid environments.\nScientists are also investigating using the structures for targeted drug delivery. The idea is to load them with medicine that may be slowly released inside the body.\n“It could be a better way to deliver low doses continually,” as with cancer drugs, said David Pugh, a chemist at King’s College London.\nThe research “could be really, really valuable” in many industries, he said. But “there are still challenges when you translate that from the lab to the real world.” For example, many of the structures store the most gas and liquid in very low-temperature, high-pressure environments, he said.\nToday, metal-organic frameworks are already being used in some surprising ways, including as part of packing material to keep fruit fresh over long shipping routes, by gradually releasing chemicals that slow down the ripening process.\nThe winners’ reactions\nYaghi learned that he had won while traveling from San Francisco to Brussels. As he grabbed his luggage and prepared to change flights in Frankfurt, his phone started buzzing with a call from Sweden.\n“You cannot prepare for a moment like that,” he said at a news conference. ”The feeling is indescribable, but it’s absolutely thrilling.”\nWhen his phone rang, Kitagawa was at first skeptical. He said he answered “rather bluntly,” thinking it must be a telemarketing call.\n“It was such a big prize so I thought, ‘Is it really true?’” he recalled during a news conference at Kyoto University. “When one of the experts came on the phone and congratulated me, I finally thought it was real and felt relaxed.”\nKitagawa said the research has been widely recognized in the world of chemistry, but “it is very difficult to gain understanding by the ordinary people, and I’m delighted to be recognized.”\nThe 88-year-old Robson, in a phone call with The Associated Press from his home in Melbourne, Australia, said he was “very pleased of course and a bit stunned as well.”\n“This is a major thing that happens late in life when I’m not really in a condition to withstand it all,” he said. “But here we are.”\nNobel history and other 2025 prizes\nThe 2024 chemistry prize was awarded to David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, computer scientists at Google DeepMind, a British-American artificial intelligence research laboratory based in London.\nThe three were awarded for discovering powerful techniques to decode and even design novel proteins, the building blocks of life. Their work used advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and held the potential to transform how new drugs and other materials are made.\nThe first Nobel of 2025 was announced Monday. The prize in medicine went to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.\nTuesday’s physics prize went to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.\nThis year’s Nobel announcements continue with the literature prize Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics prize on Monday.\nThe award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.\n___\nDazio reported from Berlin, and Larson reported from Washington.

(AP) — The pumpkin in Tony Scott’s backyard weighs almost as much as a small car.\nHe’s been tending to it for months, feeding it fertilizer and covering it with a blanket at night to keep it at a stable temperature. A roll of measuring tape wrapped around the pumpkin gives him a rough estimate of its size.\n“I’ve never seen anything grow this fast,” said Scott, a semiconductor engineer from upstate New York.\nEvery year, growers like Scott push their pumpkins to the limit. They compete in annual weigh-offs with colossal fruits that are well over 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms). Scott’s pumpkin took third place this year, coming in at 1,931 pounds (876 kilograms).\nPumpkins aren’t the only crops that can get giant. Other members of the gourd family like squashes, cucumbers and watermelons are capable of a similar feat. But the orange behemoths are especially massive and have earned a place of honor at fall festivals and Halloween fairs.\nHow to grow a giant pumpkin\nA giant pumpkin starts off as the perfect seed. Growers choose seeds that have yielded large pumpkins in the past or test new ones. Scott and many other growers rely on the tried-and-true Atlantic Giant pumpkin seeds.\nAfter that, it comes down to the right combination of water, nutrients and care.\nGiant pumpkins can guzzle hundreds of gallons of water in a day and make their own food from sunlight just like regular-sized plants do. Their internal plumbing system is more robust, allowing them to drink up sugary water and nutrients faster.\nAs the leafy patch begins to expand, growers remove smaller pumpkins so all the water and nutrients funnel into a single fruit.\n“That helps make it extra big in a way that you might not see in the wild,” said Aleca Borsuk, a plant scientist at the New York Botanical Garden.\nBecause of gravity, giant pumpkins grow wide but not tall. They often resemble lopsided, lumpy pancakes. Scott’s pumpkin is also lighter in color because he covers it with a tarp during the day, protecting it from sunlight which can ripen and harden the skin. He waters it using an overhead sprinkler system.\nCan giant pumpkins grow forever?\n“The answer is no,” Borsuk said. No matter how big a pumpkin gets, it’ll eventually mature and its natural aging cycle will kick in.\nScott has nurtured giant pumpkins for eight years. It still blows his mind watching them inflate, putting on around 40 pounds to 50 pounds (18 kilograms to 23 kilograms) a day. He sets up reflective panels and even a fake wolf cutout to ward off hungry deer and other intruders looking for an orange-colored snack. Woodchucks have nibbled on the pumpkin’s vines in previous years.\nAfter the all-important weighing competition, Scott shows off the giant pumpkin at various themed events and drives it around on a trailer. Eventually, he donates it to be displayed or carved.\nOn the way to events, he often gets stopped by people who ask what he’s got in the back.\n“The first question they ask is, ‘Is it real?’” Scott said. “Where would you buy a fake pumpkin this big?”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

She called the local sheriff’s office and learned that NASA, indeed, was looking for a piece of equipment that had gone lost.\n“It’s crazy, because when you’re standing on the ground and see something in the air, you don’t realize how big it is,” she said. “It was probably a 30-foot parachute. It was huge.”\nWalter said she soon got a call from NASA’s Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility, which launches large unmanned, high altitude research balloons more than 20 miles into the atmosphere to conduct scientific experiments.\nOfficials at NASA, which is impacted by the ongoing government shutdown, did not return messages Thursday. A message left with the balloon facility also was not immediately returned.\nA launch schedule on the balloon facility’s website shows a series of launches from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of where the equipment landed.\nHale County Sheriff David Cochran confirmed that NASA officials called his office last week in search of the equipment.\nWalter said she ultimately spoke with someone at the balloon facility who told her it had been launched a day earlier from Fort Sumner, and uses telescopes to gather information about stars, galaxies and black holes.\n“The researchers came out with a truck and trailer they used to pick it up,” she said.\nBut not before Walter and her family, who live in Edmonson, Texas, were able to capture some photos and videos.\n“It’s kind of surreal that it happened to us and that I was part of it,” she said. “It was a very cool experience.”",

Here’s what to know\nNEW YORK (AP) — The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what’s known as a supermoon.\nOctober’s supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.\n“It’s not really very unusual,” said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.\nEveryone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment if clear skies permit. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven’t observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.\n“If you go out and just look at the moon when it’s very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,” Pitts said.\nIn the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles (361,459 kilometers) of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.\nThe spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "New study adds to the possibility of favorable conditions for life at Saturn’s moon Enceladus\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn’s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.\nTheir findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.\nWhile Enceladus may be habitable, no one is suggesting that life exists.\n“Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,” said the University of Washington’s Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.\nAn international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon’s geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn’s outermost rings.\nThese new grains collided with Cassini’s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.\nOrganic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.\nScientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon’s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.\nAn ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon’s jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.\n“We are confident that these molecules originate from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, enhancing its habitability potential,” the Free University of Berlin’s Nozair Khawaja, the lead author, said in an email.\nThe scientists favor new missions to further explore Enceladus. Launched in 1997, Cassini is long gone; the spacecraft was deliberately plunged into Saturn in 2017 following its joint mission by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.\n“Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,” Klenner said in an email.\nThe European Space Agency is in the early planning stages of a mission to land on Enceladus decades from now. China also has proposed a landing mission.\nNASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter’s moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that’s headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.\nUnderground oceans on moons “are perhaps the best candidates for the emergence of extraterrestrial life in our solar system. This work only confirms the need for further studies,” said University of Kent physics professor Nigel Mason, who was not involved in the latest findings.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Yet atop its circular pyramid, now surrounded by buildings and a shopping center, a pre-Hispanic fire god was revered.\n“This is incredible,” said Evangelina Báez, who spent a recent morning at Cuicuilco with her daughters. “In the midst of so much urbanization, there’s still this haven of peace.”\nHer visit was part of a monthly tour program crafted by the National Institute of Anthropology and History, known by its Spanish initials as INAH.\nAside from overseeing Mexico’s archaeological sites and museums, the institute safeguards the country’s cultural heritage, from restoring damaged monuments and artworks to reviewing construction projects to ensure they don’t harm archaeological remains.\nIts historians and archeologists also lead excursions like the one in Cuicuilco. Each academic expert picks a location, proposes a walking itinerary to the INAH and, once approved, it’s offered to the public for about 260 pesos ($15).\n“I joined these tours with the intention of sharing our living heritage,” said archaeologist Denisse Gómez after greeting guests in Cuicuilco. “Our content is always up to date.”\nAccording to Mónica de Alba, who oversees the tours, the INAH excursions date back to 1957, when an archaeologist decided to share the institute’s research with colleagues and students.\n“People are beginning to realize how much the city has to offer,” said De Alba, explaining that the INAH offers around 130 tours per year in downtown Mexico City alone. “There are even travel agents who pretend to be participants to copy our routes.”\nMaría Luisa Maya, 77, often joins these tours as a solo visitor. Her favorite so far was one to an archaeological site in Guerrero, a southern Mexican state along the Pacific coast.\n“I’ve been doing this for about eight years,” she said. “But that’s nothing. I’ve met people who have come for 20 or 25.”\nTraces of a lost city\nCuicuilco means “the place where songs and dances are made” in the Nahua language.\nStill, the precise name of its people is unknown, given that the city’s splendor dates back to the pre-Classic era from 400 to 200 B.C. and few clues are left to dig deeper into its history.\n“The Nahuas gave them that name, which reveals that this area was never forgotten,” said archaeologist Pablo Martínez, who co-led the visit with Gómez. “It was always remembered, and even after its decline, the Teotihuacan people came here to make offerings.”\nThe archaeological site is a quiet corner nestled between two of Mexico City’s busiest avenues. Yet according to Martínez, the settlements went far beyond the vicinity and Cuicuilco’s population reached 40,000.\n“What we see today is just a small part of the city,” he said. “Merely its pyramidal base.”\nNow covered in grass and resembling a truncated cone, the pyramid was used for ritual purposes. The details of the ceremonies are unknown, but female figurines preserved at the site’s museum suggest that offerings were related to fertility.\n“We think they offered perishable objects such as corn, flowers and seeds,” Gómez said. “They were feeding the gods.”\nEchoes of living heritage\nAccording to official records, Mexico’s most visited archaeological sites are Teotihuacán and Chichén Itzá. The first is a pre-Aztec city northeast of the capital known for its monumental Sun and Moon pyramids. The latter is a major Mayan site in the Southeast famed for its 12th-century Temple of Kukulkán.\nThe INAH oversees both. But its tours focus on shedding light on Mexico’s hidden gems.\nDuring an excursion preceding Cuicuilco’s, visitors walked through a neighborhood in Ecatepec, on the outskirts of Mexico City, where open-air markets, street food and religious festivals keep local traditions alive. A few days prior, another tour focused on La Merced market, where flowers, prayers and music filled the aisles during the feast of Our Lady of Mercy.\nOctober’s schedule takes into account Day of the Dead traditions. But tours will feature a variety of places like Xochimilco, where visitors can take a moonlit boat tour through its canals and chinampas, and Templo Mayor, the Aztec empire’s main religious and social center in ancient Tenochtitlán.\n“These tours allow the general public to get closer to societies that are distant in time and space,” said historian Jesús López del Río, who will lead an upcoming tour on human sacrifices to deities in Mesoamérica.\n“Approaching the pre-Hispanic past is not only about how the Maya used zero in their calculations or how the Mexica built a city on a lake,” he added. “It’s about understanding how those societies worked — their way of seeing and relating to the world.”\n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Webb and others began scouring museum files and gathered almost 300 photos to create a visual archive of the Yazidi people, one of Iraq’s oldest religious minorities.\nThe systematic attacks, which the United Nations called a genocide, killed thousands of Yazidis and sent thousands more into exile or sexual slavery. It also destroyed much of their built heritage and cultural history, and the small community has since become splintered around the world.\nAnsam Basher, now a teacher in England, was overwhelmed with emotion when she saw the photos, particularly a batch from her grandparents’ wedding day in the early 1930s.\n“No one would imagine that a person my age would lose their history because of the ISIS attack,” said the 43-year-old, using an acronym for the extremist group. Basher’s grandfather lived with her family while she was growing up in Bashiqa, a town outside Mosul. The city fell to IS in 2014.\n“My albums, my childhood photos, all videos, my two brothers’ wedding videos (and) photos, disappeared. And now to see that my grandfather and great-grandfather’s photo all of a sudden just come to life again, this is something I’m really happy about,” she said. “Everybody is.”\nA cache of cultural memory\nThe archive documents Yazidi people, places and traditions that IS sought to erase. Marin Webb is working with Nathaniel Brunt, a Toronto documentarian, to share it with the community, both through exhibits in the region and in digital form with the Yazidi diaspora.\n“When they came to Sinjar, they went around and destroyed all the religious and heritage sites, so these photographs in themselves present a very strong resistance against that act of destruction,” said Brunt, a postdoctoral student at the University of Victoria Libraries. The city of Sinjar is the ancestral homeland of the Yazidis near the Syrian border.\nThe first exhibits took place in the region in April, when Yazidis gather to celebrate the New Year. Some were held outdoors in the very areas the photos documented nearly a century earlier.\n“(It) was perceived as a beautiful way to bring memory back, a memory that was directly threatened through the ethnic cleansing campaign,” Marin Webb said.\nBasher’s brother was visiting their hometown from Germany when he saw the exhibit and recognized his grandparents. That helped the researchers fill in some blanks.\nThe wedding photos show an elaborately dressed bride as she stands anxiously in the doorway of her home, proceeds with her dowry to her husband’s village, and finally enters his family home as a crowd looks on.\n“I see my sister in black and white,” said Basher, noting the similar green eyes and skin tone her sister shares with their grandmother, Naama Sulayman.\nHer grandfather, Bashir Sadiq Rashid al-Rashidani, came from a prominent family and often hosted the Penn archaeology crews at his cafe. He and his brother, like other local men, also worked on the excavations, prompting him to invite the westerners to his wedding. They in turn took the photos and even lent the couple a car for the occasion, the family said.\nSome of the photos were taken by Ephraim Avigdor Speiser, the Penn Museum archaeologist who led excavations at two ancient Mesopotamian sites in the area, Tepe Gawra and Tell Billa.\n“My grandfather used to talk a lot about that time,” said Basher, who uses a different spelling of the family surname than other relatives.\nHer father, Mohsin Bashir Sadiq, 77, a retired teacher now living in Cologne, Germany, believes the wedding was the first time anyone in the town used a car, which he described as a 1927 model. It can be seen at the back of the wedding procession.\nBasher has shared the photos on social media to educate people about her homeland.\n“The idea or the picture they have in their mind about Iraq is so different from the reality, ” she said. “We’ve been suffering a lot, but we still have some history.”\nFound photos, history awakened\nOther photos in the collection show people at home, at work, at religious gatherings.\nTo Marin Webb, an architect from Barcelona, they show the Yazidis as they lived, instead of equating them with the violence they later endured. Locals who saw the exhibit told him it “shows the world that we’re also people.”\nAn isolated minority, the Yazidis have been persecuted for centuries.\nBasher is grateful the photos remained safe — if largely out of sight — at the museum all this time. Alessandro Pezzati, the museum’s senior archivist, was one of several people who helped Marin Webb comb through the files to identify them.\n“A lot of these collections are sleeping until they get woken up by people like him,” Pezzati said.",

(AP/Cesar Barreto)\nLIMA, Peru (AP) — Utility workers excavating trenches to expand underground gas networks in Peru’s capital unearthed two pre-Incan tombs on Thursday. One was empty, but the other held the 1,000-year-old remains of an individual, alongside four clay vessels and three pumpkin shell artifacts.\nThis isn’t the first time Cálidda, the company that distributes natural gas in Lima, has found archaeological remains. Over more than two decades of excavation work to expand the underground network, the company says it has made more than 2,200 discoveries.\nAccording to archaeologist José Aliaga, the vessels’ iconography and their black, white, and red colors “allow us to establish a connection with the pre-Incan Chancay culture,’ which is approximately 1,000 to 1,470 years old.” Aliaga told The Associated Press that the individual was found wrapped in a torn bundle, in a sitting position with his legs against his chest, and his team will continue cleaning the remains.\n“Lima is unique among Latin American capitals,” Aliaga said, “in that various archaeological finds are unearthed during nearly every civil project.”\nThe Peruvian capital, a city of 10 million people, has more than 400 archaeological sites from the Inca era, the 15th century, or earlier, from the pre-Inca period, according to the Ministry of Culture.\nOn Thursday, passersby stopped in their tracks to observe the burial site, even taking out their cellphones to take a picture.\n“I always thought they were paths where no one had lived,” said Flor Prieto, who was walking with her 7-year-old daughter. “But now I know that people older than the Incas have lived there…it feels so exciting.”\n“It is very common to find archaeological remains on the Peruvian coast, including Lima, mainly funerary elements: tombs, burials, and, among these, mummified individuals,” said Pieter Van Dalen, dean of the College of Archaeologists of Peru. Van Dalen was not involved in Thursday’s discovery.\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "body": "A 100,000-year-old burial site in Israel is changing what we know about early humans\nSHOHAM, Israel (AP) — Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.\nThe findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.\nOf particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.\n“This is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,” said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. “It’s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.”\nArchaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.\nThe skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.\nThese objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.\nA window into early human burials\nTinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel’s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls “one of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.”\nThe Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.\nSome of the Tinshemet researchers’ core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature — evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.\n“Here we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,” Zaidner said.\nUsing hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.\nAt the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.\nTinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.\nThe skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel’s acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.\nA window into a little-known period\nTryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating to the same period in northern Israel — Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.\n“There were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it’s a pattern we know, and they’re really nailing down the dates,” Tryon said.\nTinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.\nSome archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species — an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens — may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.\nA bridge between peoples\nIn ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.\nExperts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it’s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.\nThe mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It’s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between “us” and “them,” he said.\nIsrael Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes “a kind of a territory.”\nHe said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. “It’s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying ’This is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather’ and so on and so on.”",

    "body": "Scientists search for DNA of an endangered salamander in Mexico City’s canals\nMEXICO CITY (AP) — Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls — the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon — out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it’s almost impossible to find them in the wild.\nThat’s why scientists from Mexico’s National Autonomous University are filtering Xochimilco’s murky waters for traces of the endangered creature’s DNA.\n“We all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,” said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university’s ecological restoration lab.\nAs they try to monitor the axolotls’ dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.\nThey sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That’s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.\nScientists collected water from 53 locations in Xochimilco: 10 inside refuges where water is filtered and the water is cleaner and 43 outside those areas. They found axolotl DNA inside the protected areas and in one site outside them.\nReferring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said “it’s very little,” but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals.\nSo far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year.\nThe trend, however, is not good. From an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in 1998, there were only 36 per square kilometer in the last census, in 2014.\nZambrano highlights that his team’s work has shown that conservation works and that the effort to protect the species is also improving water quality, increasing the number of pollinizers in the area and means that Mexico City makes better use of Xochimilco’s water, among other benefits.\nBut policymakers can do more, he said, such as prohibiting the opening of dance clubs, spas and soccer fields on Xochimilco’s traditional man-made islands, known as chinampas. Instead, the government should incentivize the islands’ traditional agricultural production, ensuring that farmers can actually make a living at it.\nIf its habitat is fixed, the axolotl can take care of the rest.\n“The axolotl reproduces a lot because it lays a lot of eggs … it can easily recover and we know how,” Zambrano said.\n___\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "body": "Healthy babies born in Britain after scientists used DNA from three people to avoid genetic disease\nHealthy babies born in Britain after scientists used DNA from three people to avoid genetic disease\nLONDON (AP) — Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.\nMost DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it’s that genetic material — some inherited from mom, some from dad — that makes us who we are. But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.\nTesting during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.\nResearchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.\nThe latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”\nUsing this method means the embryo has DNA from three people — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.\nExperts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.\nOne of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.\nDr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work “a triumph of scientific innovation,” and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.\nLovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.\n“If you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor … you will have much more DNA from another person,” he said.\nIn the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country’s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.\nCritics have previously raised concerns, warning that it’s impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.\n“Currently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,” Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.”\nFor about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”\nBut in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.\nLiz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.\nShe said the diagnosis “turned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.” Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter’s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.\n“It’s super exciting for families that don’t have much hope in their lives,” Curtis said.\n___\nUngar reported from Erie, Pennsylvania.\n——-\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The findings were published Wednesday in Nature.\nThe hooked claws are a crucial identification clue, said study co-author and paleontologist Per Ahlberg at Uppsala University in Sweden.\n“It’s a walking animal,” he said.\nOnly animals that evolved to live solely on land ever developed claws. The earliest vertebrates -- fish and amphibians – never developed hard nails and remained dependent on watery environments to lay eggs and reproduce.\nBut the branch of the evolutionary tree that led to modern reptiles, birds and mammals – known as amniotes -- developed feet with nails or claws fit for walking on hard ground.\n“This is the earliest evidence we’ve ever seen of an animal with claws,” said Sumida.\nAt the time the ancient reptile lived, the region was hot and steamy and vast forests began to cover the planet. Australia was part of the supercontinent Gondwana.\nThe fossil footprints record a series of events in one day, Ahlberg said. One reptile scampered across the ground before a light rain fell. Some raindrop dimples partially obscured its trackways. Then two more reptiles ran by in the opposite direction before the ground hardened and was covered in sediment.\nFossil “trackways are beautiful because they tell you how something lived, not just what something looked like,” said co-author John Long, a paleontologist at Flinders University in Australia.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "The Asian elephant population in Cambodia is more robust than previously thought, a study finds\nThe Asian elephant population in Cambodia is more robust than previously thought, a study finds\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A genetic study of Asian elephants in northern Cambodia published Thursday reveals a larger and more robust population than previously thought, raising hopes the endangered species could slowly recover.\nResearchers from the Fauna & Flora conservation group collected samples from elephant dung in Cambodia’s northern plains and extracted DNA. From the DNA they were able to identify individual elephants, estimate population size, and determine the sex of the animals and the overall genetic diversity of the population.\nFrom their work they estimated that there are 51 elephants in the Prey Lang, Preah Roka, and Chhaeb Wildlife Sanctuaries, with greater genetic diversity — a “critical factor for long-term viability,” the researchers said — than in two other areas of the country in which they live.\n“With sufficient suitable habitat remaining in the region, the population has the potential to grow if properly protected,” the report concludes.\nOverall, some 400 to 600 Asian elephants are believed to remain living in the wild in Cambodia. Researchers said the study’s findings underscore the potential of the northern area studied to become a “national stronghold” for them, contributing to Cambodia’s biodiversity conservation goals.\n“Habitat degradation, especially when it leads to fragmentation, continues to be a serious concern,” Pablo Sinovas, director of Fauna & Flora in Cambodia, told The Associated Press.\n“This study provides a robust basis on which to base conservation efforts and landscape management.”\nThe study, supported by USAID funds and Britain’s People’s Postcode Lottery, was conducted in collaboration with the Cambodian Environment Ministry. The genetic testing was done at the Royal University of Phnom Penh with technical support from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland.\nThe research was carried out in the 2020-21 dry season, but Sinovas said since elephants reproduce slowly it is not thought that the population size would have changed significantly since then.\nResearchers want to replicate the study elsewhere in Cambodia and in other countries, such as neighboring Vietnam where the Asian elephants live in fragmented populations.\n“We were very pleasantly surprised by the results of the project,” said Alex Ball, conservation manager for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland.\n“We now hope to expand this methodology across Cambodia and beyond, helping to build a clearer picture of Asian elephant numbers, which will inform how best we can work to help reverse the decline of these spectacular animals.”\n____\nRising reported from Bangkok",

While some animal populations continue to decline, green sea turtles are showing signs of recovery. (AP Video/Cody Jackson)\nArctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nOne bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.\nWhile many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.\n“Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,” Jabado wrote by email. “The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions — supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.”\nThe list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn’t involved with the IUCN report.\n“Every time one is done and every time there’s revision, there’s more information, and there’s more ability to answer questions” on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.\nSea ice loss\nBecause all the marine mammals native to the Arctic — seals, whales and polar bears — rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they’re all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.\nThe three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report — harp, hooded and bearded seals — have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.\nThe same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also “generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,” wrote Kovacs.\n“Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,” Kovacs said.\nGlobal bird decline\nThe update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel’s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.\nDeforestation of tropical forests is one of a “depressing litany of threats” to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.\n“The fact that 61% of the world’s birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can’t afford to ignore,” Butchart said.\nThe annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was “not so confident” that world’s leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.\n“I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,” he said. “But it’s not easy.”\nGreen sea turtles\nOne success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world’s oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.\nStill, “it’s important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,” said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn’t involved with the IUCN report.\nThe overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren’t doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.\nAnd even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.\nBut in the places where they have recovered, it’s “a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,” Pilcher said. “We can. We can make a difference.”\n___\nFollow Melina Walling on X at @MelinaWalling and on Bluesky at @melinawalling.bsky.social.\n___\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "Trump administration wants to cancel Biden-era rule that made conservation a ‘use’ of public land\nTrump administration wants to cancel Biden-era rule that made conservation a ‘use’ of public land\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on Wednesday proposed canceling a public land management rule that put conservation on equal footing with development, as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to open more taxpayer-owned tracts to drilling, logging, mining and grazing.\nThe rule was a key part of efforts under former President Joe Biden to refocus the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management, which oversees about 10% of land in the U.S. Adopted last year, it allowed public property to be leased for restoration in the same way that oil companies lease land for drilling.\nIndustry and agriculture groups were bitterly opposed to the Biden rule and lobbied Republicans to reverse it. States including North Dakota, where Burgum served as governor before joining Trump’s Cabinet, pursued a lawsuit hoping to block the rule.\nWednesday’s announcement comes amid a flurry of actions since Trump took office aimed at boosting energy production from the federal government’s vast land holdings, which are concentrated in Western states including Alaska, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.\nInterior officials said the Biden rule sidelined people who depend on public lands for their livelihoods and imposed unneeded restrictions. No conservation leases had been issued under the new rule, they said.\nBurgum said in a statement that it could have blocked energy and mineral production, logging, grazing and recreation across hundreds of thousands of acres. Overturning the rule “protects our American way of life and gives our communities a voice in the land that they depend on,” Burgum said.\nEnvironmentalists had largely embraced the rule finalized in April 2024. Supporters argued that conservation was a long-neglected facet of the land bureau’s mission under the 1976 Federal Lands Policy Management Act.\n“The administration cannot simply overthrow that statutory authority because they would prefer to let drilling and mining companies call the shots,” said Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society.\nWhile the bureau previously issued leases for conservation purposes in limited cases, it never had a dedicated program for it.\nCritics said the change under Biden violated the “multiple use” mandate for Interior Department lands, by catapulting the “non-use” of federal lands — meaning restoration leases — to a position of prominence.\nNational Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan said Burgum’s proposal would ensure the nation’s natural resources are available to address rising energy demands and supply important minerals.\n“This is a welcome change from the prior clear disregard for the legal obligation to balance multiple uses on federal lands,” Nolan said.\nThe rule also promoted the designation of more “areas of critical environmental concern” — a special status that can restrict development. It’s given to land with historic or cultural significance or that’s important for wildlife conservation.\nIn addition to its surface land holdings, the land bureau regulates publicly-owned underground mineral reserves — such as coal for power plants and lithium for renewable energy — across more than 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers). The bureau has a history of industry-friendly policies and for more than a century has sold grazing permits and oil and gas leases.\nThe pending publication of Burgum’s proposal will kick off a 60-day public comment period.\nHouse Republicans last week repealed land management plans adopted in the closing days of former President Joe Biden’s administration that restricted development in large areas of Alaska, Montana and North Dakota. Interior officials also announced a proposal aimed at increasing mining and drilling in Western states with populations of greater sage grouse. Biden administration officials proposed limits on development and prohibitions against mining to help protect the grouse.",

(AP) — Until this week, a company with zoning approval in Tucson could have relatively unlimited access to Tucson’s water system, even if it was going to use millions of gallons of water.\nNow, with the unanimous passage of a new ordinance by the city council, any large water user that wants to gain access to Tucson’s water will have to apply to the city and show its water conservation efforts.\nThe goal, said Mayor Regina Romero, was to protect the city from large water users like data centers as quickly as possible. “Approving this tonight will help protect us immediately,” Romero said Tuesday.\nThe ordinance comes after weeks of a heady and impassioned debate over Project Blue, a massive and secretive data center proposal that could have used hundreds of millions of gallons of water a year.\nTo get those gallons, the project had to be annexed into Tucson — a step that also brought its massive water use before the Tucson City Council for review.\nDevelopers promised a “water positive” project, but information about the full scale of the data center as well as its final user were not shared by public officials or the company.\nPublic outrage fueled by the secrecy and concerns over large water use pushed city council members to reject the annexation proposal at the council’s last study session in August.\nNow the new ordinance addresses some of those concerns. It lays out what large water users must include in an application to access Tucson water, as well as instances in which water service could be suspended. It also requires city council approval of an initial application, and makes all application materials public records.\nTucson’s ordinance passed Tuesday doesn’t go as far as some nearby localities.\nMarana, Arizona amended its zoning code in 2024 to include language around data centers.\nThat language says Marana will not provide potable water to a data center for cooling, humidity control or other similar operations. Any data center applications must include an estimate of annual water consumption for the site, and the intended source of water.\nProject Blue proposed using potable water from Tucson for the first several years of the project.\nMichael Bogan, a professor and biologist at the University of Arizona who is a water resources researcher, told Arizona Luminaria ahead of the meeting that he welcomed an ordinance that would require public review of new and expanding large water users in Tucson.\nHe was concerned, however, that the large water user ordinance would only partially protect Tucson from the environmental harms of a future data center. “The proposed regulation is insufficient for data centers,” he said.\nA wave of reform\nThe Pima County Board of Supervisors voted Monday to initiate a process to potentially add zoning restrictions on large-scale industrial users, with a specific intent to add guardrails to any data center that wants to build in the region.\nIf implemented, the new process would require additional public engagement and official review. Supervisor Jen Allen, of District 3, who introduced the measure, said it was important to work in tandem with the city of Tucson as they begin their own process of establishing a more thorough review process for proposed data centers.\nAllen also said that other jurisdictions in Arizona and across the country have already imposed similar guidelines. Allen said “30 or more” data centers have their sights on Pima County.\nTucson’s ordinance is also not the last word on the large water user rules. The ordinance would then be subject to a six-month public review period, including from the Citizen Water Advisory Committee, to consider adjustments, said Ward 6 council member Karin Uhlich in her newsletter.\nOrganizers with No Desert Data Center, the group that sprung up quickly and led the public protest against the proposed data center, said they are eager to participate in the public process around the water ordinance but also hoped to see action on stopping power projects until more rules were developed.\n“We are encouraged to see Mayor and Council quickly take the necessary step to make sure another large quantity water user won’t be able to connect to Tucson Water without approval,” a statement from the group before the meeting said. “While that’s happening, we would prefer a stronger interim ordinance, like a stop to all large quantity water AND power projects… We all want more jobs for Tucsonans, and together, we can figure out how to make growth sustainable.”\nWard 3 council member Kevin Dahl, who came out early against the data center, said he specifically wanted to bring the No Desert Data Center coalition and the Watershed Management Group into the conversation.\nOther speakers on Monday spoke against data centers more broadly.\nLiah Caldwell, a resident of Ward 5, said she was proud and encouraged by the city council vote but said this was only the first step to protect water in Tucson. “I am acutely aware that this is a temporary reprieve to protect our limited and most precious resource,” she said. Caldwell added that her own family has seen the consequences of contamination, saying her grandfather’s death was linked to PFAS chemicals from firefighting foam used at the Arizona Air National Guard base and Davis Monthan Air Force Base.\nDetails of the ordinance\nThe ordinance adds new provisions to the city code for large water users that want to connect to Tucson’s water supply, whether they are a new customer or a current one planning to use more water.\nTo connect to the city’s water system a user must submit a water service application with a water conservation plan to the Tucson Water director if they expect to use more than 7.4 million gallons of water a month. That counts for new users, or existing Tucson Water customers.\nAccording to city documents, currently no single Tucson Water customer uses this amount of water on an average monthly basis — some golf courses connected to the reclaimed water system may use that much in a year. The average Tucson customer uses 126 gallons a day, according to an analysis from Making Action Possible Southern Arizona.\nThat water conservation plan must:\n1. Be submitted at the same time an applicant submits any development requests or water-meter upsizing. That application must also include the phases of construction, and the approximate number and size of structures that will be served\n2. Have a description of the nature and type of water use and “a reasonable estimate of the projected annual, monthly, and daily water demand”\n3. Include techniques and technologies that will reduce the consumption of water, reduce the loss or waste of water or improve the efficiency in the use of water\n4. If the location is within one mile of the Tucson Water Reclaimed Water Distribution System, the plan should include information about the cost of a connection to the Reclaimed Water Distribution System\nAll of those applications will also be public record, the ordinance says.\nAny water service applications and water conservation plans from large water users will also be reviewed during regular city council meetings if the Tucson Water director believes the applicant’s water use has enough economic benefit that is consistent with the city’s economic development plans.\nFor ongoing oversight, the ordinance says:\n5. The user must submit an updated water conservation plan to the Tucson Water director every five years\n6. The director of Tucson Water has final discretion on whether the updated water conservation plan shows the user utilizing water as effectively as possible.\n7. The user is prohibited from using water in excess of 120% of the amount set out in their water service application\nIf the user accessing Tucson’s water violates any part of the agreement, the possible sanctions are:\n8. For a first violation that took place for less than a year, the water user must pay 200% of the monthly charges for water used\n9. For a second violation that took place for more than a year but less than two years, the water user must pay 500% of the monthly charges for water used\n10. For a third violation that took place for more than two years but less than three, the water user must pay 1000% of the monthly charges for water used\n11. For a fourth violation that took place for more than three years, the water user must pay 2000% of the monthly charges for water used\n12. After that, Tucson Water could install a water restricting device, at the applicant’s cost, or suspend water access entirely\nTucson Water also said it will not collect fees for the applications or adopt new rates for large water users as part of the ordinance.\nA history of water stewardship\nTucson was one of the first U.S. cities to start a large-scale water reclamation program that uses treated wastewater for parks, schools and golf courses, said a city council communication on the large water user ordinance.\nThat has kept water use about the same as it was in the late 1980s, even though Tucson Water now serves 200,000 more people.\nBogan, of the University of Arizona, said Tucson has been a leader in its water policy for more than three decades. In his experience, the data center response was one of the first times Tucson was playing catch up on water policy.\nWard 4 council member Nikki Lee said she didn’t know about the vulnerability in Tucson’s city codes until she heard about a bottling plant that wanted to do business in her ward and would have unlimited water access. “That was a huge catalyst for me,” she said Tuesday.\nWhat Bogan would like to hear in the ongoing process reviewing the large water user ordinance is how city officials will consult tribal communities. In particular, Bogan said, the Pascua Yaqui Tribe relies on Tucson Water to provide water for its community. The tribe is one among many in Arizona that has an ongoing dispute with the state over water access.\n___\nArizona Luminaria reporter John Washington contributed reporting for this story\n___\nThis story was originally published by the Arizona Luminaria and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

    "body": "Krill fishery in Antarctica shut down after record catch triggers unprecedented early closure\nMIAMI (AP) — Officials have shut down early the remote krill fishery near Antarctica after trawling for the tiny crustacean — a vital food source for whales that also helps fight climate change — exceeded the seasonal catch limit for the first time.\nThe unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world’s southernmost fishery.\nThe Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit.\nThe U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.\nIn the absence of a deal, industrial trawlers were allowed this season to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales, penguins and seals. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last season’s haul, according to an internal CCAMLR report obtained by the AP.\nKrill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill’s Omega-3 rich oil – for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements — have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill — until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.\nUnderscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.\nKrill aren’t just vital to marine ecosystems. Increasingly, researchers are focusing on their role as a bulwark against climate change. One peer-reviewed study found that krill remove from the atmosphere and store in the ocean 20 million tons of carbon annually. That’s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year.\n—\nThis story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

    "body": "Eating less meat would be good for the Earth. Small nudges can change behavior\nEating less meat would be good for the Earth. Small nudges can change behavior\nNEW YORK (AP) — Preston Cabral eats meat nearly every day at home, but his favorite meals at school are served on “Meatless Mondays” and “Vegan Fridays.”\n“Today I ate chips, tangerines and this thing that looked like chili but without the meat — just beans,” the 12-year-old said after lunch on a Friday at I.S. 318 Eugenio Maria De Hostos.\nThe Monday and Friday lunches have inspired Preston’s family to make more vegetarian meals at home, sparking what experts say is a healthy shift for them — and for the planet.\nPrograms like these are among the few proven to work for one of the thorniest problems of the 21st century: How to get people to eat less meat.\n___\nEDITORS’ NOTE — This story is part of The Protein Problem, an AP series that examines the question: Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet?\n___\nA new poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that most U.S. adults said they eat meat at least several times each week. About two-thirds (64%) said they eat chicken or turkey that often, and 43% eat beef that frequently.\nBut experts agree that the urgency of climate change and the demands of a surging global population call for an overhaul of how humans get their protein.\n“There has arguably never been a more important time in human history to transform our food system for the sake of humans and nature,” a coalition of United Kingdom climate scientists concluded in a 2020 analysis.\nThat will require changing consumer behavior around meat, particularly in rich countries, experts said. From a health perspective, people in places like the U.S., Canada and Europe eat far more meat, especially red meat and processed meat, than recommended. That puts them at risk for obesity, heart disease, stroke and other problems plaguing wealthy nations.\nScientists say the average U.S. adult consumes about 100 grams of protein, mostly meat, each day — about twice the recommended amount. That adds up to more than 328 pounds of meat per person each year, including 58 pounds of poultry, 37 pounds of beef, 30 pounds of pork and 22 pounds of fish and seafood, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.\nAt the same time, meat production is a key driver of climate change. The livestock sector is responsible for at least 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is the single greatest source of methane, a top threat to Earth’s climate, according to the Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations.\nThere’s no question that cutting back on meat consumption could have real and lasting effects.\nResearchers at the University of Oxford recently reported that vegans have 30% of the dietary environmental impact as people who eat high amounts of meat. Vegans produced 25% of greenhouse gas emissions and land use impact, 46% of water use, 27% of water pollution and 34% of the impact on biodiversity than the top meat-eaters.\nSignificantly, even low-meat diets contributed only about 70% of the environmental impact of high-meat diets, wrote Keren Papier, a co-author of the study.\n“You don’t have to go full vegan or even vegetarian to make a big difference,” Papier said.\nYounger people could be key. They may be open to new ways of eating because they’re more aware of climate change and the environmental costs of our current eating patterns, said Dr. Martin Bloem, an environmental health professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nBut he’s worried about the pace of change: “I think it goes too slow.”\nChanging human behavior, especially regarding something as important and intimate as the food we eat, is challenging, no matter a person’s age.\nEating meat is an ingrained, habitual part of daily life in most parts of the world, said Julia Wolfson, who studies nutrition at Johns Hopkins University. Meat consumption is “orders of magnitude higher” in the U.S. than in low-income countries, and meals are often centered around it. She recalled a well-known advertisement from the mid-1990s that resonated across the country: “Beef: It’s What’s for Dinner.”\nBesides its central role in U.S. and other cultures, there are firm perceptions that meat is necessary, especially for “young boys to grow up healthy and strong,” she said.\nAt the same time, research shows most people are reluctant to even learn about the negative impacts of eating meat and they’re stymied by the so-called “meat paradox.” That’s the term scientists use to describe the psychological conflict that occurs in people who like to eat meat but don’t like to contemplate the animals that died providing it.\nThe AP-NORC poll illustrates that conundrum.\nAbout 8 in 10 U.S. adults said taste was an extremely or very important factor when buying food, with its cost and nutritional value following close behind. Americans are much less likely to prioritize the food’s effect on the environment (34%) or its effect on animal welfare (30%).\nDespite those hurdles, certain interventions can cut meat consumption, research shows.\nStressing the connection between meat and animals seems to work. For instance, experiments that displayed photos of meat dishes on restaurant menus alongside pictures of the animals that they came from have consistently proven to reduce meat consumption, according to researchers at Stanford University.\nAnother strategy is to emphasize animal welfare. Research subjects exposed to information about it are more likely than control groups to buy or eat less meat or to say they intended to eat less meat, studies show.\nInterventions described as “nudges,” or small choices aimed at influencing behavior, appear to be among the most effective at cutting meat consumption. Many are designed to help make healthy choices more convenient.\nThey can be as simple as decreasing portion sizes of meat and boosting veggies at home and in restaurants. Or they can involve positioning vegetarian offerings more prominently in grocery stores and buffet lines. In a 2021 study in the Journal of Public Health, vegetarian choices surged from as low as 2% to nearly 90% when researchers made non-meat meals the default option on conference menus.\nSome nations are mulling more drastic measures. In the Netherlands, the agriculture minister proposed introducing a tax on meat, an idea that is still being debated. The city of Haarlem, outside of Amsterdam, is set to ban advertising of “industrialized meat” in public spaces starting in 2025.\nThose options wouldn’t go over well in the U.S., according to the AP-NORC poll. About 7 in 10 U.S. adults said they would somewhat or strongly oppose raising taxes on the sale of meat and 43% would oppose banning public advertising for meat on government property.\nMeanwhile, meat-free menu days are becoming more common, with Meatless Monday programs taking root around the world.\n“Meatless Monday has had a lot of success in raising awareness and starting a conversation just about small changes that one can make that make it seem not overwhelming to people,” Wolfson said.\nIt seems to be working at Preston Cabral’s school. Ricardo Morales, a cook ambassador, said more kids get school lunch on Fridays than any other day of the week.\n“Vegan day is just the biggest day we serve right now,” he said. “It’s bigger than hamburger and even pizza day.”\n___\nThe poll of 1,247 adults was conducted Feb. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

    "body": "Goodall’s influence spread far and wide. Those who felt it are pledging to continue her work\nGoodall’s influence spread far and wide. Those who felt it are pledging to continue her work\nIn her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity’s understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet — chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.\nHer death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall’s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.\nMaking space in science for animal minds and emotions\n“Jane Goodall is an icon – because she was the start of so much,” said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.\nShe recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. “I wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,” Crockford said. “For me, she gave me my career.”\nGoodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn’t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the “Tri-mates,” Goodall, Dian Fossey and Biruté Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.\nThe projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. “These animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,” said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. “Jane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.”\nGoodall studied chimpanzees — as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall’s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.\nCatherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, “If they were human, we would describe them as happy,” or “If they were human, we would describe them as friends –- these two individuals together,” Hobaiter said. Goodall didn’t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.\nGoodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children’s book, called “Every Elephant Has a Name,” which will be published around early 2027.\nInspiring scientists and advocates for nature around the world\nFrom the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.\nIn 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.\nStuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, “there was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,” Pimm said Thursday. “She was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.”\nGoodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. “I really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,” said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nAnd she did it around the world. Roots & Shoots has a chapter in China, which Goodall visited multiple times.\n“My sense was that Jane Goodall was highly respected in China and that her organization was successful in China because it focused on topics like environmental and conservation education for youth that had broad appeal without touching on political sensitivities,” said Alex Wang, a University of California, Los Angeles expert on China and the environment, who previously worked in Beijing.\nWhat is left now that Goodall is gone is her unending hope, perhaps her greatest legacy.\n“She believed hope was not simply a feeling, but a tool,” Rhett Butler, founder of the nonprofit conservation-news site Mongabay, wrote in his Substack newsletter. “Hope, she would tell me, creates agency.”\nCarrying forward her legacy\nGoodall’s legacy and life’s work will continue through her family, scientists, her institute and legions of young people around the globe who are working to bridge conservation and humanitarian needs in their own communities, her longtime assistant said Thursday.\nThat includes Goodall’s son and three grandchildren, who are an important part of the work of the Jane Goodall Institute and in their own endeavors, said Mary Lewis, a vice president at the institute who began working with the famed primatologist in 1990.\nGoodall’s son, Hugo van Lawick, works on sustainable housing. He is currently in Rwanda. Grandson Merlin and granddaughter Angelo work with the institute, while grandson Nick is a photographer and filmmaker, Lewis said. “She has her own family legacy as well as the legacy through her institutes around the world,” said Lewis.\nIn addition to her famed research center in Tanzania and chimpanzee sanctuaries in other countries, including the Republic of Congo and South Africa, a new cultural center is expected to open in Tanzania late next year. There also are Jane Goodall Institutes in 26 countries, and communities are leading conservation projects in several countries, including an effort in Senegal to save critically endangered Western chimpanzees.\nBut it is the institute’s youth-led education program called Roots & Shoots that Goodall regarded as her enduring legacy because it is “empowering new generations,” Lewis said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Scientists find ancient life-size animal rock carvings in the Saudi Arabian desert\nNEW YORK (AP) — Researchers have discovered life-size rock carvings of camels, gazelles and other animals in the Saudi Arabian desert.\nThe carvings date back to around 12,000 years ago and many are over 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Scientists say they were created using a wedge-shaped rock to create sharp lines.\nSeveral were etched on narrow ledges so the artists couldn’t even step back to survey the final product as they were working.\n“To engrave that much detail with just a rock takes real skill,” said Maria Guagnin, an archaeologist with the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was involved in the discovery.\nThe animal carvings and engraving tools found at the site show that people were living in the area about 2,000 years earlier than scientists thought. It isn’t clear how they survived in such arid conditions — whether they lived off of shallow lakes that pooled for part of the year or drank water that accumulated in deep crevices.\nPeople have been creating rock art in Saudi Arabia for thousands of years, Guagnin said. But older engravings can be tricky to date since they tend not to feature writing and there are few remnants such as charcoal, which can be sent to a lab for analysis.\n“We know relatively little about art in the Middle East during this very ancient period of the human past,” Michael Harrower, a Johns Hopkins University archaeologist who wasn’t involved in the research, said in an email.\nIn the latest discovery, scientists found a rock pick buried in the landscape directly under the carvings, allowing them to date the tool and the art it was used to create. Their findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\nScientists weren’t sure if people lived in the desert during this time period since conditions were dry and water was thought to be scarce. They thought people may have moved in later, when the landscape was marked by greener pastures and lakes.\nOne of the carvings depicted an auroch, an ancestor of wild cattle that didn’t live in the desert and that went extinct. That made Guagnin wonder if the artists had encountered the animals by traveling somewhere else during the dry season.\n“They must have been fully established communities that knew the landscape really well,” she said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

German waters alone contain about 1.6 million tons (1.5 million metric tonnes) of dumped weapons, mostly from the two world wars in the 20th century. Dumped relics can contain nuclear and chemical remnants as well as explosives like TNT.\nIt’s the latest example of wildlife flourishing in polluted sites. Previous research has shown shipwrecks and former weapons complexes teeming with biodiversity.\nIn the new study, researchers filmed networks of anemones, starfish and other underwater life in the Bay of Lübeck off the coast of Germany. They were lurking on pieces of V-1 flying bombs used by Nazi Germany.\n“Normally, one does not study the ecology of bombs,” said University of Georgia ecologist James Porter, who was not involved with the research.\nThe research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment.\nWhy would sea creatures make their home on contaminated weapons? They could be drawn to the hard surfaces, which are in short supply in the Baltic Sea. The seafloor is mainly a flat bed of mud and sand because stones and boulders were fished out of the water for construction in the 1800s and 1900s, Vedenin said.\nThe area is also fairly isolated from human activity because of the chemicals, creating a somewhat protective bubble for the critters to thrive despite some toxic tradeoffs.\nScientists hope to calculate how much contamination was absorbed by sea life. Another important next step is to see what happens after the critters settle and whether they’re capable of reproducing, Porter said.\nStudies like these are a testament to how nature takes advantage of human leftovers, flipping the script to survive, said marine conservation biologist David Johnston with Duke University. He recently mapped sunken World War I ships that have become habitats for wildlife along the Potomac River in Maryland.\n“I think it’s a really cool testimony to the strength of life,” Johnston said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP) — A cluster of space weather satellites blasted off Wednesday morning to cast fresh eyes on solar storms that can produce stunning auroras but also scramble communications and threaten astronauts in flight.\nThe three satellites soared from Kennedy Space Center shortly after sunrise on the same SpaceX rocket. They aimed for a sun-orbiting lookout 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth, each on its own separate mission.\nAltogether, the satellites from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, plus related costs, are worth about $1.6 billion. NASA’s Joe Westlake calls it “the ultimate cosmic carpool” by sharing a rocket to save money.\nHeading the lineup is NASA’s Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, the first to be deployed. It will scrutinize the outer limits of the heliosphere, the protective, solar wind-driven bubble of gas around our solar system.\nAs a bonus, IMAP will be capable of providing advance notice of solar storms — a valuable 30-minute heads-up — for astronauts exploring the moon under NASA’s Artemis program. Officials expect the observatory to be fully operational by the time four astronauts fly around the moon and back next year.\nNASA’s smaller Carruthers Geocorona Observatory also is flying, focusing on Earth’s outermost, glowing atmosphere that extends well beyond the moon. It’s named after the late scientist George Carruthers, who invented the ultraviolet telescope left on the moon by the Apollo 16 astronauts in 1972.\nNOAA’s newest space weather observatory will be pushed into full-time, around-the-clock forecasting service. It will keep tab on the sun’s activity and measure the solar wind to help keep Earth safe from threatening flares.\nOfficials expect NASA’s satellites to be in position and operational by the beginning of next year, and NOAA’s spacecraft by spring.\nNASA is kicking in more than $879 million for its two missions, while NOAA’s share is $693 million.\nWhile NASA already has a fleet of sun-observing spacecraft, science mission chief Nicky Fox said these newer missions offer more advanced instruments that will provide more sensitive measurements.\n“Just being able to put all those together to give us a much, much better view of the sun,” she said.\nThe goal is to better understand the sun in order to better protect Earth, according to officials. As spectacular as they are, the northern and southern lights will not be the missions’ focus.\nDuring a preview of NASA’s upcoming Artemis mission around the moon, science officials said Tuesday that these new space weather missions will enhance forecasting and provide vital alerts if major solar activity strikes. If that happens, the four astronauts will take temporary shelter in a storage area under the capsule’s floor to avoid the heightened radiation levels.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

They prowled across what’s now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.\nMegaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and “huge and very powerful claws,” said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.\nBut it’s not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline — mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the discovery of a new dinosaur from Argentina that may have used its long arms and claws to capture prey.\nIn a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhué Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.\nThis latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali “fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,” Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\nThe creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago — close to the time dinosaurs went extinct — and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don’t know what killed it.\nThe front leg bone pressed against its jaws — belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles — could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.\nIbiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn’t yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.\n“All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,” he said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP) — NASA introduced its newest astronauts Monday, 10 scientists, engineers and test pilots chosen from more than 8,000 applicants to help explore the moon and possibly Mars.\nFor the first time, there were more women than men in an incoming astronaut class. They included a geologist who worked on NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover and a SpaceX engineer who’s already rocketed into orbit, flying on a billionaire-sponsored mission that featured the world’s first private spacewalk last year.\nThe six women and four men will undergo two years of training before becoming eligible for spaceflight.\nActing Administrator Sean Duffy said one of them could become one of the first to step on Mars. He also stressed that the U.S. will win this second race to land astronauts on the moon.\n“You are America’s best and brightest, and we’re going to need America’s best and brightest because we have a bold exploration plan for the future,” Duffy said at Monday’s ceremony at Johnson Space Center in Houston. “Some are challenging our leadership in space, say like the Chinese ... We are going to win.”\nIt is the 24th astronaut class for NASA since the original Mercury Seven made their debut in 1959. The previous class was in 2021.\nOnly 370 people have been selected by NASA as astronauts, making it an extraordinarily small and elite group composed mostly of men. The latest additions will join 41 active U.S. astronauts currently serving in the corps.\nNASA’s flight operations director Norm Knight said competition was stiff and called the newcomers “distinguished” and “exceptional.” They include several military pilots, a former SpaceX launch director and a medical doctor.\nAir Force Maj. Adam Fuhrmann said he got the call inviting him into the astronaut corps while driving home in rush hour traffic. He took the first exit and pulled into a parking lot “just to make sure I was hearing” right. Another Air Force pilot, Maj. Cameron Jones, was just settling into his new empty home after a cross-country move.\nYet another pilot, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Erin Overcash, got the news while relaxing at home. Her first words? “No way. I mean, I mean, yes, of course. But like no way.” She figures her experience stuck on a ship in the middle of the ocean with 5,000 others will serve her well dealing with space travel.\nAnna Menon, who accompanied billionaire Jared Isaacman on a SpaceX flight last September, is NASA’s first astronaut candidate to have already visited orbit. She’ll be in good company at Johnson: Her husband, a former SpaceX flight surgeon, was chosen in NASA’s last astronaut class.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey’s Lauren Edgar worked with the Curiosity rover at Mars and, most recently, the science team behind the first moon landing by astronauts under the Artemis program that’s targeted for 2027 at the earliest. “I am so excited to be officially part of the NASA family,” she said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Discovery of insects trapped in amber sheds light on ancient Amazon rainforest\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.\nMany of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment.\nAlmost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it’s long been “an enigma” that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.\nThis marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo Pérez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.\n“Amber pieces are little windows into the past,” Pérez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.\nThe researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that’s on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.\nBut today’s rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.\n“It was a different kind of forest,” said Herrera.\nThe amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.\n“I went there and realized this place is amazing,” Jaramillo said. “There’s so much amber in the mines,” and it’s more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.\nResearchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity -- including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. “Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,” said Grimaldi.\n“It’s the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,” said Pérez-de la Fuente. “And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Pollock even gave the piece a personal touch, adding his handprints near the top.\nThe painting, currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is almost 9 feet (2.7 meters) wide. Scientists had previously characterized the reds and yellows splattered across the canvas, but the source of the rich turquoise blue proved elusive.\nIn a new study, researchers took scrapings of the blue paint and used lasers to scatter light and measure how the paint’s molecules vibrated. That gave them a unique chemical fingerprint for the color, which they pinpointed as manganese blue.\nThe analysis, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific blue.\n“It’s really interesting to understand where some striking color comes from on a molecular level,” said study co-author Edward Solomon with Stanford University.\nThe pigment manganese blue was once used by artists, as well as to color the cement for swimming pools. It was phased out by the 1990s because of environmental concerns.\nPrevious research had suggested that the turquoise from the painting could indeed be this color, but the new study confirms it using samples from the canvas, said Rutgers University’s Gene Hall, who has studied Pollock’s paintings and was not involved with the discovery.\n“I’m pretty convinced that it could be manganese blue,” Hall said.\nThe researchers also went one step further, inspecting the pigment’s chemical structure to understand how it produces such a vibrant shade.\nScientists study the chemical makeup of art supplies to conserve old paintings and catch counterfeits. They can take more specific samples from Pollock’s paintings since he often poured directly onto the canvas instead of mixing paints on a palette beforehand.\nTo solve this artistic mystery, researchers explored the paint using various scientific tools — similarly to how Pollock would alternate his own methods, dripping paint using a stick or using it straight from the can.\nWhile the artist’s work may seem chaotic, Pollock rejected that interpretation. He saw his work as methodical, said study co-author Abed Haddad, an assistant conservation scientist at the Museum of Modern Art.\n“I actually see a lot of similarities between the way that we worked and the way that Jackson Pollock worked on the painting,” Haddad said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile’s Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.\nEgypt’s mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what’s now Peru and Chile.\nA new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.\nResearchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.\nStudying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.\nThe practice “allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,” study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.\nDating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it’s not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.\nThe findings offer “an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,” she said in an email.\nMummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Octopuses tend to explore with their front limbs\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Humans may be right-handed or left-handed. It turns out octopuses don’t have a dominant arm, but they do tend to perform some tasks more often with their front arms, new research shows.\nScientists studied a series of short videos of wild octopuses crawling, swimming, standing, fetching, and groping -- among other common activities -- to analyze how each of the eight arms were moving.\n“All of the arms can do all of this stuff – that’s really amazing,” said co-author and marine biologist Roger Hanlon of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\nOctopus limbs aren’t specialized as many mammal limbs are. However, the three octopus species in the study showed a clear preference for using their four front arms, which they did about 60% of the time. The back arms were used more frequently for stilting and rolling that help move the octopus forward.\n“The forward arms do most of the exploring, the rear arms are mostly for walking,” said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study.\nResearchers analyzed video clips taken between 2007 and 2015 in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It was the first large study to examine precise limb actions in the wild.\nUnlike previous research of octopus behavior in a laboratory setting, the new work showed that octopuses did not show a preference for right or left arms in their natural environment.\nResults were published Thursday in Scientific Reports.\n“I’m in awe that the researchers managed to do this,” said Janet Voight, an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who had no role in the study.\nOctopuses are shy and elusive creatures. The species studied spend most of their time hidden in dens — meaning that filming them required patience and perseverance over many years.\nOctopus limbs are complex — used for mobility and sensing the environment. Each arm contains between 100 and 200 suckers – complex sensory organs “equivalent to the human nose, lips, and tongue,” said Hanlon.\nIf an arm is bitten off by a predator, as often happens in the wild, octopuses have multiple backups.\n“When you’ve got eight arms and they’re all capable,” Hanlon said, “there’s a lot of redundancy.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "New findings by NASA Mars rover provide strongest hints yet of potential signs of ancient life\nNASA’s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life.\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.\nThey stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance — ideally in labs on Earth — before reaching any conclusions.\nWhile acknowledging the latest analysis “certainly is not the final answer,” NASA’s science mission chief Nicky Fox said it’s ”the closest we’ve actually come to discovering ancient life on Mars.”\nRoaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life, past or present. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that’s on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.\nCalling it an “exciting discovery,” a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — SETI Institute’s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Mario Parente — were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.\n“That’s part of the reason why we can’t go so far as to say, ‘A-ha, this is proof positive of life,’’’ lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. “All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.”\nEither way, Hurowitz said it’s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover’s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30. The findings appeared in the journal Nature.\n“It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?” Hurowitz said. But even if that’s not the case, it’s “a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.”\nCollected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance’s science instruments before the drill came out.\nAlong with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.\n“There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,” Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial.\nThere’s no evidence of present-day life on Mars, but NASA over the decades has sent spacecraft to Mars in search of past watery environments that might have supported life way back when.\nWhen Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort.\nUntil the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz.\nNASA’s acting Administrator Sean Duffy said budgets and timing will dictate how best to proceed, and even raised the possibility of sending sophisticated equipment to Mars to analyze the samples on the red planet. “All options are on the table,” he said.\nTen of the titanium sample tubes gathered by Perseverance were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, all part of NASA’s still fuzzy return mission.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP) — Scientists have discovered a gamma ray explosion outside our galaxy that’s not only exceptionally powerful, but also long-lasting.\nTelescopes on Earth and in space — including Hubble — have teamed up to study the unique explosion of high-energy radiation first observed in July. Astronomers reported Tuesday it’s unlike anything they’ve witnessed before.\nThe repeated bursts of gamma rays were detected over the course of a day, according to scientists. That’s highly unusual since these kinds of bursts normally last just minutes or even milliseconds — rarely no more than a few hours — as dying stars collapse or are torn apart by black holes.\nScientists said such a long and recurrent gamma ray explosion is puzzling — a cosmic whodunit, at least for now. More observations are needed to confirm its precise whereabouts.\nThe European-led team announced its findings in the Astrophysical Journal Letters in August.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(AP) — Scientists revealed Wednesday that Mars’ innermost core appears to be a solid hunk of metal just like Earth’s.\nThe Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA’s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars’ equator in 2018.\nPrevious studies pointed to liquid at the heart of the red planet. The latest findings indicate the inner core, while small, is indeed solid and surrounded by molten metal — a liquid outer core.\nThe Martian inner core extends from the planet’s center out to a radius of approximately 380 miles (613 kilometers), according to the scientists whose findings appeared in the journal Nature.\nIt’s likely composed of iron and nickel, the same ingredients as Earth’s core, but quite possibly also enriched with lighter elements like oxygen.\nMars’ liquid outer core is bigger, stretching from 380 miles (613 kilometers) to as much as 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the planet’s center.\nCrystallization of Mars’ inner core may have occurred in the past and still be occurring today, one of the lead investigators, Daoyuan Sun of the University of Science and Technology of China, said in an email.\nMars’ core initially would have been entirely liquid. It’s unclear whether the liquid outer core contains any solid material like droplets or whether there might be “a mushy zone” near the boundary between the inner and outer cores, he added.\nFor their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.\n“Our results suggest that Mars has a solid inner core making up about one-fifth of the planet’s radius — roughly the same proportion as Earth’s inner core. However, this similarity may be just coincidental,” Sun said.\nWhile praising the results, the University of Maryland’s Nicholas Schmerr, who was not involved in the study, said questions regarding Mars’ core are far from settled. With InSight out of action, there will be no new recordings of marsquakes to further reveal the red planet’s insides, he noted.\n“There are a lot of details about the exact shape of the inner core and composition of the inner and outer core of Mars that will require a network of InSight like seismometer stations to resolve,” Schmerr said in an email.\nMore detailed modeling is necessary to develop a clearer picture of how the inner core formed and “what it reveals about the history of Mars’ magnetic field,” said Sun.\nAt present, Mars lacks a magnetic field, possibly because of the slow crystallization of the planet’s solid core, Schmerr added.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "At the US Open, tennis stars shine under dark sky-friendly outdoor lights\nAt the US Open, tennis stars shine under dark sky-friendly outdoor lights\nNEW YORK (AP) — When the court lights flicker on at the U.S. Open, tennis stars shine under illumination designed to cut light pollution.\nThe wedge-shaped lamps around the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows direct light onto the players without spewing it into the surrounding skies.\nThe stadium complex is the only professional sports venue certified by a group that’s trying to preserve the night sky around the world. Across North America and Canada, schools and local parks have also swapped out their lights on baseball fields, running tracks and other recreation grounds to preserve their view of the stars and protect local wildlife.\nNight lights can disrupt bird migration and confuse nocturnal critters like frogs and fireflies. Lights on sports fields are especially bright and cool, and often cast their glare into neighborhoods.\nIn renovations over the past decade, the U.S. Tennis Association swapped metal halide bulbs for shielded LED lights. The complex’s 17 tournament courts — including Arthur Ashe Stadium — and five practice courts were approved as dark sky-friendly last year.\nUSTA officials wanted the best lighting possible on their courts, which also happened to be friendly to dark skies. Their lighting company suggested striking a balance that would satisfy crowds and TV crews while cutting down spillover into the surrounding environment.\n“This is an international event that has an impact on the community,” said the USTA’s managing director of capital projects and engineering Chuck Jettmar. “Let’s minimize that and make sure that everybody’s happy with it.”\nDesigning lights for dark skies\nU.S. Open qualifying matches this week were punctuated by players grunting, crickets chirping and audiences cheering. Rows of lights stood like sentries above, adorned with flat visors that guided the glow onto the action.\nThe lights at Flushing Meadows glow at a quarter of their brightness when the courts are rented for play during the year. They’re approved by DarkSky International, a nonprofit that gives similar designations to cities and national parks. The group widened its focus to include sports arenas in recent years and has certified over 30 venues since 2019 — including high school football fields and youth soccer fields.\n“We live in a world where we need to engage with one another in the nighttime environment, and that’s OK,” said DarkSky spokesperson Drew Reagan. “That’s a beautiful thing and there’s a way to do that responsibly.”\nThe organization typically approves proposals at sports fields before any light fixtures are installed or replaced. Once construction is complete, a representative measures the glow and glare against a set of guidelines that benefit the night.\nRenovating a field with dark skies in mind can cost about 5% to 10% more than traditional sports lighting, according to James Brigagliano, who runs DarkSky’s outdoor sports lighting program. Venues may require a few extra fixtures since the light shining from them is more targeted.\nMost arenas make the change during scheduled maintenance and renovation, working with sports lighting company Musco. The company lights over 3,000 venues a year including college football stadiums, tennis courts and rail yards.\nAt Superstition Shadows Park in Apache Junction, Arizona, kids play T-ball and baseball in the evenings, when the darkness offers a brief respite from the summer heat. The city’s parks and recreation department replaced its already-aging lights with shielded, dark sky-friendly fixtures last year with federal and local government funding.\nPeople venture to Apache Junction partly because “they can get out of the city and still see stars,” said the city’s parks and recreation director Liz Langenbach. The city is at the edge of the Phoenix metro area, bordered by rolling mountains and sweeping deserts.\n“The choices we make on lighting, I think, affect all of that,” Langenbach said.\nAt Université Sainte-Anne in Canada, students run on a new track and soccer field outfitted with lights that DarkSky approved last year. Researchers at the university study native, nocturnal animals like the northern saw-whet owl.\nThe lights are “good for everyone,” said university spokesperson Rachelle LeBlanc. “For tourism, for our students, for our neighbors, for the animals that we share our campus with.”\nHow to cut light pollution\nNight lights harm the surrounding environment no matter how shielded they are. DarkSky-approved fields still allow a small fraction of their light to be pointed up since it’s necessary to keep track of flying balls.\n“You can have the absolute best, most carefully designed stadium lighting in the world, and you’re still creating light pollution,” said Travis Longcore, an urban light pollution expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nThe U.S. Open courts are side-by-side with bright lights from Manhattan and Queens — so they can only darken a slice of the sky. But DarkSky says every light fixture makes a difference, and one professional arena can influence others.\n“I’m not saying we as humans have to turn all the lights off,” said Longcore. “I think you have to make improvements from where you are.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

New scientific analysis quadruples the count\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Giraffes are a majestic sight in Africa with their long necks and distinctive spots. Now it turns out there are four different giraffe species on the continent, according to a new scientific analysis released Thursday.\nResearchers previously considered all giraffes across Africa to belong to a single species. New data and genetic studies have led a task force of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to split the tallest mammal on land into four groups — Northern giraffes, reticulated giraffes, Masai giraffes and Southern giraffes.\nKey studies have emerged in the past decade highlighting significant differences between the four species, said the IUCN’s Michael Brown, a researcher in Windhoek, Namibia, who led the assessment.\nNaming different giraffes matters because “each species has different population sizes, threats and conservation needs,” he said. “When you lump giraffes all together, it muddies the narrative.”\nNorthern giraffes — whose range includes parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic – face threats from political instability and poaching. Masai giraffes in Kenya and Tanzania face pressure from habitat loss, as open savannas are converted to cattle pastures and fields.\nConsidering four giraffe species “is absolutely the right decision, and it’s long overdue,” said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist who wasn’t involved in the analysis.\nWhile in the past researchers scrutinized giraffes’ spots, the new categories made use of newer methods including extensive analysis of genetic data and studies highlighting key anatomical differences, such as skull shape.\nWhat appear like horns sticking up from the foreheads of giraffes are actually permanent bony protrusions from the skull, different from deer antlers that are shed annually.\nOver the past 20 years, scientists have also gathered genetic samples from more than 2,000 giraffes across Africa to study the differences, said Stephanie Fennessy at the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation, who helped in the research.\nIt used to cost tens of thousands of dollars to sequence each genome, but advances in technology have brought the cost down to about $100, making it more accessible to nonprofit and conservation groups, she said.\nAccording to population estimates from the foundation, the most endangered giraffe is the Northern giraffe, with only about 7,000 individuals left in the wild.\n“It’s one of the most threatened large mammals in the world,” said Fennessy.\nSouthern giraffes are the most populous species, with around 69,000 individuals. There are around 21,000 reticulated giraffes left in the wild, and 44,000 Masai giraffes, according to the foundation.\n“If not all giraffes are the same, then we have to protect them individually,” said Fennessy.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Scientists get a rare peek inside of an exploding star\nA supernova explosion reveals a dying star’s insides\nNEW YORK (AP) — Scientists for the first time have spotted the insides of a dying star as it exploded, offering a rare peek into stellar evolution.\nStars can live for millions to trillions of years until they run out of fuel. The most massive ones go out with a bang in an explosion called a supernova.\nUsing telescopes that peer deep into space, researchers have observed many such explosions. The cosmic outbursts tend to jumble up a dying star’s layers, making it hard for scientists to observe the inner structure.\nBut that wasn’t the case for the new discovery, a supernova called 2021yfj located more than 2 billion light years from Earth.\nThe collapsing star’s outermost layers of hydrogen and helium had peeled away long ago, which wasn’t surprising. But the star’s dense, innermost layers of silicon and sulfur had also shed during the explosion.\n“We have never observed a star that was stripped to this amount,” said Northwestern University’s Steve Schulze, who was part of the discovery team that published the research Wednesday in the journal Nature.\nThe finding lends evidence to ideas scientists have about how large stars look near the end of their lives, organized into layers with lighter elements on the outside and heavier ones close to the core.\n“Because so many of the layers had been stripped off this star, this basically confirmed what those layers were,” said Anya Nugent, who studies supernovas at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. She was not involved with the new research.\nIt’s not yet clear how this star got so whittled down — whether its layers were flung off violently in the final stages of its life or yanked away by a twin star. Future research may yield clues, though scientists acknowledged such an event may be tough to capture again.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "body": "Stone Age humans were picky about which rocks they used for making tools, study finds\nStone Age humans were picky about which rocks they used for making tools, study finds\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Early human ancestors during the Old Stone Age were more picky about the rocks they used for making tools than previously known, according to research published Friday.\nNot only did these early people make tools, they had a mental picture of where suitable raw materials were located and planned ahead to use them, traveling long distances.\nBy around 2.6 million years ago, early humans had developed a method of pounding rocks together to chip off sharp flakes that could be used as blades for butchering meat.\nThis allowed them to feast on large animals like hippos that gathered near a freshwater spring at the Nyayanga archaeological site in Kenya.\n“But hippo skin is really tough” — and not all rocks were suitable for creating blades sharp enough to pierce hippo skin, said co-author Thomas Plummer, a paleoanthropologist at Queens College of the City University of New York.\nCo-author Emma Finestone of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History added: “When we think about stone tools, not every rock is equal in terms of the quality of tools.”\nAt the Nyayanga site, researchers found durable blades made of quartzite, a rock material that they traced to streambeds and other locations around 8 miles (13 kilometers) away. The new research appears in the journal Science Advances.\n“This suggests they’ve got a mental map of where different resources are distributed across the landscape,” said co-author Rick Potts of the Smithsonian’s Human Origins Program.\nPreviously, researchers had assumed the stones may have been found within just a mile or so of the freshwater spring site.\nThe new study shows that “these early humans were thinking ahead. This is probably the earliest time we have in the archaeological record an indication of that behavior,” said Eric Delson, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.\nThe oldest previously known example of early human ancestors transporting raw materials for tool-making was about 600,000 years later than the Nyayanga site.\nResearchers said it’s unclear who these early toolmakers were — whether members of the Homo genus or a related but extinct branch of the family tree, such as Paranthropus.\nHomo sapiens did not arise until much later, around 300,000 years ago.\nBut the knack for seeking out the best raw materials to make simple technology dates back nearly 3 million years. “We today are a species that’s still technology-dependent — using tools to spread around the world and adapt to different environments,” said Finestone.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Here’s how to spot them\nNEW YORK (AP) — Six planets are hanging out in the sky this month in what’s known as a planetary parade. Catch the spectacle while you can because it’s the last one of the year.\nThese linkups happen when several planets appear to line up in the night sky at once. Such parades are fairly common, happening around every year depending on the number of planets. At least one bright planet can be spotted on most nights, weather permitting, according to NASA.\nSix planets were visible in January skies and every planet of our solar system was visible in February, but not all could be spotted with the naked eye.\nVenus, Jupiter, Saturn and a faint Mercury are visible this month without any special equipment, and the best chances to spot them are over the next week. Uranus and Neptune can only be glimpsed through binoculars and telescopes.\nJupiter and Venus made a close brush earlier this week and are still near each other in the eastern sky, “close together like cat’s eyes,” said Carolyn Sumners at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.\nMercury will be at its farthest point from the sun on Tuesday morning, making it easier to spot before it disappears into the sun’s glare.\nTo catch the planets, go out in the morning shortly before sunrise and look east. Try to find Jupiter and Venus clustered together first. Saturn is off to the side and Mercury will be close to the horizon, trying to rise before the sun.\n“You’re looking for little tiny pinpoints of light, but they are the brightest ones,” said Justin Bartel with the Science Museum of Virginia. “They don’t really twinkle like the stars do.”\nBefore heading out, make sure it is a clear, cloudless morning and try to get away from tall buildings that could block the view.\nMercury will hide behind the sun again toward the end of the month, but a crescent moon will then join the parade. The next big planetary hangout is in February.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Experts say it’s worth easing kids back into a routine with the start of a new school year.\n“We don’t say ‘ get good sleep ’ just because,” said pediatrician Dr. Gabrina Dixon with Children’s National Hospital. “It really helps kids learn and it helps them function throughout the day.”\nThe amount of sleep kids need changes as they age. Preschoolers should get up to 13 hours of sleep. Tweens need between nine and 12 hours. Teenagers do best with eight to 10 hours of shut-eye.\nSet an earlier bedtime\nEarly bedtimes can slip through the cracks over the summer as kids stay up for sleepovers, movie marathons and long plane flights. To get back on track, experts recommend setting earlier bedtimes a week or two before the first day of school or gradually going to bed 15 to 30 minutes earlier each night.\nDon’t eat a heavy meal before bed and avoid TV or screen time two hours before sleep. Instead, work in relaxing activities to slow down like showering and reading a story.\n“You’re trying to take the cognitive load off your mind,” said Dr. Nitun Verma, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “It would be like if you’re driving, you’re slowly letting go of the gas pedal.”\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\nParents can adjust their back-to-school plans based on what works best for their child. Nikkya Hargrove moves her twin daughters’ bedtimes up by 30 minutes the week before school starts.\nSometimes, her 10-year-olds will negotiate for a few extra minutes to stay up and read. Hargrove said those conversations are important as her children get older and advocate for themselves. If they stay up too late and don’t have the best morning, Hargrove said that can be a learning experience too.\n“If they’re groggy and they don’t like how they feel, then they know, ‘OK, I have to go to bed earlier,’” said Hargrove, an author and independent bookstore owner from Connecticut.\nIn the morning, soaking in some daylight by sitting at a window or going outside can help train the brain to power up, Verma said.\nSquash back-to-school sleep anxiety\nSleep quality matters just as much as duration. First-day jitters can make it hard to fall asleep no matter how early the bedtime.\nDixon says parents can talk to their kids to find out what is making them anxious. Is it the first day at a new school? Is it a fear of making new friends? Then they might try a test run of stressful activities before school starts to make those tasks feel less scary — for example, by visiting the school or meeting classmates at an open house.\nThe weeks leading up can be jam-packed and it’s not always possible to prep a routine in advance. But kids will adjust eventually so sleep experts say parents should do what they can. After all, their kids aren’t the only ones adjusting to a new routine.\n“I always say, ‘Take a deep breath, it’ll be OK,’” Dixon said. “And just start that schedule.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASA ordered Boeing’s new crew capsule to return empty and switched the pair to SpaceX. They left soon after McClain and her crew arrived to take their places. Wilmore has since retired from NASA.\nBefore leaving the space station on Friday, McClain made note of “some tumultuous times on Earth” with people struggling.\n“We want this mission, our mission, to be a reminder of what people can do when we work together, when we explore together,” she said.\nMcClain looked forward to “doing nothing for a couple of days” once back home in Houston.

Scientists say it threatens to undermine the process that has helped make the U.S. the world leader in research and development.\nThe order requires all federal agencies, including FEMA, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, to appoint officials responsible for reviewing federal funding opportunities and grants, so that they “are consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.”\nIt also requires agencies to make it so that current and future federal grants can be terminated at any time — including during the grant period itself.\nAgencies cannot announce new funding opportunities until the new protocols are in place, according to the order.\nThe Trump administration said these changes are part of an effort to “strengthen oversight” and “streamline agency grantmaking.” Scientists say the order will cripple America’s scientific engine by placing control over federal research funds in the hands of people who are influenced by politics and lack relevant expertise.\n“This is taking political control of a once politically neutral mechanism for funding science in the U.S.,” said Joseph Bak-Coleman, a scientist studying group decision-making at the University of Washington.\nThe changes will delay grant review and approval, slowing “progress for cures and treatments that patients and families across the country urgently need,” said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.\nThe administration has already terminated thousands of research grants at agencies like the NSF and NIH, including on topics like transgender health, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and diversity, equity and inclusion.\nThe order could affect emergency relief grants doled out by FEMA, public safety initiatives funded by the Department of Justice and public health efforts supported by the Centers for Disease Control.

The topic of the day’s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.\nAfter marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: “Are we going to be replaced with AI?”\nThat remains to be seen. But for the nation’s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world’s largest technology companies. The two groups don’t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country’s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.\nAFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.\n“There is no one else who is helping us with this. That’s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,” Weingarten said. “We went to them — they didn’t come to us.”\nWeingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an “agnostic” approach that means any company’s AI tools could be used in a training session.\nUnder the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.\nTech money will build an AI training hub for teachers\nWith the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.\nThe National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of “microcredentials” — online trainings open to the union’s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA’s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.\n“We tailored our partnership very surgically,” Bilal said. “We are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.”\nBoth unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.\nThe Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve “global dominance in artificial intelligence.” The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.\nTech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft’s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.\nSeveral recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.\nThe industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what’s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.\n“These are private initiatives, and they are run by companies that have a stake,” Lake said.\nMicrosoft CEO Brad Smith agrees that teachers should have a “healthy dose of skepticism” about the role of tech companies.\n“While it’s easy to see the benefits right now, we should always be mindful of the potential for unintended consequences,” Smith said in an interview, pointing to concerns such as AI’s possible impact on critical thinking. “We have to be careful. It’s early days.”\nTeachers see new possibilities\nAt the San Antonio AFT training, about 50 educators turned up for the three-hour workshop for teachers in the Northside Independent School District. It is the city’s largest, employing about 7,000 teachers.\nThe day started with a pep talk.\n“We all know, when we talk about AI, teachers say, ‘Nah, I’m not doing that,’” trainer Kathleen Torregrossa told the room. “But we are preparing kids for the future. That is our primary job. And AI, like it or not, is part of our world.”\nAttendees generated lesson plans using ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft CoPilot and two AI tools designed for schools, Khanmingo and Colorín Colorado.\nGabriela Aguirre, a 1st grade dual language teacher, repeatedly used the word “amazing” to describe what she saw.\n“It can save you so much time,” she said, and add visual flair to lessons. She walked away with a plan to use AI tools to make illustrated flashcards in English and Spanish to teach vocabulary.\n“With all the video games, the cellphones you have to compete against, the kids are always saying, ‘I’m bored.’ Everything is boring,” Aguirre said. “If you can find ways to engage them with new technology, you’ve just got to do that.”\nMiddle school teacher Celeste Simone said there is no turning back to how she taught before.\nAs a teacher for English language learners, Simone can now ask AI tools to generate pictures alongside vocabulary words and create illustrated storybooks that use students’ names as characters. She can take a difficult reading passage and ask a chatbot to translate it into Spanish, Pashto or other languages. And she can ask AI to rewrite difficult passages at any grade level to match her students’ reading levels. All in a matter of seconds.\n“I can give my students access to things that never existed before,” Simone said. “As a teacher, once you’ve used it and see how helpful it is, I don’t think I could go back to the way I did things before.”\n____\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) — Working to differentiate itself in the crowded field of artificial intelligence, Meta Platforms has launched a standalone AI app — with a social media component — to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nThe Meta AI app, built with the company’s Llama 4 AI system. It includes a “discover” feed that lets users see how others are interacting with AI. It also has a voice mode for interacting with the AI.\n“It’s smart for Meta to differentiate its ChatGPT competitor by drawing from the company’s social media roots. The app’s Discover feed is like a version of the OG Facebook Feed but only focused on AI use cases,” said Forrester research director Mike Proulx.\nBy letting users link their Facebook and Instagram accounts, the Meta AI app “gets a leg up on instantly personalizing its user experience with social media context.”\nMeta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing it for free as an open-source product. The company says more than a billion people use its AI products each month.\nAt the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant’s inaugural conference, LlamaCon, on Tuesday Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg chatted with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a technical discussion around the speed of AI development and how the technology is shifting both their companies — where AI is already writing code — as well as the world.\nAcknowledging there is a lot of “hype” around AI, Zuckerberg said “if this is going to lead to massive increases in productivity, that needs to be reflected in major increases in GDP.”\n“This is going take some multiple years, many years, to play out,” Zuckerberg said. “I’m curious how you think, what’s your current outlook on what we should be looking for to understand the progress that this is making?”\nNadella brought up the advent of electricity, saying that “AI has the promise, but you now have to sort of really have it deliver the real change in productivity — and that requires software and also management change, right? Because in some sense, people have to work with it differently.”\nHe said it took 50 years before people figured out to change how factories operated with electricity.\nZuckerberg replied “well we’re all investing as if it’s not going to take 50 years, so I hope it doesn’t take 50 years.”",

    "body": "Tech industry tried reducing AI’s pervasive bias. Now Trump wants to end its ‘woke AI’ efforts\nTech industry tried reducing AI’s pervasive bias. Now Trump wants to end its ‘woke AI’ efforts\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — After retreating from their workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs, tech companies could now face a second reckoning over their DEI work in AI products.\nIn the White House and the Republican-led Congress, “woke AI” has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to “advance equity” in AI development and curb the production of “harmful and biased outputs” are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.\nAnd the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and “responsible AI” in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on “reducing ideological bias” in a way that will “enable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,” according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.\nIn some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.\nBut the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.\nBack then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to “see” and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.\n“Black people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we’d look ridiculous sometimes,” said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people’s skin tones and other features.\nGoogle adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.\n“Consumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,” he said.\nNow Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn’t believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it’s already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere — including camera phones, video games, AI image generators — he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.\n“Google wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,” Monk said. “But could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there’s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.”\nTrump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden’s administration “coerced or colluded with” them to censor lawful speech.\nMichael Kratsios, director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden’s AI policies were “promoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.”\nThe Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: “Without proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.”\nEven before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.\nOne study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.\nFace-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google’s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as “gorillas.”\nEven government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.\nBiden’s election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.\nThen came Google’s Gemini AI chatbot — and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of “woke AI” that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.\nGoogle’s was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company’s own public research.\nGoogle tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini’s AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.\nWith Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of “downright ahistorical social agendas through AI,” naming the moment when Google’s AI image generator was “trying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America’s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.”\n“We have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,” Vance declared at the gathering. “And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens’ right to free speech.”\nA former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration’s new focus on AI’s “ideological bias” is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people’s lives.\n“Fundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,” said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.\nBut Nelson doesn’t see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.\n“I think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,” she said. “Problems that have been differently named — algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other —- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.”",

    "body": "Ex-OpenAI workers ask California and Delaware AGs to block for-profit conversion of ChatGPT maker\nFormer employees of OpenAI are asking the top law enforcement officers in California and Delaware to stop the company from shifting control of its artificial intelligence technology from a nonprofit charity to a for-profit business.\nThey’re concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harms.\n“Ultimately, I’m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it’s created,” said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.\nBacked by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.\nThe coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI’s charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.\nOpenAI said in response that “any changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.” It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.\n“This structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,” the company said in a statement.\nThe letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI’s billions of dollars of charitable assets.\nJennings said last fall she would “review any such transaction to ensure that the public’s interests are adequately protected.” Bonta’s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can’t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.\nOpenAI’s co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what’s known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity’s benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.\nOpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.\nWhile some of the signatories of this week’s letter support Musk’s lawsuit, Hedley said others are “understandably cynical” because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.\nThe signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year’s Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.\n“I like OpenAI’s mission to ‘ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,’ and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,” Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. “I’m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.”\nConflicts over OpenAI’s purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman’s short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.\nHedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.\nIn recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.\n“The costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,” he said. “I think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.”\nSoftware engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI’s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI’s nonprofit charter is a “stop-and-assist clause” that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.\n“If OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI’s duty to the public can vanish overnight,” Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.\nAnother former worker who signed the letter puts it more bluntly.\n“OpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed,” said Nisan Stiennon, an AI engineer who worked at OpenAI from 2018 to 2020. “It is to OpenAI’s credit that it’s controlled by a nonprofit with a duty to humanity. This duty precludes giving up that control.”\n___\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.",

    "body": "OpenAI picks labor icon Dolores Huerta and other philanthropy advisers as it moves toward for-profit\nOpenAI has named labor leader Dolores Huerta and three others to a temporary advisory board that will help guide the artificial intelligence company’s philanthropy as it attempts to shift itself into a for-profit business.\nHuerta, who turned 95 last week, formed the first farmworkers union with Cesar Chavez in the early 1960s and will now voice her ideas on the direction of philanthropic initiatives that OpenAI says will consider “both the promise and risks of AI.”\nThe group will have just 90 days to make their suggestions.\n“She recognizes the significance of AI in today’s world and anybody who’s been paying attention for the last 50 years knows she will be a force in this conversation,” said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI’s new nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors.\nHuerta’s advice won’t be binding but the presence of a social activist icon could be influential as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attempts a costly restructuring of the San Francisco company’s corporate governance, which requires the approval of California’s attorney general and others.\nAnother coalition of labor leaders and nonprofits recently petitioned state Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, to investigate OpenAI, halt the proposed conversion and “protect billions of dollars that are under threat as profit-driven hunger for power yields conflicts of interest.”\nOpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started out in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory dedicated to safely building better-than-human AI that benefits humanity.\nIt later formed a for-profit arm and shifted most of its staff there, but is still controlled by a nonprofit board of directors. It is now trying to convert itself more fully into a for-profit corporation but faces a number of hurdles, including getting the approval of California and Delaware attorneys general, potentially buying out the nonprofit’s pricy assets and fighting a lawsuit from co-founder and early investor Elon Musk.\nBacked by Japanese tech giant SoftBank, OpenAI last month said it’s working to raise $40 billion in funding, putting its value at $300 billion.\nHuerta will be joined on the new advisory commission by former Spanish-language media executive Monica Lozano; Robert Ross, the recently retired president of The California Endowment; and Jack Oliver, an attorney and longtime Republican campaign fundraiser. Zingale, the group’s convener, is a former aide to California governors including Democrat Gavin Newsom and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n“We’re interested in how you put the power of AI in the hands of everyday people and the community organizations that serve them,” Zingale said in an interview Wednesday. “Because, if AI is going to bring a renaissance, or a dark age, these are the people you want to tip the scale in favor of humanity.”\nThe group is now tasked with gathering community feedback for the problems OpenAI’s philanthropy could work to address. But for California nonprofit leaders pushing for legal action from the state attorney general, it doesn’t alter what they view as the state’s duty to pause the restructuring, assess the value of OpenAI’s charitable assets and make sure they are used in the public’s interest.\n“As impressive as the individual members of OpenAI’s advisory commission are, the commission itself appears to be a calculated distraction from the core problem: OpenAI misappropriating its nonprofit assets for private gain,” said Orson Aguilar, the CEO and founding president of LatinoProsperity, in a written statement.\n——————————-\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.",

    "body": "One Tech Tip: Annoyed by junk calls to your iPhone? Try the new iOS 26 call screen feature\nLONDON (AP) — iPhone users have a new tool to combat the scourge of nuisance phone calls: a virtual gatekeeper that can screen incoming calls from unknown numbers.\nIt’s among the bevy of new features that Apple rolled out with last month’s release of iOS 26. The screening feature has been getting attention because of the ever-increasing amount of robocalls and spam calls that leave many phone users feeling harassed.\nHere’s a run-through of the new function:\nHow to activate call screening\nFirst, you’ll need to update your iPhone’s operating system to iOS 26, which is available to the iPhone 11 and newer models.\nTo switch call screening on, go into Settings--Apps—Phone. Scroll down and you’ll find a new option: Screen Unknown Callers.\nYou’ll be presented with three choices. The Never option lets any unknown call ring through, while Silence sends all unidentified numbers directly to voicemail. What you want to tap is the middle option: Ask Reason for Calling.\nIf the option isn’t there, try restarting your phone.\nI still couldn’t find it after updating to iOS 26, but, after some online sleuthing, I checked my region and language settings because I saw some online commenters reporting they had to match. It turns out my region was still set to Hong Kong, where I lived years ago. I switched it to the United Kingdom, which seemed to do the trick and gave me the updated menu.\nHow it works\nCall screening introduces a layer between you and new callers.\nWhen someone who’s not in your contacts list dials your number, a Siri-style voice will ask them to give their name and the purpose of their call.\nAt the same time, you’ll get a notification that the call is being screened. When the caller responds, the answers will be transcribed and the conversation will pop up in speech bubbles.\nYou can then answer the call.\nDon’t want to answer? Send a reply by tapping one of the pre-written messages, such as “I’ll call you later” or “Send more information,” which the AI voice will read out to the caller.\nOr you can type out your own message for the computer-generated voice to read out.\nIf you don’t respond right away, the phone will continue to ring while you decide what to do.\nTeething troubles\nIn theory, call screening is a handy third way between the nuclear option of silencing all unknown callers — including legitimate ones — or letting them all through.\nBut it doesn’t always work perfectly, according to Associated Press colleagues and anecdotal reports from social media users.\nOne AP colleague said she was impressed with how seamlessly it worked. Another said it’s handy for screening out cold callers who found his number from marketing databases.\n“However, it’s not great when delivery drivers try to call me and then just hang up,” he added.\nSome internet users have similar complaints, complaining that important calls that they were expecting from their auto mechanic or plumber didn’t make it through. Perhaps the callers assumed it was an answering machine and didn’t seem to realize they had to stay on the line and interact with it.\nI encountered a different issue the first time it kicked in for me, when an unknown caller — whether mistakenly or not — threw me off by giving my name instead of theirs. So I answered because I assumed it was someone I knew, forgetting that I could tap out a reply asking them again for their name.\nThe caller turned out to be someone who had obtained my name and number and was trying to get me to do a survey. I had to make my excuses and hang up.\nIf you don’t like call screening, you can turn it off at any time.\nAs for Android\nApple is catching up with Google, which introduced a similar automatic call screening feature years ago for Pixel users in the United States.\nLast month, the company announced the feature is rolling out to users in three more countries: Australia, Canada and Ireland.\nIf it’s not already on, go to your Phone app’s Settings and look for Call Screen.\nGoogle’s version is even more automated. When someone you don’t know calls, the phone will ask who it is and why they’re calling. It will hang up if it determines that it’s a junk call, but let calls it deems to be legit ring through.\nGoogle warns that not all spam calls and robocalls can be detected, nor will it always fully understand and transcribe what a caller says.\nSamsung, too, lets users of its Galaxy Android phones screen calls by using its AI assistant Bixby’s text call function, which works in a similar way.\n____\nIs there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

    "body": "One Tech Tip: OpenAI adds parental controls to ChatGPT for teen safety\nLONDON (AP) — OpenAI said Monday it’s adding parental controls to ChatGPT that are designed to provide teen users of the popular platform with a safer and more “age-appropriate” experience.\nThe company is taking action after AI chatbot safety for young users has hit the headlines. The technology’s dangers have been recently highlighted by a number of cases in which teenagers took their lives after interacting with ChatGPT.\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has even opened an inquiry into several tech companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.\nIn a blog post posted Monday, OpenAI outlined the new controls for parents. Here is a breakdown:\nGetting started\nThe parental controls will be available to all users, but both parents and teens will need their own accounts to take advantage of them.\nTo get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the “Parental controls” section.\nTeens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.\nAutomatic safeguards\nOnce the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.\nTeen accounts will “automatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,” the company said.\nParents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don’t have the option.\nOpenAI warns that such guardrails are “not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.” It advised parents to talk with their children about “healthy AI use.”\nAdjusting settings\nParents are getting a control panel where they can adjust a range of settings as well as switch off the restrictions on sensitive content mentioned above.\nFor example, does your teen stay up way past bedtime to use ChatGPT? Parents can set a quiet time when the chatbot can’t be used.\nOther settings include turning off the AI’s memory so conversations can’t be saved and won’t be used in future responses; turning off the ability to generate or edit images; turning off voice mode; and opting out of having chats used to train ChatGPT’s AI models.\nGet notified\nOpenAI is also being more proactive when it comes to letting parents know that their child might be in distress.\nIt’s setting up a new notification system to inform them when something might be “seriously wrong” and a teen user might be thinking about harming themselves.\nA small team of specialists will review the situation and, in the rare case that there are “signs of acute distress,” they’ll notify parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone — unless the parent has opted out.\nOpenAI said it will protect the teen’s privacy by only sharing the information needed for parents or emergency responders to provide help.\n“No system is perfect, and we know we might sometimes raise an alarm when there isn’t real danger, but we think it’s better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent,” the company said.\n____\nIs there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

    "body": "One Tech Tip: How to move your music library to another streaming platform\nLONDON (AP) — Want to switch to Apple Music because you can’t find your favorite indie band on Spotify? Or maybe you’re on Amazon Music but saw a new subscriber offer on Tidal that’s too good to pass up.\nThere are a variety of reasons to change music providers. But if you’re thinking about it, and you’re worried about losing your library of saved songs and personalized playlists, fear not: there are ways to bring all of it with you.\nMany music streaming services don’t make it obvious — often burying instructions deep in FAQs and making the process arduous — but they do offer options to help migrate your collection.\nApple made it easier last month when it quietly rolled out a new feature allowing users to import libraries from rival sites. Having Apple officially incorporate the feature might give reluctant users the confidence to move.\nSome pointers to help you along with your musical migration.\nImporting into Apple Music\nThe iPhone maker recently published a help page to walk users through the process of importing libraries into Apple Music.\nThe feature, buried in your settings, is provided by a third-party service called Songshift. It’s currently available to users in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nTo use it, you’ll need an Apple Music account and the latest version of iOS or the Android Apple Music app.\nOn iPhone, go to Settings, then Apps, then Music. Tap “Transfer Music from Other Music Services” to pop up a list of various streaming services. Android users can follow a similar process. Transfers can also be done through a web browser at music.apple.com.\nAfter choosing a service, another screen appears, prompting you to log into the target account.\nNow you get a menu with options to import “All Songs and Albums” as well as “All Playlists.” If you don’t want all your playlists, you can untick the ones you don’t want. However, you can’t pick individual songs and albums.\nApple Music will then replicate your library based on your choices.\nImporting my Spotify library, with about 150 playlists, went fairly smoothly, although the process took about half an hour because the service also downloaded around 1,230 songs and albums to my iPhone.\nI had assumed that ticking “All Songs and Albums” meant that Apple Music would mirror the handful of music I had downloaded to my Spotify app, but it also downloaded all 63 albums in my Spotify library and the 440 songs on my Liked Songs list, which I normally listen to via streaming. If you don’t want to download everything, unselect that option before you start.\nAlso note that Apple says playlists “created by the music service” can’t be transferred, so I couldn’t bring Spotify-curated lists like This is Taylor Swift or Alternative 80s with me.\nIt also meant that my Liked Songs list, which Spotify generates for every user — and a list I’ve been adding to over the years — couldn’t be replicated. Any downloaded songs were just dumped into Apple Music’s library.\nAfter this story was first published, reader Linda Feaster wrote in with a workaround: create your own playlist and then add all the tracks from the Spotify playlist. It could be tedious if there are hundreds of songs but should do the trick.\nIf you’re tempted to try out the tool, note that it probably won’t work the same way with every service. Apple warns that what can be transferred is up to the source platform. Playlists made by others, such as BBC Music’s The Sounds of 1994, for example, did make it over.\nAfter the move is done, you’ll have 30 days to review songs that aren’t available or don’t have an exact match in Apple’s catalog, and choose from any alternate versions.\nWorking with other music platforms\nMost of the other big music streaming platforms offer ways to transfer your library to their site. They mostly rely on standalone third-party services that have been around for a while, are free to use, and don’t need app integration to work.\nTidal and Deezer both direct users on their websites to one such service, Tune My Music, which works with popular platforms like Spotify as well as a host of lesser known sites.\nAmazon Music’s webpage has dedicated buttons for Tune My Music and two similar services, Songshift and Soundiiz.\nGoogle also advises third-party services for YouTube Music users who want to import or export playlists, albums, artists and tracks. However, for Apple Music users who want to move to YouTube Music, the process is different. You’ll have to sign in to Apple Music and request a transfer a copy of your data, then export it directly to YouTube Music.\n“The transfer process may take several hours if you have many playlists,” Google warns on its support page.\nSpotify says it’s currently testing a way for users to transfer their libraries and expects to provide more details soon.\nUsing a third-party service to migrate between platforms\nIt was super easy to move my Spotify library to Deezer using Tune My Music.\nI clicked a button on the Deezer website that got the process started by prompting me to log in to my Spotify account. Then a menu came up with pre-ticked options on what I could migrate: my entire library, favorite songs, favorite albums, favorite artists and any or all of my 150 playlists.\nI decided to move it all over, which amounted to more than 16,359 items. It took about five minutes. Unlike Apple Music, Deezer didn’t download any files, it just copied lists.\nA few dozen songs went missing, Tune My Music said.\n“It usually happens because the song doesn’t exist on the new platform, or it’s named a bit differently and couldn’t be matched,” it said, but added that I could download a list of missing tracks to look for them on the new platform.\nAfter you finish transferring your music library, don’t forget that it’s still on the original platform and hasn’t been deleted.\nMost third-party transfer services are free, but also offer premium levels with more features, such as instant syncing of libraries between multiple streaming sites.\n___\nAP Business Writer James Pollard in New York contributed to this report.\n____\nIs there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

    "body": "One Tech Tip: Ditch the chatbots and take your AI nature apps on a birdwatching hike\nOne Tech Tip: Ditch the chatbots and take your AI nature apps on a birdwatching hike\nI didn’t notice the scarlet tanager until the alert appeared on my phone: “Merlin heard a new bird!”\nDespite its brilliant plumage — jet-black wings on a crimson body — the songbird can be a hard one to spot in a forest because it prefers to stay high in the canopy. It sounds a little like a robin to an untrained ear.\nBut the free Merlin Bird ID app detected a scarlet tanager was likely nearby by using artificial intelligence to analyze my phone’s live sound recording. I paused my hike, quietly scanned the treetops, saw the bird as it kept singing and clicked a button to add the species to my growing “life list” of bird sightings. Digital confetti burst on my screen.\nLike a real-world version of Pokémon Go, a gotta-catch-'em-all drive to add to my Merlin list has helped me find a great kiskadee in Mexico and a rusty-cheeked scimitar-babbler in the Himalayas. But sometimes the greatest revelations are close to home, as more AI nature app users are starting to discover.\n“Our stereotypical demographic five years ago would have been retired people and already-avid birders,” said the Merlin app’s manager, Drew Weber, of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. “Now we’re seeing a lot of 20-and-30-year-olds posting stuff on their TikTok or Instagram.”\nAre you a bird person now?\n“Am I a bird person now? Am I a bird person now?” exclaims one incredulous TikTok user whose Merlin app detected a tufted titmouse, a cardinal and a Carolina wren within five seconds of her switching on the app.\nAnother video shows Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold gushing about the technology.\n“That was a northern mockingbird,” says a smirking Darnold, then 27 and now 28, holding his phone up high while sitting in an outdoor lounge chair.\nThe app isn’t always perfect, and mockingbirds — because they mimic other bird sounds — can sometimes confuse the AI. Was that really a great horned owl that flew over your home and hooted while you left the app on record by the window screen? Maybe, maybe not.\n“Low-frequency sounds can be challenging because there’s other low frequencies, like cars driving past, that can trick it,” Weber said.\nAI nature apps are not just for the birds\nBuilt-in computer vision technology on newer iPhones and Android devices makes it easier to identify plants and other creatures without having to download an app. Simply look at the flower you just photographed and — on iPhones — a leaf icon appears that, when clicked, can suggest the species.\nBut their AI accuracy isn’t always the best for more obscure fauna and insects — and they are missing the immersive community and citizen science experience that free apps like Merlin and the image-based iNaturalist offer.\nEvery observation submitted to iNaturalist, run by a nonprofit, and Cornell’s Merlin is potentially helping with conservation research as animal extinctions and biodiversity loss accelerate around the world.\niNaturalist’s executive director, Scott Loarie, sees someone’s urge to identify a backyard plant as just the start of their engagement with the app. The nonprofit also owns a sibling app, Seek, that is kid-friendly and less complicated.\n“Our strategy is really building this community of really passionate, engaged nature stewards who are not only learning and sharing knowledge about nature, but they’re actually huge engines for creating biodiversity data and conservation action,” Loarie said.\nSubmit an incorrect ID suggested by iNaturalist’s AI and someone with real expertise will often politely correct you. Once there’s enough consensus, you’ll be notified that your observation has made it to “research grade.”\nDon’t use AI apps to pick strange berries (but I did)\nOn the search for huckleberry, a favorite of jam makers and grizzly bears, I kept iNaturalist handy on an August hike through the Wyoming wilderness.\nAnd while I had a hard time finding a huckleberry bush, iNaturalist helped me discover other fruits: a type of serviceberry known as the saskatoon; the big-leafed, raspberry-like thimbleberry and the vibrant orange berries of the Greene’s mountain-ash, a type of rowan. After cross-checking many other resources, I tasted all three. The first two were sweet, the last bitter and disgusting.\n“You should never trust any sort of automatic ID or a stranger on the internet for something as important as edible plants,” Loarie said. “So, I definitely don’t want to endorse that. But I’d certainly endorse getting to know plants and animals.”\nOne common thread in the TikTok videos is the joy of discovering the variety of wildlife that live among us, if we pay enough attention.\nElsewhere, I’ve found it particularly helpful in identifying things to avoid – poison ivy, poison oak, disease-carrying ticks – and things to destroy, like a nymph of the invasive spotted lanternfly that’s now infesting at least 19 U.S. states.\n————-\nIs there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

    "body": "How social media became a storefront for deadly fake pills\nHow social media became a storefront for deadly fake pills\nCoco loved being the life of the party — cracking jokes, doing pranks and making people laugh, her mom, Julianna Arnold, recalled recently.\n“Her favorite pastime was fashion,” Arnold said. “She didn’t like looking at magazines or going to fancy stores, but preferred to make her own creations from used clothing she would find at thrift stores.... And they always looked fabulous on her.”\nIn 2022, two weeks after she turned 17, Coco left home just outside New York City to meet with a dealer she’d messaged through Instagram who promised to sell her Percocet. She never made it home. She was found dead the next day, two blocks from the address that the guy had provided her.\nWhatever the dealer gave Coco, her mother said, was not Percocet. It was a fake pill laced with fentanyl, which can be lethal in a dose as small as the tip of a pencil.\nFentanyl overdoses have become a leading cause of death for minors in the last five years or so, even as overall drug use has dropped slightly. In a 2022 analysis of fentanyl-laced prescription pills, the DEA found that six out of 10 contained a potentially lethal dose of the drug.\nAnd social media, where tainted, fake prescription drugs can be obtained with just a few clicks, is a big part of the problem. Experts, law enforcement and children’s advocates say companies like Snap, TikTok, Telegram and Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, are not doing enough to keep children safe.\nA few taps away\nThe stories of these victims often play out similarly: The kids hear you can get pills on social media. A few taps later and then a package arrives. They retreat to the sanctity of their bedroom and take a pill. Fifteen minutes later, they’re dead. No one even knows until the next morning.\nPaul DelPonte, executive director and CEO of the National Crime Prevention Council, likened this crisis to a Johnson & Johnson incident in 1982 when seven people died due to Tylenol bottles that had been tampered with. In that case, J&J recalled all bottles and stopped production until they discovered the source of the problem.\n“As a result, we now have tamper-resistant caps on over-the-counter medicines and in other products. That’s corporate responsibility,” he said. “For years, social media companies have known this has been happening, yet they continue to operate their platforms without any significant changes.”\nWhile data on the prevalence of drug sales on social platforms is hard to come by, the National Crime Prevention Council estimates 80% of teen and young adult fentanyl poisoning deaths can be traced to some social media contact.\nIn a sweeping 2023 report on the problem, Colorado’s attorney general called the availability of fentanyl and other illicit substances online “staggering.”\n“Due to their ubiquity, convenience, and lack of regulation, social media platforms have become a major venue for drug distribution,” the report said. “Where once a teen might have had to seek out a street dealer, hassle friends, or learn to navigate the dark web to access illicit drugs, young people can now locate drug dealers using their smartphones — with the relative ease of ordering food delivery or calling a ride-share service.”\nAccidental overdoses in the U.S. have decreased slightly each year since 2021 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. DelPonte attributes this in part to more education and awareness about the issue. Among young people ages 0 to 19, there were 1,622 overdose deaths in 2021, then 1,590 in 2022, and 1,511 last year.\nThe decline, DelPonte said, is “very small.”\nA decade ago, people looking to buy illicit drugs online would visit the dark web. But this was quickly eclipsed by social media and messaging platforms’ rise. Using popular social media sites, encrypted chats, legitimate payment and shipping services, dealers moved into the light. Social platforms say they are constantly working to address the issue, while law enforcement has made some inroads.\nLast May, for instance, the Drug Enforcement Administration’s “Operation Last Mile,” targeting Mexico’s Sinaloa and Jalisco Cartels, led to 3,337 arrests and the seizure of nearly 44 million fentanyl pills and other deadly drugs. More than 1,100 associated cases involved social media apps and encrypted communications platforms, the DEA said.\nOn Instagram, as recently as this summer, a simple hashtag search for popular prescription drugs brought up numerous results with accounts offering to sell illicit pills to anyone looking. Many accounts directed users to Snapchat or Telegram, where experts say encryption and alleged lax moderation make it even easier to engage in illegal activity. Money is sent through payment platforms and the drugs can be delivered by mail, DelPonte said.\nMeta, for its part, has made it more difficult to search for drugs on its platform in recent weeks.\n‘Never in a million years’\nMikayla Brown lost her son Elijah, who went by Eli, to a suspected fentanyl overdose in 2023, two weeks after his 15th birthday. Eli loved skateboarding, video games and cooking. His favorite was spicy Cajun pasta his mom made and he just started to get into cooking himself.\nEli began experimenting with marijuana in high school and he was going through what seemed like a phase many teenagers go through, his mom said. The family decided he’d go live with his biological father about three hours away in Woodland Hills in Los Angeles, to try to get a handle on what Brown called Eli’s “rebellion era.”\nBrown said the family “never in a million years” would have thought he was getting into anything more dangerous than that. There was one exception, about a year before he passed away, his mom found him acting funny and he admitted to having taken Xanax, a prescription anti-anxiety drug.\nOn a September evening last year, Eli arrived home from a friend’s house, had dinner with his dad and stayed up late to watch a movie.\nHis father sent him to bed around “2 a.m., I guess,” Brown said. “And then when his alarm went off in the morning to wake up Eli for school he found him in his room...”\nEli was unresponsive. His cause of death was accidental fentanyl overdose. But he wasn’t trying to buy fentanyl, he was looking for Xanax, and, like Coco, ended up with tainted pills that killed him.\nUntil recently, a search for #Xanax on Instagram led to a warning page specifying that “This may be associated with the sale of drugs” and that the “sale, purchase of trade of illicit drugs can cause harm to yourself and others and is illegal in most countries.” A blue “Get help” link directed users to federal substance abuse resources. Underneath that link, users could click to “see results anyway.” After it was pointed out by the AP, the company quickly removed the ability to “see results anyway” for location-specific hashtags such as #xanaxdallas or #xanaxchicago. Later, it also removed the “see results” option entirely for common drugs such as Xanax, cocaine and Adderall, among others.\nMeta also said it investigated accounts shared by The Associated Press and concluded they were not drug dealers, but financial scam artists based in Africa pretending to sell drugs locally.\nMeta says it blocks and filters “hundreds” of terms associated with illicit drug sales and links to recovery and substance abuse resources when possible. But drug dealers and other bad actors constantly shift their strategies, coming up with fresh ways to avoid detection.\nDavid Decary-Hetu, a professor at the School of Criminology at the University of Montreal, said Meta, in particular, has been “quite effective” in targeting people who sell drugs on its social platforms. But, he added, “it doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen.”\nIn a statement, Meta said drug dealers “are criminals who stop at nothing to sell their dangerous products. This is a challenge that spans across platforms, industries, and communities, and it requires all of us working together to address it.”\nThe company added that it works with law enforcement and proactively took down 2 million pieces of content, 99.7% before they were reported in the first three months of 2024.\n“Our hearts go out to the families suffering at the hands of these criminals and we are committed to working with others to prevent these tragedies,” Meta added.\nA persistent problem\nCoco’s mother had many discussions with her daughter about being careful online.\nThe teen was in therapy — social media really affected her and she developed anxiety and depression, Arnold said. She frequently checked Coco’s social media and limited her time on Snapchat to 15 minutes per day.\n“She knew about a lot of this stuff. We had talked about it. But then when this came up on Instagram, you know, I wasn’t checking and I couldn’t check all of her direct messages. It’s hard to know as a parent, no matter how on top of it you are,” she said.\nCoco’s death is still under investigation, Arnold said.\nArnold said it took five months to remove the dealer’s profile from Instagram. Occasionally, she checks to see if he’s there under another name.\n“I typed in something that I thought maybe could work, you know, based on what his previous handle had been. And there he was. He was back up under a different a different handle,” she said. “But I recognized his photo and I reported it to the police. And now again, it’s taking months to get it taken down.”\nExperts often single out Snapchat as a particularly dangerous platform, something the company vehemently disagrees with. In October 2022, a group of parents who say their children bought fentanyl from drug dealers they met through Snapchat sued the company for wrongful death and negligence, calling it a “haven for drug trafficking.”\n“Despite Snap promoting and portraying Snapchat as a ‘goofy’ app for kids to use to send each other silly pictures, its known common use is as an ‘open-air drug market,’” the lawsuit claims. Snapchat’s role in illicit drug sales to teens, it continues, “was the foreseeable result of the designs, structures, and policies Snap chose to implement to increase its revenues.”\nThe vast majority of fentanyl deaths among young people, the lawsuit says, involve kids who don’t know they are ingesting fentanyl. Rather, they are buying what they believe is marijuana, MDMA or prescription drugs like OxyContin. In January, a judge ruled that the lawsuit could move to trial.\nIt’ll be yet another test for Section 230, a 1996 law that generally exempts internet companies from liability for material users post on their networks.\nIn a statement, Snap said it is “heartbroken by the fentanyl epidemic and are deeply committed to the fight against it.”\n“We’ve invested in advanced technology to detect and remove illicit drug-related content, work extensively with law enforcement helping to bring dealers to justice, and continue to raise awareness and evolve our service to help keep our community safe. Criminals have no place on Snapchat,” said Jacqueline Beauchere, Global Head of Platform Safety at the company.\nWhile Snap wouldn’t comment on the lawsuit itself, the company argues its design actually makes it more difficult for bad actors to operate. For instance, the company says, it doesn’t allow people to get messages from people they haven’t added as friends or have a phone contact, and location sharing is off by default.\nRegulatory remedies?\nAdvocates are hoping that regulation of tech companies could help address the problem, as it might help with other dangers kids face on social media. In July, the Senate passed the Kids Online Safety Act, legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content. It still awaits a vote in the House. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., meanwhile, introduced a bill that would require social media companies to report illicit fentanyl, methamphetamine and fake pill activity occurring on their platforms to law enforcement.\n“We must do more at the federal level to combat the flow of fentanyl into our communities, and it starts by holding social media companies accountable for their part in facilitating illicit drug sales,” Shaheen said.\nBut for parents like Arnold, Brown and others who already lost their children to overdoses, it is too late.\n“Social media companies have the ability to make their platforms drug-free zones,” DelPonte said. “Instead, they keep evading the meaningful changes to keep the public safe.”",

The harm is more than skin deep\nWhen she was in fifth grade, Anna Goddard’s daughter started to worry about getting wrinkles. She used adult skin care products she saw on social media and the harm was more than skin deep.\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — When she was in fifth grade, Scarlett Goddard Strahan started to worry about getting wrinkles.\nBy the time she turned 10, Scarlett and her friends were spending hours on TikTok and YouTube watching influencers tout products for achieving today’s beauty aesthetic: a dewy, “glowy,” flawless complexion. Scarlett developed an elaborate skin care routine with facial cleansers, mists, hydrating masks and moisturizers.\nOne night, Scarlett’s skin began to burn intensely and erupted in blisters. Heavy use of adult-strength products had wreaked havoc on her skin. Months later, patches of tiny bumps remain on Scarlett’s face, and her cheeks turn red in the sun.\n“I didn’t want to get wrinkles and look old,” says Scarlett, who recently turned 11. “If I had known my life would be so affected by this, I never would have put these things on my face.”\nScarlett’s experience has become common, experts say, as preteen girls around the country throng beauty stores to buy high-end skin care products, a trend captured in viral videos with the hashtag #SephoraKids. Girls as young as 8 are turning up at dermatologists’ offices with rashes, chemical burns and other allergic reactions to products not intended for children’s sensitive skin.\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\n“When kids use anti-aging skin care, they can actually cause premature aging, destroy the skin barrier and lead to permanent scarring,” says Dr. Brooke Jeffy, a Scottsdale, Arizona, dermatologist who has posted her own social media videos rebutting influencers’ advice.\nMore than the physical harm, parents and child psychologists worry about the trend’s effects on girls’ mental health — for years to come. Extensive data suggests a fixation on appearance can affect self-esteem and body image and fuel anxiety, depression and eating disorders.\nThe skin care obsession offers a window into the role social media plays in the lives of today’s youth and how it shapes the ideals and insecurities of girls in particular. Girls are experiencing high levels of sadness and hopelessness. Whether social media exposure causes or simply correlates with mental health problems is up for debate. But to older teens and young adults, it’s clear: Extended time on social media has been bad for them, period.\nYoung girls’ fascination with makeup and cosmetics is not new. Neither are kids who hold themselves to idealized beauty standards. What’s different now is the magnitude, says Kris Perry, executive director of Children and Screens, a nonprofit that studies how digital media impacts child development. In an era of filtered images and artificial intelligence, some of the beautiful faces they encounter aren’t even real.\n“Girls are being bombarded with idealized images of beauty that establish a beauty standard that could be very hard — if not impossible — to attain,” Perry says.\nSaving allowances for Sephora hauls\nThe obsession with skin care is about more than the pursuit of perfect skin, explains 14-year-old Mia Hall.\nIt’s about feeling accepted and belonging to a community that has the lifestyle and look you want, says Mia, a New Yorker from the Bronx.\nSkin care was not on Mia’s radar until she started eighth grade last fall. It was a topic of conversation among girls her age — at school and on social media. Girls bonded over their skin care routines.\n“Everyone was doing it. I felt like it was the only way I could fit in,” says Mia. She started following beauty influencers like Katie Fang and Gianna Christine, who have millions of young followers on TikTok. Some influencers are paid by brands to promote their products, but they don’t always mention that.\nMia got hooked on “Get Ready With Me” videos, where influencers film themselves getting ready — for school, for a night out with friends, packing for a trip. The hashtag #GRWM has over 150 billion views on TikTok.\n“It’s like a trance. You can’t stop watching it,” Mia says. “So when they tell me, ‘Go buy this product’ or, ‘I use this and it’s amazing,’ it feels very personal. Getting what they have makes me feel connected to them.”\nMia started saving her $20 weekly allowance for trips with friends to Sephora. Her daily routine included a face wash, a facial mist, a hydrating serum, a pore-tightening toner, a moisturizer and sunscreen. Most were luxury brands like Glow Recipe, Drunk Elephant or Caudalie, whose moisturizers can run $70.\n“I get really jealous and insecure a lot when I see other girls my age who look very pretty or have an amazing life,” she says.\nThe level of detail and information girls are getting from beauty tutorials sends a troubling message at a vulnerable age, as girls are going through puberty and searching for their identities, says Charlotte Markey, a body image expert and Rutgers University psychologist.\n“The message to young girls is that, ‘You are a never-ending project to get started on now.’ And essentially: ‘You are not OK the way you are’,”’ says Markey, author of “The Body Image Book for Girls.”\nProducts promoting youth, purchased by kids\nThe beauty industry has been cashing in on the trend. Last year, consumers under age 14 drove 49% of drug store skin sales, according to a NielsonIQ report that found households with teens and tweens were outspending the average American household on skin care. And in the first half of 2024, a third of “prestige” beauty sales, at stores like Sephora, were driven by households with tweens and teens, according to market research firm Circana.\nThe cosmetics industry has acknowledged certain products aren’t suitable for children but has done little to stop kids from buying them. Drunk Elephant’s website, for example, recommends kids 12 and under should not use their anti-aging serums, lotions and scrubs “due to their very active nature.” That guidance is on the site’s FAQ page; there are no such warnings on the products themselves.\nSephora declined to comment for this story.\nIngredients like retinol and chemical exfoliants like hydroxy acids are inherently harsh. For aging skin, they are used to stimulate collagen and cell production. Young or sensitive skin can react with redness, peeling and burning that can lead to infections, acne and hypersensitivity if used incorrectly, dermatologists say.\nDermatologists agree a child’s face typically needs only three items, all found on drugstore shelves: a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer and sunscreen.\nA California bill aimed at banning the sale of anti-aging skin care products to children under age 13 failed this spring, but Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee says he plans to continue pursuing industry accountability. Lee and other critics say popular brands use colorful packaging and product names like “Baby facial” to attract younger buyers in the same way that e-cigarette companies and alcohol brands created fruity flavors that appeal to underage users.\nLee points to Europe as setting the right example. The European Union enacted legislation last year that limits the concentration of retinol in all over-the-counter products. And one of Sweden’s leading pharmacy chains, Apotek Hjartat, said in March it would stop selling anti-aging skin care products to customers under 15 without parental consent. “This is a way to protect children’s skin health, finances and mental well-being,” the company said.\nOne mother ‘got rid of them all’\nAround the country, concerned mothers are visiting dermatologists with their young daughters, carrying bags filled with their child’s skin care products to ask: Are these OK?\n“Often the mothers are saying exactly what I am but need their child to hear it from an expert,” says Dr. Dendy Engelman, a Manhattan dermatologist. “They’re like, ‘Maybe she’ll listen to you because she certainly doesn’t listen to me.’”\nMia’s mother, Sandra Gordon, took a different approach. Last spring, she noticed dark patches on Mia’s face and became alarmed. Gordon, a nurse, threw all her daughter’s products into the trash.\n“There were Sephora bags on top of bags. Some things were opened, some not opened, some were full. I got rid of them all,” she says.\nMia wasn’t happy. But as she starts high school, she now feels her mother was right. She has switched to a simple routine, using just a face wash and moisturizer, and says her complexion has improved.\nIn Sacramento, California, Scarlett missed early signs the products were hurting her skin: She developed a rash and felt a stinging sensation, within days of trying out viral skin care products. Scarlett figured she wasn’t using enough, so she layered on more. That’s when her cheeks erupted in blistering pain.\n“It was late at night. She came running into my room crying. All of her cheeks had been burned,” recalls Anna Goddard, Scarlett’s mother, who hadn’t realized the extent of Scarlett’s skin care obsession.\nWhen Goddard read the ingredients in each product, she was shocked to find retinol in products that appeared to be marketed to children — including a facial sheet mask with a cat’s face on the packaging.\nWhat worries her mother most is the psychological consequences. Kids’ comments at school have caused lingering anxiety and self-consciousness.\nGoddard hopes to see more protections. “I didn’t know there were harmful ingredients being put in skin care that is marketed to kids,” she says. “There has to be some type of warning.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

These families are navigating adolescence offline\nWESTPORT, Conn. (AP) — Kate Bulkeley’s pledge to stay off social media in high school worked at first. She watched the benefits pile up: She was getting excellent grades. She read lots of books. The family had lively conversations around the dinner table and gathered for movie nights on weekends.\nThen, as sophomore year got underway, the unexpected problems surfaced. She missed a student government meeting arranged on Snapchat. Her Model U.N. team communicates on social media, too, causing her scheduling problems. Even the Bible Study club at her Connecticut high school uses Instagram to communicate with members.\nGabriela Durham, a high school senior in Brooklyn, says navigating high school without social media has made her who she is today. She is a focused, organized, straight-A student with a string of college acceptances — and an accomplished dancer who recently made her Broadway debut. Not having social media has made her an “outsider,” in some ways. That used to hurt; now, she says, it feels like a badge of honor.\nWith the damaging consequences of social media increasingly well documented, some parents are trying to raise their children with restrictions or blanket bans. Teenagers themselves are aware that too much social media is bad for them, and some are initiating social media “cleanses” because of the toll it takes on mental health and grades.\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\nBut it is hard to be a teenager today without social media. For those trying to stay off social platforms while most of their peers are immersed, the path can be challenging, isolating and at times liberating. It can also be life-changing.\nThis is a tale of two families, social media and the ever-present challenge of navigating high school. It’s about what kids do when they can’t extend their Snapstreaks or shut their bedroom doors and scroll through TikTok past midnight. It’s about what families discuss when they’re not having screen-time battles. It’s also about persistent social ramifications.\nAP correspondent Jocelyn Gecker reports on the social ramifications some families saw for their teenagers after cutting out social media.\nThe journeys of both families show the rewards and pitfalls of trying to avoid social media in a world that is saturated by it.\nA FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE\nConcerns about children and phone use are not new. But there is a growing realization among experts that the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed adolescence. As youth coped with isolation and spent excessive time online, the pandemic effectively carved out a much larger space for social media in the lives of American kids.\nNo longer just a distraction or a way to connect with friends, social media has matured into a physical space and a community that almost all U.S. teenagers belong to. Up to 95% of teenagers say they use social media, with more than one-third saying they are on it “almost constantly,” according to the Pew Research Center.\nMore than ever, teenagers live in a seamless digital and non-digital world in ways that most adults don’t recognize or understand, says Michael Rich, a pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School and head of the nonprofit Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital.\n“Social media is now the air kids breathe,” says Rich, who runs the hospital’s Clinic for Interactive Media and Internet Disorders.\nFor better or worse, social media has become a home-base for socializing. It’s where many kids turn to forge their emerging identities, to seek advice, to unwind and relieve stress. It impacts how kids dress and talk. In this era of parental control apps and location tracking, social media is where this generation is finding freedom.\nIt is also increasingly clear that the more time youth spend online, the higher the risk of mental health problems.\nKids who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety, according to studies cited by U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who issued an extraordinary public warning last spring about the risks of social media to young people.\nThose were the concerns of the Bulkeleys and Gabriela’s mother, Elena Romero. Both set strict rules starting when their kids were young and still in elementary school. They delayed giving phones until middle school and made social media off limits until 18. They educated the girls, and their younger siblings, on the impact of social media on young brains, on online privacy concerns, on the dangers of posting photos or comments that can come back to haunt you.\nIn the absence of social media, at least in these two homes, there is a noticeable absence of screen time battles. But the kids and parents agree: It’s not always easy.\nWHEN IT’S EVERYWHERE, IT’S HARD TO AVOID\nAt school, on the subway and at dance classes around New York City, Gabriela is surrounded by reminders that social media is everywhere — except on her phone.\nGrowing up without it has meant missing out on things. Everyone but you gets the same jokes, practices the same TikTok dances, is up on the latest viral trends. When Gabriela was younger, that felt isolating; at times, it still does. But now, she sees not having social media as freeing.\n“From my perspective, as an outsider,” she says, “it seems like a lot of kids use social media to promote a facade. And it’s really sad. Because social media is telling them how they should be and how they should look. It’s gotten to a point where everyone wants to look the same instead of being themselves.”\nThere is also friend drama on social media and a lack of honesty, humility and kindness that she feels lucky to be removed from.\nGabriela is a dance major at the Brooklyn High School of the Arts and dances outside of school seven days a week. Senior year got especially intense, with college and scholarship applications capped by an unexpected highlight of getting to perform at Broadway’s Shubert Theatre in March as part of a city showcase of high school musicals.\nAfter a recent Saturday afternoon dance class in a Bronx church basement, the diverging paths between Gabriela and her peers is on full display. The other dancers, aged 11 to 16, sit cross-legged on the linoleum floor talking about social media.\n“I am addicted,” says 15-year-old Arielle Williams, who stays up late scrolling through TikTok. “When I feel like I’m getting tired I say, ‘One more video.’ And then I keep saying, ‘One more video.’ And I stay up sometimes until 5 a.m.”\nThe other dancers gasp. One suggests they all check their phones’ weekly screen time.\n“OH. MY,” says Arielle, staring at her screen. “My total was 68 hours last week.” That included 21 hours on TikTok.\nGabriela sits on the sidelines of the conversation, listening silently. But on the No. 2 subway home to Brooklyn, she shares her thoughts. “Those screen-time hours, it’s insane.”\nAs the train rumbles from the elevated tracks in the Bronx into the underground subway tunnels in Manhattan, Gabriela is on her phone. She texts with friends, listens to music and consults a subway app to count down the stops to her station in Brooklyn. The phone for her is a distraction limited to idle time, which has been strategically limited by Romero.\n“My kids’ schedules will make your head spin,” Romero says as the family reconvenes Saturday night in their three-bedroom walkup in Bushwick. On school days, they’re up at 5:30 a.m. and out the door by 7. Romero drives the girls to their three schools scattered around Brooklyn, then takes the subway into Manhattan, where she teaches mass communications at the Fashion Institute of Technology.\nGrace, 11, is a sixth grade cheerleader active in Girl Scouts, along with Gionna, 13, who sings, does debate team and has daily rehearsals for her middle school theater production.\n“I’m so booked my free time is to sleep,” says Gabriela, who tries to be in bed by 10:30 p.m.\nIn New York City, it’s common for kids to get phones early in elementary school, but Romero waited until each daughter reached middle school and started taking public transportation home alone. Years ago, she sat them down to watch “The Social Dilemma,” a documentary that Gabriela says made her realize how tech companies manipulate their users.\nHer mom’s rules are simple: No social media on phones until 18. The girls are allowed to use YouTube on their computers but not post videos. Romero doesn’t set screen-time limits or restrict phone use in bedrooms.\n“It’s a struggle, don’t get me wrong,” Romero says. Last year, the two younger girls “slipped.” They secretly downloaded TikTok for a few weeks before getting caught and sternly lectured.\nRomero is considering whether to bend her rule for Gionna, an avid reader interested in becoming a Young Adult “Bookstagrammer” — a book reviewer on Instagram. Gionna wants to be a writer when she grows up and loves the idea that reviewers get books for free.\nHer mother is torn. Romero’s main concern was social media during middle school, a critical age where kids are forming their identity. She supports the idea of using social media responsibly as a tool to pursue passions.\n“When you’re a little older,” she tells her girls, “you’ll realize Mom was not as crazy as you thought.”\nSTRUGGLING NOT TO MISS OUT\nIn the upscale suburb of Westport, Connecticut, the Bulkeleys have faced similar questions about bending their rules. But not for the reason they had anticipated.\nKate was perfectly content to not have social media. Her parents had figured at some point she might resist their ban because of peer pressure or fear of missing out. But the 15-year-old sees it as a waste of time. She describes herself as academic, introverted and focused on building up extracurricular activities.\nThat’s why she needed Instagram.\n“I needed it to be co-president of my Bible Study Club,” Kate explains, seated with her family in the living room of their two-story home.\nAs Kate’s sophomore year started, she told her parents that she was excited to be leading a variety of clubs but needed social media to do her job. They agreed to let her have Instagram for her afterschool activities, which they found ironic and frustrating. “It was the school that really drove the fact that we had to reconsider our rule about no social media,” says Steph Bulkeley, Kate’s mother.\nSchools talk the talk about limiting screen time and the dangers of social media, says Kate’s dad, Russ Bulkeley. But technology is rapidly becoming part of the school day. Kate’s high school and their 13-year-old daughter Sutton’s middle school have cell phone bans that aren’t enforced. Teachers will ask students to take out their phones to photograph material during class time.\nThe Bulkeleys aren’t on board with that, but feel powerless to change it. When their girls were still in elementary school, the Bulkeleys were inspired by the “Wait Until 8th” pledge, which encourages parents to wait to give children smartphones, and access to social media, until at least 8th grade or about age 13. Some experts say waiting until 16 is better. Others feel banning social media isn’t the answer, and that kids need to learn to live with the technology because it’s not going anywhere.\nUltimately they gave in to Kate’s plea because they trust her, and because she’s too busy to devote much time to social media.\nBoth Kate and Sutton wrap up afterschool activities that include theater and dance classes at 8:30 p.m. most weeknights. They get home, finish homework and try to be in bed by 11.\nKate spends an average of two hours a week on her phone. That is significantly less than most, according to a 2023 Gallup poll that found over half of U.S. teens spend an average of five hours each day on social media. She uses her phone mainly to make calls, text friends, check grades and take photos. She doesn’t post or share pictures, one of her parents’ rules. Others: No phones allowed in bedrooms. All devices stay on a ledge between the kitchen and living room. TV isn’t allowed on school nights.\nKate has rejected her parents’ offer to pay her for waiting to use social media. But she is embarking slowly on the apps. She has set a six-minute daily time limit as a reminder not to dawdle on Instagram.\nHaving the app came in handy earlier this year at a Model UN conference where students from around the world exchanged contact details: “Nobody asked for phone numbers. You gave your Instagram,” Kate says. She is resisting Snapchat, for fear she will find it addictive. She has asked a friend on student government to text her any important student government messages sent on Snapchat.\nSutton feels the weight of not having social media more than her older sister. The eighth grader describes herself as social but not popular.\n“There’s a lot of popular girls that do a bunch of TikTok dances. That’s really what determines your popularity: TikTok,” Sutton says.\nKids in her grade are “obsessed with TikTok” and posting videos of themselves that look to her like carbon copies. The girls look the same in short crop tops and jeans and sound the same, speaking with a TikTok dialect that includes a lot of “Hey, guys!” and uptalk, their voices rising in tone at the end of a thought.\nShe feels left out at times but doesn’t feel the need to have social media, since one of her friends sends her the latest viral videos. She has seen firsthand the problems social media can cause in friend groups. “Two of my friends were having a fight. One thought the other one blocked her on Snapchat.”\nThere’s a long way to go before these larger questions are resolved, with these two families and across the nation. Schools are trying. Some are banning phones entirely to hold students’ focus and ensure that socializing happens face-to-face. It might, educators say, also help cut back on teen depression and anxiety.\nThat’s something Sutton can understand at age 13 as she works to navigate the years ahead. From what she has seen, social media has changed in the past few years. It used to be a way for people to connect, to message and to get to know each other.\n“It’s kind of just about bragging now,” she says. “People post pictures of their trips to amazing places. Or looking beautiful. And it makes other people feel bad about themself.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Get off your phone.\nKids constantly hear about the downsides of social media from the adults in their lives, often in the form of dire warnings and commands. But these adults did not grow up with social media themselves.\nThey didn’t get a phone handed to them as toddlers, just to keep them quiet in a restaurant. They didn’t join TikTok’s predecessor Musica.ly and do silly dances before they even learned to read. They didn’t have their schools shut down in a global pandemic, their connections to friends and peers relegated to phone and computer screens.\nKids coming of age with social media are forging ahead in a whole new world. And now that they are getting older, they have some advice for their younger peers.\nHere’s what they wish they knew when they first got online.\nYou don’t have to share everything\n“It’s so easy to look at your friends’ stories and feel this feeling of FOMO, of missing out and comparing yourself, like: ‘Oh, my friend just got a new car.’ It’s like this overwhelming sense of comparison. But the things that people post on social media, it’s just the highlight reel, like the 1% of their life that they want to showcase to other people.”\nBAO LE, 18, a freshman at Vanderbilt University\nThis article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.\nDon’t take it too seriously\n“My main point of advice would be not to take it too seriously. Be yourself. I feel like what I was exposed to as a 12-year-old was much more limited than what is accessible to 12–year-olds nowadays. Younger kids want to be who they idolize. And when the TikTok stars or the social media stars are 20, 18, 16, they’re going to want to be like them. You’re getting younger kids that are now obsessing over products and brands, and it’s just getting really hard to be young. And it shouldn’t be really hard to be young. You should be enjoying childhood. And we shouldn’t be rushing to grow up. It’s OK to be 12. It’s OK to be young. It’s OK to enjoy childhood.”\nDOREEN MALATA, 22, a senior at the University of Maryland\nHow addictive it is\n“It seems like it would be really easy to just put your phone down and stop scrolling. But it is not. If there was advice that I could give to my younger self, it would be to tell my parents to set up time limits for me — even though I would have never said that when I was starting social media. Also, I personally would not let my kid have TikTok. I would try to resist it as long as I could. It’s so addictive.”\nSIENNA KEENE, 17, a high school senior in Orinda, California\nTake a social media detox\n“When you first get these apps, it hits you — like, BOOM, there is so much content. Styles, fashion models. It really impacts you heavily when you first get it, this feeling of: ‘How do they do it? How do they look like this? How do they get clothes like that?’ When you’re new to social media, these trends can overtake you. I started to use screentime (monitoring) on my phone and limit the amount of time I am on social media. I’ve been taking phone detoxes. On weekends, I’ll take a social media detox for 10 hours or the majority of the day. I’ll hang out with my family, ride my bike. I only have notifications for my messages and workspaces. I don’t have any notifications on for social media apps.”\nAVA HAVIDIC, 18, a high school senior in Broward County, Florida\nYou are the one in control\n“Often I hear the term “social media user,” but I felt like I was being used by social media. I had this routine of scrolling mindlessly through TikTok, just scrolling and scrolling and comparing myself to other people. It ultimately really affected my body image, my perception of what was considered beautiful or accepted into society. But the only thing I was getting out of social media was feeling fatigued, or I would feel sad.\nYou can use social media to amplify your passions, but in order to do that you need to do a lot of work outside of social media, to discover who you are as a person, what matters to you and what contributions you can make to the world.”\nLEA NEPOMUCENO, 18, a freshman at George Washington University\nIt’s a waste of time\n“I would say just don’t use it. It’s kind of a waste of time. You’re just having conversations about pointless things, random pop culture stuff. It just sucks your time. You’re not really getting anything out of it, just short-term satisfaction. It’s kind of meaningless. I know this is kind of outlandish, but I feel like there should be some sort of age limit because I don’t think children should be on the internet.”\nMIKAEL MAKONNEN, 18, a freshman at American University\nA lot of it is not real\n“A lot of people make their life artificial so that they’re perceived in a certain way. And I think going into social media, I wish I knew it is a tool to learn from. There’s so much information, and you’re able to learn so much about different things. ... I wish people had that outlook rather than the whole idea of other people viewing you and having to be seen a certain way.”\nNOUR MAHMOUD, 21, a junior at Virginia Commonwealth University\nIt’s OK to put up boundaries and block someone\n“You can’t scroll on TikTok or look through Instagram without seeing supermodels who have edited their photos and are promoting unrealistic beauty standards. I don’t want to see these girls who pretend to be fitness influencers but are just promoting an eating disorder like “body checking” on my feed. That is one thing I wish I knew when I started: that it is OK to not want to look at that or want to consume it. It’s OK to protect yourself and your own body image. Another thing I wish I knew is that not everyone on social media is your friend. When you are young and impressionable and people are reaching out to you, just know that not everyone is as friendly as you think they are.”\nMADELEINE MAESTRE, 18, a freshman at Santa Clara University\n__\nInterviews by Almaz Abedje, Jocelyn Gecker and Barbara Ortutay",

    "body": "A realistic way to protect kids from social media? Find a middle ground\nA realistic way to protect kids from social media? Find a middle ground\nAhmed Othman isn’t on TikTok and doesn’t want to be.\nHe and his younger sister got iPhones when they were in eighth and seventh grade respectively, but with no social media, just iMessage. Their parents, who are both computer scientists, spent the next year teaching them about social media, bombarding them with studies about its effects on teen mental health.\n“They really tried to emphasize social media is a tool, but can also be like your worst enemy if you so make it,” Othman said.\nNow 17, Othman credits his parents’ deep involvement for what he calls a “healthy relationship” with his phone. That includes staying away from TikTok.\n“The algorithm is so potent that I feel like, you know, TikTok might not benefit me,” he said.\nOthman, who’s originally from Libya and lives in Massachusetts, is an outlier among his peers, nearly two-thirds of whom are on TikTok either with or without their parents’ permission, according to the Pew Research Center.\nOthman’s parents took a middle ground approach that a growing number of experts say is the most realistic and effective way of teaching children about social media: Rather than an outright ban or allowing free reign, they recommend a slow, deliberate onboarding that gives children the tools and information they need to navigate a world in which places like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat are almost impossible to escape.\n“You cannot just expect that the kids will jump into the world of social media, learn how to swim on their own,” said Natalie Bazarova, a professor of communications and director of the Cornell Social Media Lab. “They need to have instruction. They need to have practice on how to behave on social media. They need to have understanding of risks and opportunities. And they also need to learn that in a way that is age appropriate.”\nFEW GUARDRAILS\nThe harms to children from social media have been well-documented in the two decades since Facebook’s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially when they are tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies — though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship.\nMany are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends could send them into a negative spiral.\nLawmakers have taken notice and have held multiple congressional hearings — most recently in January — on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook’s founding.\nLast May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning saying there is not enough evidence to show that social media is safe for kids and urged policymakers to address the harms of social media the same way they regulate things like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use. Parents, he stressed, can’t do it all, although some — like Othman’s — try.\nOthman at first wanted a phone “with everything on it, no restrictions.”\n“But like now, after the years passed, I really do understand and appreciate what they did,” he said.\nWHEN IT’S NOT ENOUGH\nOf course, the Othmans’ approach may not work for every family. Most parents are not computer scientists, and many don’t have the time or expertise to create a crash-course on social media for their children.\nBut even when parents are vigilant, that’s still no guarantee their children won’t fall prey to social media’s traps.\nNeveen Radwan thought she did everything right when she gave her children phones: putting restrictions on their accounts, having access to their passwords, taking away their phones at night, setting everything to private.\n“I made sure that everything was very, very, you know, airtight,” said Radwan, who worked in information technology for 20 years.\nHer daughter didn’t get a phone until she was 13. She started using social media in the eighth grade. When she was 16, she was diagnosed with anorexia.\n“We were right in the beginning of (the COVID lockdowns) and it progressed very quickly because we were at home and she was on social media quite a bit at the time,” Radwan recalled.\nAn avid athlete, the teen started looking for workouts and ways to stay healthy on Instagram. Soon, though, the algorithm began showing her social media challenges like “how to stay under 500 calories a day” and “if you want to stay skinny, you need to be able to fit in a baby swing.” Within two or three months, Radwan said her daughter was in the hospital.\nToday, Radwan speaks about the harms of social media to teens and has joined a lawsuit against Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. that seeks to hold the tech giant accountable for the harms its platforms have caused to children and teens. Her daughter has recovered and is attending college.\nARE SCHOOLS THE ANSWER?\nWhile parents are definitely part of the equation, most of the the teens and experts interviewed by The Associated Press pointed to schools as the key place where all children can learn about “digital citizenship,” the umbrella term that includes news media literacy, cyberbullying, social media balance and now even artificial intelligence literacy.\n“We have sex education. We don’t have things about like online safety,” said Bao Le, a 18-year-old freshman at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. “And a lot of kids are dying of suicide, you know, text sextortion. So I think it’s really important the school also teaches this.”\nBut while some schools offer digital literacy or online safety programs, these are still few and far between. Teachers already face pressure to teach the regular curriculum while also dealing with staffing shortages and funding issues. Not only that, but kids are often encouraged to be on social media if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and other school programs.\nSome schools opt to ban phones altogether, but just as with parental bans, kids often find a way. For instance, at schools that collect the gadgets from kids in the morning, students say they get around it by turning in fake phones. To get around parental bans, they set up social media accounts on friends’ phones, computers or buy burner phones to keep using after they have turned in their official phone.\n“Hope is not a strategy. And pretending that (social media) doesn’t exist is also not a strategy, because we have to deal with real life,” said Merve Lapus, vice president of education outreach at the nonprofit Common Sense Media, whose digital citizenship curriculum is used in more than 90,000 schools in the U.S. “Our kids are being exposed to it in some shape or form. They’re hearing about it with their friends. The pressure to feel connected has not changed. I mean, these are all pressures we felt as kids.”\nTo really connect with kids, he said, it’s best to get deeper into the pressures they face when it comes to social media, and validate that those are real pressures.\n“I think that’s one of the challenges right now, is that it becomes the center of attention only when it’s problematic,” Lapus said. “And so we frame these tools as only problematic tools very easily, very quickly, and our kids will say, you just don’t get it, I can’t talk to you about these things because you don’t understand.”\nNONPROFITS STEP UP\nOver the past decade or so, nonprofits and advocacy groups — many run by young people who emerged from their own struggles with social media — have popped up to offer help.\nLarissa May stumbled on to social media a decade ago when she was in high school “without any roadmap” on its dangers or how to use it. May said she was dealing with depression and anxiety that social media exacerbated. In college, she became “obsessed” with social media and digital marketing, running a fashion blog where she was posting on every day.\n“I got to a point where I was spending 12-plus hours a day on my phone in my room, more focused on my digital identity than the world around me, my mental health, my physical health, my sleep,” May recalled. She almost took her own life.\nThe turning point came when May started going to a psychiatrist almost every day, with clear instructions of what she needed to do: Take antidepressants, start moving her body sleep, and start socializing.\n“However, I was spending all of my day on my phone, which they never addressed, and being on my phone prevented me from doing all of those things,” May said. “And it wasn’t until one day where I had this, you know, midnight thought of, why can I not heal? And it was because I hadn’t healed my relationship with technology.”\nSo, she shut down her fashion blog and started HalfTheStory in 2015, with the intent of gathering stories from young people such as Othman to understand how social media was affecting them.\n“And what I found out was that I wasn’t alone in my struggle,” she said.\nToday, HalfTheStory works with young people to build better relationships with technology, on their own terms, starting in middle school even before some kids have a device.\nTo May, abstinence is not the answer to teens’ problems with social media.\n“What I learn from every single one of our teens is that they wish their parents had more boundaries for them,” she said. “And I think that parents feel afraid because honestly, a lot of violence and conflict erupts around devices.”",

    "body": "Microsoft pushes AI updates in Windows 11 as it ends support for Windows 10\nMicrosoft is encouraging people to talk to their laptops as it rolls out new artificial intelligence updates to Windows 11 and pushes users to phase out its predecessor, Windows 10.\nMicrosoft ended free security support for Windows 10 this week, though millions of people still use personal computers running the older operating system.\nTo entice people to upgrade, the software giant on Thursday announced new Windows 11 features, most of them further integrating the company’s AI chatbot, Copilot, into the experience of using a laptop.\nAmong the features is a voice mode that enables users to dictate “Hey, Copilot” to start chatting with their computer instead of typing or clicking a touchpad.\nMicrosoft first introduced Windows 10 a decade ago and launched its successor, Windows 11, in 2021.\nBut many people around the world still are using Windows 10, particularly those with older computers that can’t upgrade to Windows 11. Consumer advocates have spent months petitioning Microsoft to extend technical support for an estimated hundreds of millions of devices that will no longer get automatic security fixes.\n“With the end of Windows 10, users face the choice between exposing themselves to cyberattacks or discarding their old computers and buying new ones,” said Brenna Stevens of the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, which advocated on behalf of local repair shops, students and others.\nMicrosoft has said people can pay extra for a year of extended security support through October 2026. Some users, including those in the European Union as well as U.S. users who can synchronize with Microsoft’s cloud service, will be able to get that extended support for free.\nBut most people faced with unsupported devices are likely to either keep using them despite the vulnerabilities or throw them away, which “creates both a security problem and an environmental problem,” generating huge amounts of toxic electronic waste, said Nathan Proctor, who leads PIRG’s Right to Repair campaign. Both PIRG and Microsoft urge those who are replacing their computers to avoid sending their older models to the landfill.\nThose concerns were not a focus of Microsoft’s Windows 11 announcements Thursday. Instead, Yusuf Mehdi, an executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Microsoft’s consumer division, argued that conversing with a laptop will be “as transformative as the mouse and keyboard” in shaping the PC experience. Microsoft says all Windows 11 users will also now have access to Copilot Vision, an AI feature that can analyze and give feedback on the documents, video games and other activities happening on the screen.\nMehdi acknowledged it could take some adjustment to get used to human-computer conversations in shared workspaces.\n“Just like when the mouse came out, people have to figure out when to use it, what’s the right way, how to make it happen,” Mehdi told reporters.\nThe updates are Microsoft’s latest attempt to make its widely used Windows operating system a gateway to hook people on its suite of generative AI tools. The tech giant competes heavily on AI services with Apple, Google and startups like Anthropic and OpenAI.\nMehdi said the updates are “not a replacement for Recall,” a screen-tracking feature on some Windows computers that gives Copilot a “photographic memory” of a user’s virtual activity. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described it last year as a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” but the idea was met with criticism from privacy and security experts and took a year before it started to roll out.",

    "body": "Energy Department offers $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade transmission lines across Midwest\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.\nAEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.\nOhio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.\nThursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.\nEarlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.\nThe cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.\nThe loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.\nThe project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.\n“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,’' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”\nThe upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.\nMore than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.\nThe projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.\nThe loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.\nWright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.\nThe Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.\n“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.\nTrump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.\nThe loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.\n“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",

    "body": "US prosecutors charge Smartmatic in alleged $1M Philippines bribery case\nMIAMI (AP) — Federal prosecutors have charged voting technology firm Smartmatic with money laundering and other crimes arising from more than $1 million in bribes that several executives allegedly paid to election officials in the Philippines.\nThe payments, between 2015 and 2018, were made to obtain a contract with the Philippines government to help run that country’s 2016 presidential election and secure the timely payment for its work, according to a superseding indictment filed Thursday in a Florida federal court.\nThree former executives of Smartmatic, including co-founder Roger Pinate, were previously charged in 2024 but at the time South Florida-based Smartmatic was not named as a defendant. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic but remains a shareholder, has pleaded not guilty.\nThe criminal case is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox News of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump.\nSmartmatic in a statement denied the allegations and said it believed the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami had been misled and politically influenced by unnamed powerful interests.\n“This is again, targeted, political, and unjust,” the company said. “Smartmatic will continue to stand by its people and principles. We will not be intimidated by those pulling the strings of power.”\nAs part of the criminal case, prosecutors in August sought the court’s permission to introduce evidence they argue shows that revenue from a $300 million contract with Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a “ slush fund” controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.\nThey also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela’s longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic’s abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro ’s government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.\nA hearing on the purported evidence tied to Los Angeles and Venezuela will be held next month however none of the accusations are mentioned in the superseding indictment signed by Jason Reding Quinones, the new Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\nSmartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success running elections while the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting, was in power. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.\nBut Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave Trump’s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.\nFox said it was legitimately reporting on newsworthy events but eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic’s lawyers complained. Nonetheless, it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York — arguing that the company was facing imminent collapse over its own internal misconduct, not due to any negative coverage.",

    "body": "Susan Stamberg, first woman to host a national news program, dies at age 87\nSusan Stamberg, first woman to host a national news program, dies at age 87\nSusan Stamberg, a “founding mother” of National Public Radio and the first female broadcaster to host a national news program, has died. She was 87.\nStamberg died Thursday, NPR reported. It did not provide a cause of death.\nStamberg joined NPR in the early 1970s when it was getting off the ground as a network of radio stations across the country. During her career, she interviewed thousands of people, from prominent politicians and artists to the less well-known like White House chefs and people who work behind the scenes in Hollywood.\nShe explained in an oral history interview with Oregon station KLCC in January that she didn’t have women in broadcast to model herself after when she became the host of “All Things Considered” in 1972.\n“The only ones on were men, and the only thing I knew to do was imitate them,” she said.\nShe lowered her voice to sound authoritative. After a few days, Bill Siemering, the program manager, told her to be herself.\n“And that was new too in its day, because everybody else, the women, were trained actors, and so they came with a very careful accents and very careful delivery. They weren’t relaxed and natural,” she said. “So we made a new sound with radio as well, with NPR.”\nNPR’s obituary for Stamberg quoted her colleague Jack Mitchell saying she had an “obvious New York accent.”\n“All Things Considered” only had five reporters to draw on while they filled their 90-minute program, creating a daily challenge.\nShe told KLCC that she coined the term “founding mother” to refer to herself and three other women who helped launch the NPR: Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and Linda Wertheimer.\n“I got tired of hearing about Founding Fathers, and I knew we were not that, so we were obviously Founding Mothers, and I was going to put that on the map,” she said.\nStamberg hosted “All Things Considered” for 14 years. She went on to host “Weekend Edition Sunday,” where she started the Sunday puzzle feature with Will Shortz.\nShortz, who continues to serve as the program’s puzzle master and who is now the crossword editor of the New York Times, explained that Stamberg wanted the show to be the radio equivalent of a Sunday newspaper that provided news, culture, sports and a puzzle.\nShe later became a cultural correspondent for “Morning Edition” and “Weekend Edition Saturday.” She retired in September.\nIn 1979, she hosted a two-hour radio call-in program with then-President Jimmy Carter from the Oval Office. She managed the listeners who called in to speak with him. The questions were not screened beforehand. It was the second time Carter had a call-in program after the first with Walter Cronkite.\nStamberg was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, which said she was known for her “conversational style, intelligence, and knack for finding an interesting story.” She interviewed Nancy Reagan, Annie Liebowitz, Rosa Parks and James Baldwin, among thousands of others.\nShe received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2020.\nStamberg was born Susan Levitt in Newark, New Jersey, in 1938 but grew up in Manhattan. She met her husband, Louis Stamberg, while working in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nShe is survived by her son, Josh Stamberg, and her granddaughters, Vivian and Lena.",

    "body": "Honolulu police could start using AI to write reports\nHonolulu police officers could soon be using artificial intelligence to help write reports, a move that the department says could free up cops to spend more time patrolling their beats, but critics say could damage the integrity of the state’s criminal justice system.\nThe idea is still in its early stages, but the department could pilot a program by the end of this year or next spring, Honolulu police interim Chief Rade Vanic said during Wednesday’s Honolulu Police Commission meeting.\nThe department would use a product offered by Axon, the Honolulu Police Department’s body camera vendor. The product uses audio transcripts and visuals from body camera footage to generate police reports.\nVanic said if HPD starts to use this technology, officers would still be required to review the reports and do things like add headings.\n“They still have to have human input,” Vanic told commissioners.\nWhile other police departments around the country are already using this technology, the concept is controversial, with groups like the ACLU of Hawaiʻi opposing it.\n“AI technology is just too unreliable, untested, biased and also opaque,” said Wookie Kim, legal director at the ACLU of Hawaiʻi. “It’s not yet ready to be infused into one of the most important parts of the criminal legal system, which is the police report.”\nOnly one of the police commissioners raised concerns about the proposal during the meeting.\nChristopher Magnus, who was confirmed earlier this month and served as police chief in three mainland cities, encouraged Vanic to get input from the public before moving forward with the idea.\n“The use of AI,” he said, “is fraught with controversy and a variety of issues.”\nThe Pros And Cons\nVanic touted the concept as a way to help officers save time on report writing.\n“That’s the reality of the job now is how much typing there actually is,” he said.\nInstead of sitting parked on the side of the road spending 30-40 minutes writing up a report, an officer could be driving around his or her beat, talking to people in the community or conducting traffic stops, he said.\n“Doing what cops do instead of typing their report,” he said.\nCommissioner Laurie Foster said she read in a brochure on AI that officers spend 30-35% of their time on reports.\n“Think about that,” she said. “We’re 30% down on staffing.”\nAxon’s website claims its technology can cut an officer’s report writing time in half.\nThe technology “is a force multiplier for officers,” the site says, “leveraging generative AI and body-worn camera audio to produce high-quality draft report narratives in seconds.”\nBut Nicholas Schlapak, president of the state police union, urged caution in using AI to write reports. He said in a written statement that rushing to implement such a program “puts prosecutions at risk, officers’ jobs in jeopardy, and our department’s reputation on the line.”\nThe technology has been known to produce errors and even “hallucinate” information. Complaints have been filed against Hawaiʻi lawyers for using AI to write briefs that were later found to contain false information and cite fake cases.\nKim said AI can also have biases depending on how it is trained, and a program that is created for use by police officers could be trained to protect law enforcement officers rather than the public.\nHe also said police reports aren’t meant to be a completely objective or neutral accounting of an event, but to describe the officer’s perception of what happened.\nAI might pick up something in a video or audio clip and determine that it was threatening, even if the officer didn’t notice it or perceive it as a threat at the time, he said.\nAnother issue, he said, is that AI won’t have the context officers have when going into a call, such as a person’s background or mental health state.\n“Because police reports, they’re sort of the gateway to the criminal legal process and the criminal legal system, they’re just too important to delegate to artificial intelligence,” he said.\nHow It’s Being Used\nDepartments around the country are already using this technology, but only two states — Utah and California — require police departments to disclose publicly when officer reports are written using AI, according to The Conversation, a national nonprofit news organization.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom last week signed a law requiring law enforcement agencies to publicly disclose when AI is used to write a police report.\nVanic said the Honolulu Police Department also needs to come up with a policy on AI, which it doesn’t currently have.\n“I definitely think we need community input,” he said. “We definitely need to work with stakeholders, the judiciary, the prosecutor’s office. We’d want to get best practices.”\nHonolulu Prosecutor’s Office spokesperson Christine Denton said in an email that the office is in the early stages of researching the issue with the police department and it is too early to comment.\nVanic said the department may roll out an AI pilot project by the end of this year or next spring. He envisions it being used for lower-level reports at first, such as a car that was broken into overnight — not arrest reports or use-of-force reports.\nHe said he sees AI as a tool that can help officers be more efficient.\n“If we can use technology through body-worn cameras, through artificial intelligence, to help an officer do his or her job easier,” he said, “why not? Let’s do it.”\nSchlapak said any police AI program should be implemented with public review. The department should also look at various technology providers, not just settle with the vendor it is already using.\n“And there must be an accountability system for all parties involved before we even start the conversation,” he said in a written statement. “Anything else is a recipe for disaster.”\n___\nThis story was originally published by Honolulu Civil Beat and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

For Bucklew and McAdory, Innovate Mississippi’s accelerator has taught them how to grow their business.\n”Especially something that’s scalable to the level (SimpleScript) is, it can be difficult to figure out what to do next. We needed some counsel on how to get from point A to point B.” said Bucklew. “From working with CoBuilders we will be ready to get funding.”\nMississippi has a nascent tech scene and state leaders have struggled with how to grow it. Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit organization trying to connect entrepreneurs with investors and other resources across the state.\n“With 3 million people in Mississippi, we’ve gotta do a lot of work just to find the business that needs the mentor three hours away, that needs the accounting person,” said Tony Jeff, the CEO and president of Innovate. “We connect those dots.”\nJeff says that without this connection, founders would turn to other states for funding and resources.\nCoBuilders, Innovate’s 12-week startup accelerator, mentors and trains Mississippi entrepreneurs on how to get their company and product ready to show to investors. Innovate, which is funded through a mix of public and private money, also invests $25,000 into each company.\nThis year’s cohort of seven companies has been refining its products to pitch to investors on Nov. 11. On pitch day, they’ll be looking to raise upwards of $100,000 each. Unlike other small businesses, startups are focused on rapid growth and capturing a large share of a market.\nTo support this they usually rely on raising money from outside investors. In the early stages of a startup, companies often look to “angel investors,” wealthy individuals or groups that invest a small amount in a company.\nJeff said it’s not enough for founders to have a polished pitch, they need to have researched their competitors and received feedback from users.\nLeta Palmiter’s company, Vertical Take-Off Reading, is currently in its third pilot round and has over 130 students using it.\nThe software she created with co-founder Ben Stasa, measures students’ oral reading skills. As a speech therapist and executive director of a nonprofit that serves dyslexic students, Palmiter saw students needed one-on-one help with reading that teachers just didn’t have the time for. She looked for a tool to help her measure her students’ ability to read out loud but couldn’t find anything. So she decided to do it herself.\nVertical’s program can be used in a classroom or at home on any device with a microphone. A child reads out loud while the app records it then creates a report for the teacher to measure the student’s progress.\nReading out loud helps with comprehension and is especially important for students with dyslexia. Palmiter says that Vertical is designed to complement teaching, not replace it.\n“ We know that it’s doing a great job measuring that accuracy at that sound level and that kind of data will drive instruction,” said Palmiter.\nShe met Stasa, a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Southern Mississippi, who was tackling the same problem. Palmiter said that working together helped bring the product to market.\nMississippi’s colleges are playing an active role in growing the startup pipeline, funding research and fostering new ideas. Innovate works with universities to host pitch competitions and connect to founders.\n“ There’s a lot of resources that the schools and universities help support tech entrepreneurs,” said Ricky Romanek founder of ClaimTra, a healthcare analytics tool for hospitals and clinics to recover insurance claims.\nJeff says that students regularly tell him that they plan on leaving Mississippi because it lacks good job opportunities for them. While it’s a small slice of the economy, Jeff thinks the tech sector could play a role in addressing Mississippi’s brain drain problem.\n“ There are a slice of Mississippians that these are the best and most exciting ways for them to stay here, be gainfully employed, and even move people here,” said Jeff.\nIt can be difficult finding the right companies for the accelerator. They need to be innovative companies, often in the tech sector, that are early in development and have high growth potential.\n“It is very obvious we have more money chasing deals than we have deals. So we’ve got to get everything we can to make every startup qualified for that money,” said Jeff. That’s where Innovate comes in, nurturing home-grown companies and attracting new companies to Mississippi.\nRomanek has brought Innovate “ a couple other crazy ideas” before and is excited to contribute to Mississippi’s tech industry.\nRomanek said: “ I think there’s a huge startup potential in Mississippi that’s untapped. There’s a lot of great ideas. I don’t think they’re aware of all the resources that are available.”\n—-\nThis story was originally published by Mississippi Today and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

    "body": "Death of kidnapped South Korean student spurs talks with Cambodia to tackle online scams\nDeath of kidnapped South Korean student spurs talks with Cambodia to tackle online scams\nPHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodian and South Korean officials agreed Thursday to cooperate in combating online scams, after the death of a South Korean student who was reportedly forced to work in a scam center in Cambodia triggered public outrage in South Korea.\nA South Korean delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jina visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, for talks with officials, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.\nDuring the meeting, Kim urged Cambodia to take stronger action against online scam crimes as Hun Manet expressed regret over the student’s death and promised to make more efforts to defend the safety of South Korean nationals in Cambodia, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.\nHun Manet said on Telegram the two countries “will continue to strengthen our collaboration to prevent, suppress, and combat online scams more effectively.”\nA vast transnational industry\nCambodia’s online scam industry uses trafficked workers from various countries to target victims around the world. South Korean officials estimate that about 200,000 people, including some 1,000 South Koreans, are working at online scam sites in Cambodia.\nIn August the body of 22-year-old student Park Min-ho was discovered in a pickup truck in Cambodia’s southern Kampot province. Authorities said he died following a cardiac arrest after being tortured and beaten. South Korean media reported that Park was lured to travel to Cambodia by a friend, who was later arrested in South Korea.\nKim told reporters that she asked for Cambodia to repatriate South Koreans nationals involved in online scams in the country and return Park’s remains at an early date. South Korean officials earlier said the body’s return was delayed due to disputes over South Korea’s request for an autopsy by pathologists from both countries.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how those 1,000 South Koreans have ended up working in online scam sites in Cambodia. South Korean officials believe many were lured with promises of high-paying jobs before being forced to work against their will, but some also went there voluntarily.\nIn the first eight months of this year alone, there were reports of 330 South Koreans detained in Cambodia, South Korean national security adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing Wednesday, citing reports from victims themselves and their relatives. Wi said that 80% of those cases have been resolved.\nWi said 60 South Koreans were recently arrested in Cambodia on suspicion of involvement in online scams. Once repatriated, they would face investigation and possible legal punishments, depending on the degree of their involvement, Wi said.\nThe Cambodian National Police said in a statement Thursday that authorities were working with the South Korean Embassy in Cambodia to repatriate 59 South Koreans on Friday.\nSouth Korea imposes travel restrictions\nOn Thursday, a South Korean travel ban came into effect for parts of Cambodia, including Bokor Mountain in Kampot province, where Park Min-ho was found dead, as well as the towns of Bavet and Poipet, on Cambodia’s border with Vietnam and Thailand.\nKim said Hun Manet asked South Korea to ease the travel restrictions, citing worries about the possible negative effect on investments and tourism in Cambodia. Kim said she described the restrictions as “inevitable” but South Korea will ease them if the situation improves.\nWi said earlier Thursday there would be a limit in South Korea to dealing solely with a transnational online scam industry based in a foreign country. But he said South Korea will mobilize “all available methods” to protect the safety and properties of South Koreans and promote coordination with Cambodia, neighboring countries and international organizations.\nHun Manet said “Cambodia does not need any neighboring country to carry out such work on its behalf” to address online scam issues and that the two countries can resolve the matter bilaterally without the need for any third-party involvement.\nThe United Nations and other agencies have estimated that cyberscams, most of them originating from Southeast Asia, earn international criminal gangs billions of dollars annually. The cybercriminals pretend friendship or tout phony investment opportunities to cheat their targets around the world.\nJeremy Douglas, former regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, now current chief of staff for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said that Southeast Asia — particularly the Mekong Region’s border areas between Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand — is “arguably the most significant global hub for scams and illegal online gaming. And the reason is pretty straightforward — criminals like the conditions, the freedom they have, the ability to make and hide money with little resistance.”\n“It is unclear how governments will respond, but the main thing now is pulling together on a regional solution. The situation can’t simply be ignored,” Douglas said.\n___\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea. Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Anton L.

    "body": "Colleges are fighting to prove their return on investment\nWASHINGTON (AP) — For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college — or whether to go at all — has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?\nPublic confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market — plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.\nBorrowed from the business world, the term “return on investment” has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.\n“Students are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn’t pay off,” said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “It’s front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.”\nMost bachelor’s degrees are still worth it\nA wide body of research indicates a bachelor’s degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there’s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.\nA new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years — meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.\nIt’s a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school’s students come from low-income families, and many aren’t willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.\nInstead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.\n“A lot of families are just saying they can’t afford it, or they don’t want to go into debt for years and years and years,” she said.\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.\n“I’m not saying kids shouldn’t go to college,” she said. “I’m just saying all kids don’t have to go in order to be successful.”\nLowering college tuition and improving graduate earnings\nAmerican higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation — tuition costs and graduate earnings. It’s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.\nTuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.\nThe other part of the equation — making sure graduates land good jobs — is more complicated.\nA group of college presidents recently met at Gallup’s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren’t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.\n“We’re trying to get out in front of that,” he said.\nThe issue has been a priority for Guskiewicz since he arrived on campus last year. He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market’s needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.\nA disconnect with the job market\nBridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn’t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.\n“No programs are immune, and no schools are immune,” Sigelman said.\nThe federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama’s administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.\nA Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.\nOthers see transparency as a key solution.\nFor decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.\nLawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state’s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.\nThe data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don’t.\nColleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.\n“In uncertain times, students are even more focused — I would say rightly so — on what their job prospects are going to be,” he added. “So I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.”\n___\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "body": "The 2026-27 FAFSA application is live. Here’s what to know\nNEW YORK (AP) — The Free Application for Federal Student Aid for the 2026-27 school year has officially opened.\nDespite the U.S. government shutdown, the Education Department will continue to process the FAFSA.\nIf you plan to attend college next year, Jill Desjean, director of policy analysis at The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, recommends that you fill it out as soon as you can.\nIf it’s your first time applying, here’s what you need to know:\nHow does the FAFSA work?\nThe FAFSA is a free government application that uses students’ and their families’ financial information to determine whether they can get financial aid from the federal government to pay for college.\nThe application will send a student’s financial information to the schools they are interested in attending. The amount of financial aid a student receives depends on each institution.\nThe application is also used to determine eligibility for other federal student aid programs, like work-study and loans, as well as state and school aid. Sometimes, private, merit-based scholarships also require FAFSA information to determine if a student qualifies.\nWhat is the deadline to fill out the FAFSA?\nThe FAFSA application for the 2026-2027 must be submitted by June 30, 2027. However, each state has different deadlines for financial aid. For example, California has a March 2, 2026, deadline and Kansas has an April 15, 2026, deadline for state financial aid programs.\nYou can check your state’s deadline here.\nThis year’s application rolled out Sept. 24, a week ahead of the anticipated Oct. 1 launch.\n“This is a really welcomed change and hopefully it will be a turning point where we can expect to see a FAFSA every year by or even before October 1st,” Desjean said.\nHow can I prepare to fill out the FAFSA form?\nThe first step in the process is to create a studentaid.gov account and gather the following documents:\n— Social Security number\n— Driver’s license number\n— Alien registration number, if you are not a U.S. citizen\n— Federal income tax returns, W-2s and other records of money earned\n— Bank statements and records of investments\n— Records of untaxed income\nWho should fill out the FAFSA?\nAnyone planning to attend college next year should fill out the form. Both first-time college students and returning students can apply.\n“Even if you think you won’t qualify, the worst thing that can happen is that you might get finance aid you didn’t know you qualified for,” Desjean said.\nStudents and parents can use the federal student aid estimator to get an early approximation of their financial package.\nWhat information do I need from my parents?\nIf you are filing as a dependent student, you’ll need to provide the financial information of at least one parent. Parents need to create their own FSA IDs. When your parents fill out the application, they can manually input their tax return information or use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.\n——\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

    "body": "Hong Kong lawmakers pass bill to regulate ride-hailing services like Uber\nHONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong lawmakers passed a bill Wednesday to regulate online ride-hailing services, requiring platforms like Uber, along with their vehicles and drivers, to be licensed, after years of backlash from the city’s taxi industry.\nThe first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.\nIn granting a license, Hong Kong’s transport commissioner can consider the firm’s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region. Licensed companies will need to maintain “proper and efficient” services and ensure all vehicles and drivers on their platforms hold valid permits, according to the new rules.\nDrivers are required to be at least 21, have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. They also need to pass a test and take a pre-service course.\nThe bill marks an important step in the development of ride-hailing services in Hong Kong, which currently bans drivers of private vehicles from providing paid services to customers without a permit.\nUber Hong Kong welcomed the voting results. “This decision marks a significant milestone in integrating ridesharing into the city’s transport system and ensuring riders and drivers benefit from clear rules,” it said.\nPolice have previously arrested some Uber drivers suspected of driving without a permit and in 2018, more than two dozen drivers were fined.\nSome taxi companies have long resisted online platforms like Uber, seeing them as a threat to their business.\nUber, which started operating in Hong Kong in 2014, has faced multiple legal and regulatory challenges in its overseas expansion but remains popular in the Asian financial hub, where many residents are frustrated with what they describe as poor taxi services.\nOfficials proposed a cap on the number of vehicles offering ride-hailing services under the new rules, which will be specified in a subsidiary legislation next year. If that legislation is passed, they will invite applications for licenses.\nUber Hong Kong said it looked forward to “constructive discussions” on vehicle quota mechanisms.\nAnyone who operates a ride-hailing platform and provides services without a license will face a fine of up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars (about $128,600) and a maximum jail term of one year, according to the bill.\nA platform that arranges cars or drivers without valid permits to serve passengers could be punished by a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,286) per violation on a first conviction. For subsequent conviction, the maximum jail term would double, in addition to a higher fine.",

Tuesday’s announcement from Walmart just noted that the offering would be available “soon.”\nBut the partnership marks OpenAI’s latest expansion into online commerce. The company has recently launched similar offerings for Shopify and Etsy sellers.\nTeaming up with Walmart — the nation’s largest retailer — marks an even more sizeable leap for OpenAI in this space. And competing with the likes of Amazon and Google for purchase fees from digital shopping could be a new source of money for the company. OpenAI hasn’t made a profit and has relied on investors to back the costs of building and running its powerful AI systems.\nWhen announcing its Etsy and Shopify partnerships last month, OpenAI said it worked with payments company Stripe on the technical standards to enable purchases through its “Instant Checkout” system.\nSeparately, Walmart has worked to boost its own integration of AI across operations and its consumer-facing offerings in recent years. On Tuesday, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company pointed to its AI shopping assistant named Sparky, as well as other uses of AI technology at both Walmart and Sam’s Club. Members of Sam’s Club, which is owned by Walmart, will be able to shop through the coming ChatGPT offering, too — and Walmart has boasted its promotion of “AI literacy” for its employees.\n“AI is transforming everything we do, from smarter catalogs to faster delivery, and it only works if people trust it,” Daniel Danker, executive vice president of AI Acceleration, Product and Design at Walmart said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\nShares of Walmart were up nearly 5% as of market close Tuesday.",

    "body": "Foundations want to curb AI developers’ influence with $500 million aimed at centering human needs\nNEW YORK (AP) — Artificial intelligence is a matter of design — not destiny.\nThat’s the message from ten philanthropic foundations aiming to loosen the grip that the technology’s moneyed developers, fueled by an investing frenzy, hold over its evolution. Launched Tuesday under the name Humanity AI, the coalition is committing $500 million across the next five years to place human interests at the forefront of the technology’s rapid integration into daily life.\n“The future belongs to those who actively create it, and that shan’t be a few leaders in Silicon Valley. It’s all of us,” Mozilla Foundation Executive Director Nabiha Syed said in an emailed statement. “The systems shaping our lives must be powered by people, open by design, and fueled by imagination.”\nArtificial intelligence has been embraced as a productivity booster in fields such as software engineering or medicine. It could help students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Humanitarian groups are testing its ability to translate important documents for refugees. And some farmers find it useful for detecting pests in their hard-to-survey fields.\nBut others question whether its deployment is actually improving their quality of life. Some point out that real harms exist for children turning to AI chatbots for companionship. AI-generated deepfake videos contribute to the online spread of misinformation and disinformation. The electricity-hungry systems’ reliance on energy generated by fossil fuels contributes to climate change. And economists fear AI is taking jobs from young or entry-level workers.\nThe problem, according to Omidyar Network President Michele L. Jawando, is that tech giants aren’t investing en masse in the first set of use cases. They’re focused on products that may or may not help humans thrive.\nJawando pointed to OpenAI ‘s recent entrance into the online marketplace as an example. At its DevDay last week, the company touted ChatGPT’s new capabilities as a virtual merchant that can sell goods directly for Etsy sellers or deliver food from Uber Eats.\nThe coalition recognizes the private sector’s desire to maximize profits and governments’ interest in spurring innovation, according to Jawando. But between tech companies’ great influence and the Trump administration’s regulatory rollbacks to speed up AI technology construction, she said philanthropic leaders recognized the need for more capital and more collaboration to amplify the voice of civil society.\nJawando said Humanity AI’s role is identifying what “flourishing” looks like in a world with artificial intelligence.\n“Most of what we’re offered right now is efficiency. But that’s not flourishing,” she said. “I don’t want my life to be efficient. I want my life to flourish. I want it to feel rich and robust and healthy and safe.”\nLed by the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network, Humanity AI seeks to take back agency by supporting technology and advocates centering people and the planet. Members must make grants in at least one of five priority areas identified by the coalition: advancing democracy, strengthening education, protecting artists, enhancing work or defending personal security.\nMacArthur Foundation President John Palfrey said he is particularly focused on creating opportunity for early career professionals, regardless of their education levels.\nHe acknowledged that some young job seekers are questioning the ideal of the “American Dream,” that one can make a better life for themselves than the previous generation. But that wouldn’t be the case, he suggested, if decisions about artificial intelligence began with the question: how do we ensure a brighter future for individuals and their families?\n“That’s a very different orientation than ‘How do we invest to make the LLMs be the biggest and fastest,’ right?” Palfrey told The Associated Press, referring to a form of AI known as a large language model that trains on massive bodies of text. “It’s an orientation that centers opportunity and young people.”\nThe alliance of a broad range of philanthropies underscores the widespread concern. Its ranks represent humanities funders such as the Mellon Foundation, tacklers of inequality in the Ford Foundation, an open internet grantmaker in the Mozilla Foundation, education funders such as Lumina Foundation, charitable behemoths such as the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, racial equity supporters such as the Kapor Foundation and groups like the Siegel Family Endowment that have long explored technology’s societal impacts.\nThey’re not the first philanthropic coalition to emerge this year with the goal of ensuring everyday people don’t get left behind. The Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group were among the funders who announced in July that they’d spend $1 billion over 15 years to help create AI tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations. Other efforts seek to improve AI literacy and expand access for entrepreneurs in low-income countries.\nHumanity AI hopes to expand its coalition. Partners began coordinating grants this fall and will pool new money next year in a collaborative fund managed by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors.\nGrantees include the National Black Tech Ecosystem Association, which builds diverse leadership pipelines in STEM; AI Now, a research institute at New York University studying AI’s social implications; and a Howard Law School initiative dedicated to developing AI solutions that advance civil rights. Palfrey said the MacArthur Foundation is increasing its grant to the Pulitzer Center as part of the effort.\n___\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "body": "It’s called automated officiating. The NBA is utilizing it to get even more calls right\nIt’s called automated officiating. The NBA is utilizing it to get even more calls right\nThe play, in real time to the naked eye, might have looked very close to a violation. LeBron James leaped, got his right hand on the ball with a few tenths of the game’s final second remaining and tapped it through the basket to give the Los Angeles Lakers a buzzer-beating win last season.\nReferees on the floor called it correctly. Video replay backed up their call, and the Lakers got a victory over the Indiana Pacers.\nTurns out, it wasn’t close at all.\nThe NBA has a relatively new tool called “automated officiating,” and the robotic eyes that are now tracking just about everything on basketball courts showed that James was nowhere near committing offensive basket interference on that play. It wasn’t needed to decide matters in that case — again, the humans got it right — but the NBA is tapping into technology more and more to ensure that plays like those get adjudicated correctly.\n“Turns out, computers are really good at this,” said Evan Wasch, an NBA executive vice president overseeing basketball strategy and analytics. “So, if we can invest in this technology to get more calls right on the objective ones, we do two things.\n“One, the accuracy on those calls, by definition, goes up. But we also free up the human referees to not have to focus on those calls and in turn allow them to focus more closely on the really difficult judgment plays that they’re so adept at and actually increase accuracy there, too. We think there’s what we call double bottom-line benefit to doing this from an accuracy perspective.”\nBasketball, of course, is not alone in veering toward higher-tech officiating.\nRobot umpires are getting called up to Major League Baseball next season; humans will still make the calls, but teams can challenge ball or strike calls and an automated system will determine if those challenges were successful. Many major tennis tournaments, even Wimbledon, have replaced line judges with electronic line-calling. Soccer has technology to tell referees if a ball fully crossed a goal line or if someone was offsides, calls that in real time might just be guesswork.\nIt’s important to note that NBA referees are not being replaced. Technology is just helping; instead of six human eyes on a court, it’s now six human eyes and a whole lot of camera lenses that are there to collect as much data as the league can think of.\n“Let’s get it right,” Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers said. “And let’s get right quicker.”\nThose are the goals, the NBA insists. Using technology helps with game flow thanks to shorter review times, helps with the accuracy and also provides transparency in the ability to show fans and players computer-generated images to explain how calls were made.\nCameras in arenas are helping to precisely make calls such as the ones along sidelines and baselines — who was a ball off, was it out of bounds, that sort of thing — as well as determining if blocked shots were good or was goaltending committed on those plays.\n“What we’re doing is tracking a bunch of objects in space with incredible precision,” Wasch said. “We are tracking a basketball, fingers, feet, heads, hands, all the parts of the body. We’re tracking them in space with cameras and sensors. And there’s an element of machine learning and artificial intelligence to build those algorithms on top of that to then know what in fact happened from a basketball perspective based on the movement of all those things.”\nThe technology isn’t limited to calls or non-calls.\nSome referees have been wearing earpieces during this preseason as the league tinkers with ways for better communication methods. There’s been talk at the league of sending alerts to smartwatches about decisions on calls. And at summer league this year, there was even a sensor placed inside the ball to help collect data. The sensor weighs about the same as a raisin does. Hundreds of players used the ball, which typically weighs somewhere around 600 grams; nobody noticed that it was about a gram heavier than usual.\nIn the end, it’s all about making the product better.\n“There’s actually been a ton of openness from the referees and the referee union on implementing this technology,” Wasch said. “It lets them focus on the things that they train for this job to do.”\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "body": "Oracle and AMD expand a partnership with deals in the artificial intelligence sector booming\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Oracle and Advanced Micro Devices said Tuesday that they are expanding their partnership with the deployment of 50,000 AMD graphic processing units beginning in the third quarter of 2026 with further expansion to follow.\nThe so-called AI “supercluster” is an enormous, interconnected group of high-performance computers designed to work together as a single system.\nAMD shares rose 1.4% in early trading Tuesday, while Oracle slipped 2.9%.\nThe companies said that next-generation AI models are poised to outgrow the limits of current AI infrastructure.\nThe expanding AMD-Oracle partnership is the latest in a flurry of intertwined deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money.\nOn Monday, ChatGPT maker OpenAI announced that it is working with chipmaker Broadcom to design its own artificial intelligence computer chips.\nLast week, AMD said it will supply its chips to OpenAI in a joint effort to build up AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD.\nChipmaker Nvidia said in September that it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a partnership to add at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI data centers to boost OpenAI’s computing power.\nOpenAI doesn’t turn a profit, but the privately held San Francisco company is now the world’s most valuable startup, with a market valuation of $500 billion, raising concerns that an AI bubble is looming.\nSome industry analysts and financial institutions fear that the rapid growth in tech stock prices have stretched companies’ market valuations beyond their actual worth, comparable to the peak of the 2000 dotcom bubble, which eventually deflated and led to a recession.\nLast week, the Bank of England flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst.\nShares of AMD and Oracle, have soared about 80% this year.\nNeither company gave a dollar figure for their expanded partnership.",

    "body": "Instagram says it’s safeguarding teens by limiting them to PG-13 content\nInstagram says it’s safeguarding teens by limiting them to PG-13 content\nTeenagers on Instagram will be restricted to seeing PG-13 content by default and won’t be able to change their settings without a parent’s permission, Meta announced on Tuesday.\nThis means kids using teen-specific accounts will see photos and videos on Instagram that are similar to what they would see in a PG-13 movie — no sex, drugs or dangerous stunts, among others.\n“This includes hiding or not recommending posts with strong language, certain risky stunts, and additional content that could encourage potentially harmful behaviors, such as posts showing marijuana paraphernalia,” Meta said in a blog post Tuesday, calling the update the most significant since it introduced teen accounts last year.\nAnyone under 18 who signs up for Instagram is automatically placed into restrictive teen accounts unless a parent or guardian gives them permission to opt out. The teen accounts are private by default, have usage restrictions on them and already filter out more “sensitive” content — such as those promoting cosmetic procedures. But kids often lie about their ages when they sign up for social media, and while Meta has began using artificial intelligence to find such accounts, the company declined to say how many adult accounts it has determined to be minors since rolling out the feature earlier this year.\nThe company is also adding an even stricter setting that parents can set up for their children.\nThe changes come as the social media giant faces relentless criticism over harms to children. As it seeks to add safeguards for younger users, Meta has already promised it wouldn’t show inappropriate content to teens, such as posts about self-harm, eating disorders or suicide.\nBut this does not always work. A recent report, for instance, found that teen accounts researchers created were recommended age-inappropriate sexual content, including “graphic sexual descriptions, the use of cartoons to describe demeaning sexual acts, and brief displays of nudity.”\nIn addition, Instagram also recommended a “range of self-harm, self-injury, and body image content” on teen accounts that the report says “would be reasonably likely to result in adverse impacts for young people, including teenagers experiencing poor mental health, or self-harm and suicidal ideation and behaviors.”\nMeta called the report “misleading, dangerously speculative” and that it misrepresents its efforts on teen safety.\nJosh Golin, the executive director of the nonprofit Fairplay, said he’s “very skeptical about how this will be implemented.”\n“From my perspective, these announcements are about two things. They’re about forestalling legislation that Meta doesn’t want to see, and they’re about reassuring parents who are understandably concerned about what’s happening on Instagram,” he said.\n“Splashy press releases won’t keep kids safe, but real accountability and transparency will,” Golin said, adding that passing the federal Kids Online Safety Act would push for this accountability.\nAilen Arreaza, executive director of ParentsTogether, was also skeptical.\n“We’ve heard promises from Meta before, and each time we’ve watched millions be poured into PR campaigns while the actual safety features fall short in testing and implementation. Our children have paid the price for that gap between promise and protection,” Arreaza said. “While any acknowledgment of the need for age-appropriate content filtering is a step in the right direction, we need to see more than announcements — we need transparent, independent testing and real accountability.”\nMeta says the new restrictions go further than its previous safeguards. Teens will no longer be able to follow accounts that regularly share “age-inappropriate content” or if their name or bio contains something that isn’t appropriate for teens, such as a link to an OnlyFans account. If teens already follow these accounts, they’ll no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them messages, or see their comments under anyone’s posts, the company said. The accounts also won’t be able to follow teens, send them private messages or comment on their posts.\nMeta said it already blocks certain search terms related to sensitive topics such as suicide and eating disorders, but the latest update will expand this to a broader range of terms, such as “alcohol” or “gore” — even if they are misspelled.\nThe PG-13 update will also apply artificial intelligence chats and experiences targeted to teens, Meta said, “meaning AIs should not give age-inappropriate responses that would feel out of place in a PG-13 movie.”\nThe Motion Picture Association, which runs the film rating system that was established nearly 60 years ago, said it was not contacted by Meta prior to its announcement.\n“We welcome efforts to protect kids from content that may not be appropriate for them, but assertions that Instagram’s new tool will be ‘guided by PG-13 movie ratings’ or have any connection to the film industry’s rating system are inaccurate,” said Charles Rivkin, the chairman and CEO of the association, in a statement.\nFor parents who want an even stricter setting for their kids, Meta is also launching a “limited content” restriction that will block more content and remove teens’ ability to see, leave, or receive comments under posts.\nTo Maurine Molak, the cofounder of Parents for Safe Online Spaces, or ParentsSOS, whose son died by suicide in 2016 after being bullied online, Meta’s announcement amounts to what she called a “PR stunt.”\n“Any time it seems like we’re getting close to federal legislation...that would actually hold them really accountable and create transparency and independent audits and require parental safety tools that work, it seems like they’re always releasing some new safeguard,” Molak said. “I think it’s for Congress to see...'hey, we’ve got parents, we got you covered, we’re going to take care of you, we don’t need legislation’ and it’s the same thing over and over again.”\nWhile some advocates worry that the announcement may give parents a false sense of security about the safety of their kids on Instagram, Desmond Upton Patton, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies social media, AI, empathy and race, said it gives a “timely opening for parents and caregivers to talk directly with teens about their digital lives, how they use these tools, and how to shape safer habits that enable positive use cases.”\n“I am especially glad to see changes around AI chatbots that make clear they are not human, they do not love you back, and should be engaged with that understanding,” he said. “It is a meaningful step toward a more joyful social media experience for teens.”",

    "body": "GM to take a $1.6 billion hit as tax incentives for EVs are slashed and emission rules ease\nGeneral Motors will record a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed.\nShares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday.\nThe EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.\nMeanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.\nGeneral Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There’s also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.\nGM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.\nThe company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn’t impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.\nEVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.\nIn 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.\nA year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that.\nYet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China’s BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.\nBYD’s sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world’s other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.",

    "body": "NFL uses AI to predict injuries, aiming to keep players healthier\nNFL uses AI to predict injuries, aiming to keep players healthier\nInjuries are an inevitable part of the NFL with all the high-speed collisions, crushing hits and high exertion necessary on every play.\nSuccess each season often comes down to which teams can be the healthiest at the end and a string of injuries has already hampered preseason contenders like Baltimore, San Francisco and Cincinnati.\nWith teams investing hundreds of millions of dollars every season into their rosters, keeping those players available to play is crucial and any small edge has the potential to lead to better results on the field. To help achieve that, the NFL has turned to technology in recent years, partnering with Amazon Web Services on an injury prediction tool that uses data and artificial intelligence to help teams manage the health of their players.\n“Fans want their favorite players on the field. The team owners certainly want those players on the field. The athletes themselves want to be on the field,” said Julie Souza, the global head of sports at AWS. “Anything we can do to improve that and keep players healthy, that’s sort of a noble endeavor.”\nA ‘one-stop shop’ for injury data\nThe Digital Athlete tool takes video and data from players on all 32 teams from training, practice and games, giving every team information on how hard its players have worked, whether they are at risk for more injuries, as well as helping them track leaguewide trends and benchmarks.\nThis is the third season all teams have had access to the Digital Athlete portal and medical staff say it has been extremely beneficial, calling it a “one-stop shop” for information that previously was never available at one source.\n“Basically, it’s giving you more information to ask yourself better questions to then make better interventions to make your process more efficient,” said Tyler Williams, the vice president of health and performance for the Minnesota Vikings. “At the end of the day, if you sum sports science into one sentence: How can we measure and assess to make ourselves more effective and efficient.”\nDigital Athlete uses sensors in the shoulder pads, cameras and optical tracking to gather information from practice and games for every player on all 32 teams, similar to what NextGen stats does to determine who’s the fastest ball carrier or how much separation a receiver generates on his pass routes.\nBut the amount of data is far different.\nWhile NetGen Stats generates about 500 million data points in an entire season, Digital Athlete does that on a weekly basis, meaning the only way to parse through all that to glean anything meaningful is through the use of machine learning and AI technology.\n“The sheer volume of data means somebody can’t be sitting there with a clipboard or Excel figuring that out,” Souza said. “This is absolutely a job for high-performance computers, machine learning, artificial intelligence, all of those things.”\nOne of the strengths of Digital Athlete is its ability to aggregate the data from all 32 teams and more than 1,500 players to give training staffs and coaches better insights into which players might be more susceptible to getting hurt at a given time and what steps have helped reduce the impact of injuries.\nHow Digital Athlete is used\nTeams have used it to help determine practice schedules for training camp, how hard they work the players in a given week of a season and what players or position groups have been pushed so hard that dialing back their work might prevent nagging soft-tissue injuries.\n“You want to find a sweet spot that’s not overworked or underprepared for football,” Williams said. “The more football you play, the better at football you are, but the more fatigued you are. It’s this seesaw balance of tactical and performance. How do we put the players out there to be the best versions of themselves, in the safest manner to have the longevity in the game?”\nWilliams said much of the data reinforces his prior beliefs but there are times it helps him catch something he might have missed. Having empirical evidence also can help him persuade a player who might need a day off or a coach that he has to lighten the load at practice or sometimes can push his team harder.\nThe model can tell the training staff how much a player has worked by tracking decelerations, accelerations, total workload on field, change of direction.\nWhile the NFL said overall injuries have been reduced since the introduction of Digital Athlete, Williams said there are many factors involved and he can’t be sure there’s a direct causation.\n“Everybody is always going to want the smoking gun that if we do A and pair it with B, we will get C,” Williams said. “It doesn’t ever work like that. Everyone wants to talk about well, this team’s really good at preventing injuries. Nobody’s preventing injuries. It’s what type of recipe can you put together that mitigates the risk the best. With the more we measure, the more risk we’ll be able to mitigate.”\nHow it impacted rule changes\nThe NFL has also used the data gathered from these systems to model the impact of rule changes like the new kickoff that was put in place last season or the crackdown on hip-drop tackles. Digital Athlete was able to simulate 10,000 seasons to help model how the new kickoff rule would impact injuries.\nIt also has helped inform the league on things like which helmets are best at protecting players from concussions. NFL executive Dawn Aponte said the data helped the league make changes to the helmets for quarterbacks by putting more padding in the back of the helmet.\n“Last year we saw the lowest number of concussions in the NFL since we started tracking them,” Aponte said. “That really is something that we attribute to the fact of being able to look at all of this data and come up with better equipment, better-performing helmets, ways in which we make the helmets and manufacture them based on the types of hits and impacts these players are having.”\nAponte said the initial reaction from some old-timers was to wonder if this was “junk science.” But now she sees much more acceptance from everyone involved, from coaches to medical staff to players.\n“I think this has now been presented as an additive tool,” she said. “It doesn’t take away from decisions of coaches that are going to do what they feel is best for that specific athlete, or the team at large. But when you’re actually able to point them to certain things and say, hey, this is what we’re seeing. This is causing X times more likely for this player to sustain an injury. When they start losing players, particularly in training camp, they pay more attention.”\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

U.S. presidents typically do not weigh in on the candidates in other countries’ democratic elections.\nReferring to an opponent who was “extremely far-left” and encompassed a “philosophy that got Argentina into this problem in the first place,” Trump warned that the United States wouldn’t “waste our time” with largesse toward Buenos Aires if Milei does not prevail. In addition to the midterms that will be a referendum on his policies, Milei himself is up for reelection in 2027.\n“We’re not going to let somebody get into office and squander the taxpayer money from this country. I’m not gonna let it happen,” Trump said from the Cabinet Room as he prepared to eat lunch with Milei. “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.”\nEven so, Trump insisted that the $20 billion assistance to Argentina, which administration officials strenuously deny is a bailout, was about helping “our neighbors” rather than any ties to the upcoming midterms.\n“It’s just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” the U.S. president said. “Argentina is one of the most beautiful countries that I’ve ever seen, and we want to see it succeed. It’s very simple.”\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that the administration believed Milei’s coalition in the upcoming midterms would “do quite well and continue his reform agenda.”\nAs he opened his lunch with Milei, Trump noted that the Argentine president, who is an economist by trade, is “MAGA all the way.” That traditionally refers to his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” but this time, it also meant “Make Argentina Great Again.”\nTrump’s meeting with Milei was already making waves back in Argentina, with Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, leader of the left-leaning Peronist opposition and a two-term former president, writing on social media: “Trump to Milei: ´Our agreements are subject to whoever wins election´. Argentines ... you know what to do!”\nThe former president is serving a six-year sentence under house arrest since June for corruption, but she remains the most influential leader of Peronism, an ideologically flexible, labor rights-focused populist movement, which emerged in the 1940s and dominated politics for decades.\nAhead of his White House meeting and during it Milei lavished praise on Trump, deploying a tactic that has helped transform Milei’s cash-strapped country into one of the Trump administration’s closest allies.\nMilei, speaking in Spanish, said he is “very honored, especially in this moment when we are giving thanks for Trump’s great leadership.”\n“We can follow a peaceful route and make Argentina a strong example for freedom and prosperity,” Milei said.\nThat bromance has already paid off for Argentina — most recently, to the tune of a $20 billion bailout.\nIn a crisis, turning to Trump\nThe Trump administration made a highly unusual decision to intervene in Argentina’s currency market after Milei’s party suffered a landslide loss in a local election last month.\nAlong with setbacks in the opposition-dominated Congress, the party’s crushing defeat created a crisis of confidence as voters in Buenos Aires Province registered their frustration with rising unemployment, contracting economic activity and brewing corruption scandals.\nAlarmed that this could herald the end of popular support for Milei’s free-market program, investors dumped Argentine bonds and sold off the peso.\nArgentina’s Treasury began hemorrhaging precious dollar reserves at a feverish pace, trying shore up the currency and keep its exchange rate within the trading band set as part of the country’s recent $20 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund.\nBut as the peso continued to slide, Milei grew desperate.\nHe met with Trump on Sept. 23 while in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. A flurry of back-slapping, hand-shaking and mutual flattery between the two quickly gave way to Bessent publicly promising Argentina a lifeline of $20 billion.\nMarkets cheered, and investors breathed a sigh of relief.\nTiming is everything\nIn the days that followed, Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo spent hours in meetings in Washington trying to seal the deal.\nReassurance came last Thursday, when Bessent announced that the U.S. would allow Argentina to exchange up to $20 billion worth of pesos for an equal sum in dollars. Saying that the success of Milei’s program was “of systemic importance,” Bessent added that the U.S. Treasury directly purchased an unspecified amount of pesos.\nFor the Trump administration, the timing was awkward as it struggles to manage the optics of bailing out a nine-time serial defaulter in the middle of a U.S. government shutdown that has led to mass layoffs. Democratic lawmakers and other critics have slammed it as an example of Trump rewarding loyalists at the expense of American taxpayers.\nLater Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — who was singled out during the White House meeting by both Bessent and Trump — tried to advance a bill that would block the $20 billion in U.S. assistance, but the gambit failed in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nSaying Trump was only aiding Argentina to help Milei, Warren said, “That’s Argentina first, not America first.”\nBut for Argentina, the U.S. help came in the nick of time.\nAware of how a weak currency could threaten his flagship achievement of taming inflation and hurt his popularity, Milei hopes to stave off what many economists see as an inescapable currency devaluation until after the Oct. 26 midterm elections. A devaluation of the peso would likely fuel a resurgence in inflation.\nTalks also touch on artificial intelligence\nAnother topic that had been on the agenda was the Stargate project, which would expand a network of massive artificial intelligence centers to Latin America, according to a person with knowledge of the plans who was granted anonymity to speak about private discussions.\nArgentina could be home to Latin America’s first Stargate, which is a joint initiative from OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank that will build a network of big data centers that would power OpenAI’s artificial intelligence technology. It’s an initiative that’s been championed by Trump himself.\nMilei also joined a ceremony at the White House honoring Charlie Kirk, the prominent right-wing political activist who was fatally shot last month. Milei often crossed paths with Kirk on the speaking circuit of the ascendant global right.\nThere has been no word on how Argentina, the IMF’s largest debtor, will end up paying the U.S. back for this $20 billion, which comes on top of IMF’s own loan for the same amount in April. And that one came on top of an earlier IMF loan for $40 billion.\nDespite all the help, Milei’s government already missed the IMF’s early targets for rebuilding currency reserves.\n“The U.S. should be concerned that Argentina has had to return for $20 billion so quickly after getting $14 billion upfront from the IMF,” said Brad Setser, a former Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n—\nDebre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "body": "China and the US have long collaborated in ‘open research.’ Some in Congress say that must change\nChina and the US have long collaborated in ‘open research.’ Some in Congress say that must change\nWASHINGTON (AP) — For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.\nThey are worried that China — now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance — is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.\n“For far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.\nThe House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a “pipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.”\nThe rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world’s two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.\n“Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,” said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.\nThe House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China’s military powers.\nDeep ties between Chinese and US research\nMore than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.\nDespite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China’s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nThe report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.\nThis collaboration not only facilitates “potential illicit knowledge transfer,” but supports China’s “state-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,” the report said.\nForeign countries can exploit American research by stealing secrets for use in military and commercial settings, by poaching talented researchers for foreign companies and universities and by recruiting students and researchers as potential spies, authorities say.\nFostering a climate of robust academic research takes funding and long-term support. Stealing the fruits of that labor, however, can be as easy as hacking into a university network, hiring away researchers or coopting the research itself. That’s why, authorities say, it’s so tempting for American adversaries looking to take advantage of U.S. institutions and research.\nThe most recent threat assessment report from the Department of Homeland Security highlights concerns that American adversaries — and China specifically — seek to illicitly acquire U.S. technology. Authorities say China aims to steal military and computing technology that might give the U.S. an advantage, as well as the latest commercial innovations.\nIndustry seeks a balance\nAbigail Coplin, assistant professor of sociology and science, technology and society at Vassar College, said there are already guardrails for federally funded research to protect classified information and anything deemed sensitive.\nShe also said open research goes both ways, benefiting the U.S. as well, and restrictions could be counterproductive by driving away talents.\n“American national security interests and economic competitiveness would be better served by continuing — if not increasing — research funding than they are by implementing costly research restrictions,” Coplin said.\nArnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.\nBellini said it’s imperative to encourage research and development without giving secrets away to America’s enemies. “In the U.S., it is a reality now that our digital borders are under siege — and businesses of every size are right to be concerned,” Bellini said.\nAccording to Department of Justice figures, about 80% of all economic espionage cases prosecuted in the U.S. involve alleged acts that would benefit China.\nSome members of Congress have pushed to reinstate a Department of Justice program created during the first Trump administration that sought to investigate Chinese intellectual espionage. The so-called “ ChinaInitiative ” ended in 2022 after critics said it failed to address the problem even as it perpetrated racist stereotypes about Asian American academics.",

    "body": "In some Connecticut towns, clouds form over new solar developments\nThe first time Chris Dahl heard rumblings of a plan to build a large solar array among the corn fields and tobacco sheds of East Windsor, she said the project sounded like a good enough idea.\nA portion of the land slated for development included a sand and gravel quarry that had become an attractive hangout for underage drinkers and ATV riders, much to the displeasure of local residents and town officials.\nPlus, Dahl said, the project promised to produce gobs of clean, carbon-free electricity — the kind of mission that she and her wife, Robin Chesky, had supported by installing solar panels on the roof of their own home in town.\nDahl wasn’t alone in her initial feelings about the project, which even adopted a name highlighting its adaptive reuse of the old quarry: Gravel Pit Solar.\nLocal officials also threw their support behind it, citing the project’s benefits to the town as well as Connecticut’s broader effort to shift away from its reliance on older fuel-burning power plants. While testifying in favor of Gravel Pit Solar’s application before state regulators in 2020, East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said the community was “very supportive of renewable energy projects, especially when the projects make sense for us.”\n“This is not going to be something that becomes an eyesore,” he added.\nBut by the time Gravel Pit Solar began to take shape in late 2021, Dahl and others were having second thoughts.\nThey grew alarmed as they watched construction spread beyond the gravel pit area onto hundreds of acres of surrounding farmland. Trees and shrubs were cleared to make way for solar panels, and workers erected a wire fence around the site, which Dahl said she feared would block the movement of local wildlife.\nThe first time she drove over a hill and witnessed the extent of the project, Dahl said she began to cry.\n“It just overwhelmed me,” she said. “Gone was the farmland. Gone was the open space, now it was filled with panels … It was really unexpected for me, and I think other people have had similar experiences.”\nWith an output of up to 120 megawatts, Gravel Pit Solar is by far the largest solar array in Connecticut and one of the largest in New England. Its thousands of panels are enough to cover more than 350 football fields and are capable of producing roughly one-quarter of all the existing utility-scale solar power in the state. The site runs from Apothecaries Hall and Windsorville roads on the north side to Plantation Road on the south, according to the site plans.\nIts construction has made East Windsor the forerunner in the state’s charge toward solar energy development. Surrounding towns, too, have joined in the bonanza with other large arrays sprouting up on former farm fields throughout the region.\nAfter initially welcoming the Gravel Pit project, however, many residents and local officials now say they’ve soured on the town’s status as a hotbed for the solar industry. Critics have accused developers of snatching up farmland, altering the rural character of the town and ignoring local concerns about noise and safety.\nAnd East Windsor isn’t the only Connecticut community where solar opposition is on the rise. Experts warn the growing pushback could threaten the state’s ability to meet its long-term commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by deploying new, cleaner forms of electricity generation.\nStill, solar developers haven’t slowed down.\nRoughly a month after commencing full operations in April, Gravel Pit’s developers, DESRI Holdings, filed a request with the Connecticut Siting Council to expand the existing facility by another 30 megawatts onto adjacent properties. The company has also revealed its plans to build a second 100-megawatt facility, Saltbox Solar, on farmland in the towns of East Windsor and Ellington.\n“Connecticut needs additional power to meet future demand, and state law requires all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2040,” the company said in a statement.\n“Regulators determine how to balance those needs with local concerns,” the statement continued. “DESRI is proud to help provide affordable, clean power to the state by developing projects that are consistent with state policy and is committed to engaging local communities throughout the process.”\nIn an effort to marshal the local opposition to solar expansion, Dahl and Chesky formed East Windsor Residents for Responsible Solar Development and have been collecting hundreds of signatures from people urging the Siting Council to reject the latest proposal.\nTheir efforts have attracted the support of state lawmakers— even some who strongly support the state’s clean-energy efforts —who are now pressing for systemic changes to the process of approving larger solar arrays and other renewable energy projects that would give cities and towns more of a say in determining whether those facilities get built.\n“We don’t want any more of these,” East Windsor First Selectman Jason Bowsza said recently. “I want to be very clear — we don’t want any more of these.”\nWho gives the go-ahead\nThat systemic change lawmakers are considering could begin with the Connecticut Siting Council. Established in 1971, the council regulates the placement of power plants and electric transmission lines, a process that was previously controlled largely by the use of eminent domain by utility companies.\nThe council’s jurisdiction has since grown to include cellphone towers, hazardous waste facilities and other types of vital infrastructure projects that often meet with heavy pushback from neighbors. For that reason, the council has the final say over siting such facilities, preempting local control.\n“It was basically to end town-by-town regulation of these larger projects that impact interstate commerce,” said Melanie Bachman, who has served as the executive director of the Siting Council since 2013.\nIf each town had the authority to veto projects within its borders, she added, “the lights would go off and telecommunications would go out.”\nCritics, however, say the Siting Council has gone too far in weighing the interests of developers over local opposition. They point to the fact that the council has, in recent years, approved more than 80% of its applications to build large solar arrays. (By statute, the council has jurisdiction over siting any electric-generating facility over 1 megawatt, though developers of smaller projects can waive their exclusion to avoid leaving the decision up to municipal officials.)\n“We look at the state and say, ‘You need to do a better job, because these are being built in residential zones, and the impact on the community and the residents that have purchased property next to them is huge,’” Dahl said.\nThat sentiment has grown particularly powerful within a handful of towns along the eastern side of the Connecticut River, just south of the Massachusetts border. The area — also known as the “Tobacco Valley” — has become an attractive destination for solar developers due to an abundance of relatively cheap farmland and easy access to existing transmission lines.\nAside from Gravel Pit Solar, a few smaller facilities are either operating or under construction in East Windsor’s southeast corner, an area of town known as Windsorville. Nearly a dozen other arrays, ranging in size from a few acres to larger than Vatican City, have been built or are under construction in nearby towns such as Enfield, Ellington and Somers.\nBy contrast, the Siting Council has approved just a single solar project in all of Fairfield County: a 2-megawatt facility in Bridgeport.\nMike Trahan, the executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Energy Storage Association, said solar development is concentrated in places where substations connecting to the regional electric grid have the capacity to handle the power produced by larger arrays. In more densely populated parts of the state like Fairfield County, Trahan said, higher land values and a backlog of available interconnections serve as an impediment to solar development.\n“The bottom line is these projects, all of them, have to interconnect with the existing infrastructure, and that’s where developers go,” Trahan said. “There’s just no way around it.”\nWhile Bachman declined to comment specifically on the Gravel Pit project or its proposed expansion, she defended the council’s overall track record by noting that developers often go through years of careful planning and consultations with utilities and other state agencies, such as the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, before even submitting their applications to the Siting Council.\nThat process ends up weeding out many projects that could raise flags, she said.\nBachman said council members are limited to considering a specific set of criteria when reviewing a project application. That criteria requires the Siting Council to determine whether there is a public need for the proposed facility and whether its impact — either alone or cumulatively with other existing facilities in the area — would pose significant harm to the environment, wildlife, public health or scenic and recreational areas.\nMore local concerns, such as the impact on property values or municipal tax rolls, are not part of the council’s evaluation criteria, she said. “Anything related to an environmental effect, we can look at cumulatively,” Bachman said.\nBut Bowsza, the first selectman in East Windsor, accused the council of ignoring its own criteria to look at the cumulative impact of existing facilities, given the number of projects that have already been sited in his town.\n“If I show you an aerial map of my town, or if I show you the chart that demonstrates the aggregate renewable energy in the state and how much East Windsor produces, how — with a straight face — has that not had a cumulative impact on the community?” Bowsza said. “It’s not fathomable that they’re considering that.”\nTrahan, of the solar trade association, said he can understand some of the frustrations raised by people living next to large arrays, but he said developers have also worked with neighbors to minimize those concerns — by planting shrubs or other vegetation around a project, or locating them in areas where they’re less likely to draw attention, such as on top of old landfills.\nHe also defended the Siting Council’s scrutiny over solar projects. Often, he said, the council has required developers to undertake costly revisions to their plans that address concerns raised by neighbors or environmental advocates.\n“The Siting Council is being asked to make decisions that make everybody happy, and that’s just not possible,” Trahan said.\nWhere there’s smoke\nOn a windy afternoon in March, Dana Van Steenburgh was in his front yard in East Windsor, fixing the mailbox with his son and a neighbor, when a loud noise startled the group.\nThe source of the noise, Van Steenburgh said, was an exploding transformer along power lines rising up from the nearly 30-acre solar array across the street. The perimeter of the array is surrounded by fencing, dry grass and a line of ornamental shrubs installed by the facility’s owners.\n“I heard this loud explosion,” he said. “I saw the brightest green light you’ve ever seen, and then a spark fell to the ground and those (shrubs) went up like a Q-tip soaked in alcohol.”\nVan Steenburgh said he called 911 and watched as the fire spread to within 100 feet of a nearby tobacco shed before firefighters arrived and doused the flames, narrowly averting an even bigger calamity.\nThe March fire was the latest in what neighbors say is a series of issues with the array and its developers, dating back to when the facility began construction in 2021. Located on Middle Road, roughly two miles from the much larger Gravel Pit Solar, the array was developed by West Hartford’s Verogy, which later sold the facility to a subsidiary of Florida-based NextEra Energy.\nAmong the most persistent complaints has to do with a high-pitched buzz, or “ringing” noise that neighbors say is produced by the facility’s power inverters during bright, sunny days. They say the noise can be heard throughout the tract of homes directly across the street from the array, which is otherwise located in a largely agricultural area, dotted with corn and tobacco fields.\n“You’re trying to enjoy the outdoors, in the fresh air, and then you’re hearing ringing noise in your ears,” said Rich Levesque, one of the local residents who has raised complaints. “It’s just annoying, you know? It’s just not right.”\nIn response, attorneys for the project’s developers have submitted evidence to the Siting Council showing that the noise emitted by the facility is below the 55 decibel limit, or about the volume of a kitchen refrigerator.\nNextEra has also attempted to mitigate the problem by installing a plywood fence and, later, a full sound barrier around the solar array.\n“While our project was already in compliance with applicable noise requirements, we voluntarily installed a sound barrier, as a good neighbor, to further reduce noise levels from the inverters at the site,” NextEra spokesman Chris Curtland said in a statement. “A subsequent study confirmed that the sound barrier successfully reduced sound from the inverters. We continue to engage with a sound engineer, despite remaining in compliance with the law and observing significant noise improvement at the site.”\nCurtland added that the March fire was caused by equipment owned by the local utility company, Eversource, and that it did not result in damage to the solar array.\nIn a statement, Eversource spokeswoman Tricia Modifica said that the fire was caused by equipment failure during high winds. “We quickly identified the issue and replaced the equipment within 24 hours,” Modifica said. “The incident is currently being reviewed by regulators.”\nBoth Van Steenburgh and Levesque said the fencing has reduced the noise somewhat, but the problem persists. They said NextEra officials stopped responding to their complaints and requests that the company invest in a costlier solution: relocating the inverters farther away from their homes.\nChesky, the co-founder of the East Windsor Residents for Responsible Solar Development, said she believes the issues surrounding the facility on Middle Road are the result of failures in the siting process that could have been avoided. She said the Siting Council could benefit from a more specific set of guidelines for considering solar projects and clearer rules for how close equipment can be to homes and businesses. (In 2024, state lawmakers voted to require that certain solar facilities locate inverters at least 200 feet from the nearest property line.)\n“They need to know more about what is right and what is wrong in these situations, and what is best practices and what is not,” Chesky said. “And I think that the state probably could do a better job giving them the tools that they need to be making educated decisions.”\nDuring a public hearing on Thursday, officials working on the Gravel Pit expansion project acknowledged that a small brush fire broke out at the original facility in September but said it did not damage any equipment.\nJon Gravel, DESRI’s Director of Development, said the fire was the result of a “tractor malfunction” and was safely extinguished by the local fire department.\n‘Plants, not panels’\nMeanwhile, plans to build even more solar panels in the vicinity of Middle Road have irked the small group of neighbors and local farmers, many of whom have placed yellow signs on their lawns urging “plants, not panels.”\nBlueprints for Saltbox Solar, the latest project from DESRI Holdings, show fields of solar panels surrounding three sides of the small subdivision where Van Steenburgh and Levesque live.\n“I don’t have an issue once they fix this,” Levesque said, referring to the noise emitted by the existing facility on Middle Road. “But I would have a real issue if they went and bought up the rest of the land and put solar all around us, because now we’re in a bowl.”\nSeth Bahler, a dairy farmer, rents 310 acres of land slated for development by DESRI’s Saltbox project, where he currently grows corn and soybeans to feed his roughly 3,000 cows. He said developers can afford to lease the same land for three to five times the current rate, pricing farmers out of the market.\n“I don’t blame the landowners either, because they’re getting a better price than what we can offer,” Bahler said. “The challenge is these solar developing companies don’t care about the future, and there’s a limited amount of land that all of us farmers use.”\nOn the website for Saltbox Solar, DESRI states that the noise emitted by its facilities is “minimal” and that it will use “best management practices” to preserve topsoil so that the land can be returned to an agricultural use after the solar panels are eventually decommissioned and removed. In addition, the company says that solar arrays are expected to cover less than 0.03% of farmland nationally by 2030.\nThe project has yet to be submitted to the Siting Council for approval.\nOpposition could slow solar’s faster, cheaper path to clean energy goals\nEven with large projects like Gravel Pit Solar, Connecticut is lagging behind neighboring states when it comes to the deployment of utility-scale solar.\nAccording to a database published by the U.S. Geological Survey, Massachusetts is home to nearly 500 arrays with a combined capacity of 1,344 megawatts. Connecticut, by comparison, has just 69 projects with a capacity of around 294 megawatts. (The data was published in April as Gravel Pit was nearing completion and reflects only a fraction of the project’s full 120 megawatt capacity.) Rhode Island, with its much smaller geographic size and population, has 65 arrays with a capacity of 397 megawatts.\nAll three states have made commitments to slash greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century as part of their efforts to address climate change. But over the next decade, the New England region is expected to see demand for power grow sharply due to the electrification of cars, home heating systems and the development of AI data centers.\nOther sources of power that could be tapped to meet that demand — including nuclear, offshore wind or even new gas-fired power plants — generally face longer construction timelines and added costs when compared to solar, according to Erik Katovich, a professor of energy and resource economics at the University of Connecticut.\n“Thee quickest thing to scale up right now for Connecticut would be the utility-scale solar,” Katovich said. “Relative to other options, it’s pretty quick to build, and it is very cheap.”\nAnd as more communities resist large solar arrays, state lawmakers in Hartford are joining in.\nEarlier this year, a group of lawmakers representing East Windsor proposed legislation that would have allowed town leaders to veto proposed solar arrays within a five mile radius of any existing array with an output of over 100 megawatts — a threshold that would have applied only to Gravel Pit Solar.\n“This isn’t anti-solar, this is about one town being disproportionately impacted,” said state Rep. Jaime Foster, D-Ellington, one of the co-sponsors of the bill, during a press conference earlier this year. “The Siting Council has jokingly called East Windsor the solar capital of the Northeast. We don’t want to be.”\nWhile the legislation failed to gain traction, Foster said she’s hoping to keep attention on the issue by renting a bus and inviting fellow lawmakers and Gov. Ned Lamont on a tour of her district before next year’s General Assembly session, when she plans to file legislation to impose a moratorium on new solar development in the area around East Windsor.\nFoster said the tour will showcase the number of existing arrays in the region while giving officials a chance to meet with neighbors opposed to further development.\nOther ideas put forward by lawmakers this year included granting municipalities and local zoning boards more authority to weigh in on Siting Council decisions, as well as requiring developers of large solar projects to provide upfront bonds to cover the restoration of forests or farmland after the project is decommissioned. The first two bills failed, but Lamont signed the decommissioning legislation into law.\nEven state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, a former co-chair of the Environment Committee and longtime solar advocate, put forward legislation that would have prohibited the clearing of forested land for the purpose of building utility-scale solar. The bill was unsuccessful.\nMushinsky said that while solar developers had offered the state the “sales pitch” of building on top of existing buildings and parking lot canopies, many have instead opted for the more economical path of building on plots of rural undeveloped land.\n“It’s just because it’s cheaper,” Mushinsky said. “That’s the only reason they go there. It’s cheaper to buy a tract of forest and clear-cut it and sell the wood, and then put in a solar farm.”\nTrahan, with the Energy and Storage Association, said such claims are overblown. He said existing solar arrays cover less than one quarter of 1% of the state’s forests and farmland, and he said the Siting Council already considers impacts to farmland and core forests — a designation that refers to large, unbroken tracts of forest — when considering project applications.\n“Developers were recruited here to come to the state of Connecticut to help the state meet its clean energy goals,” Trahan said. “They didn’t just invite themselves here and say, ‘Here we are. Suck it up.’”\nHe also took issue with critics who say Connecticut has too much solar development.\n“I think that concern is misplaced if you look at the facts in terms of how many projects have been developed, compared to how much forest and farmland is out there right now.”\nFoster and her allies had more success with a proposal to apply a tax of $10,000 per megawatt on large solar arrays. The proposal, known as a uniform capacity tax, was included within a much larger energy bill that Lamont signed on July 1.\nThe tax was intended to address disputes between local officials and solar developers over facilities that qualified for various property tax exemptions, along with difficulties assessors face in determining the appropriate value of solar panels and other associated equipment.\nWhile the new tax does not go into effect until next year, Foster said she hopes the deadline will bring developers to the negotiating table to settle for long-term tax stabilization agreements.\n“My hope is that the existence of this (law) helps them negotiate for a better rate in the meantime,” she said. “The previous examples in the town are they’re sued and they lose litigation money, and then they get no taxes, or they settle for something that’s sort of de minimis.”\nIn early 2020, East Windsor officials entered into a tax stabilization agreement with Gravel Pit Solar, making the project the town’s biggest taxpayer. Bowsza said it was that promise of revenue that led to his initial support for the project.\nIt was only after the full scope of the project became apparent, he said, that he began to have regrets. “If we had done a full stabilization agreement later, I don’t know that we would have made a deal.”\nAccording to meeting minutes posted on the town’s website, Gravel Pit’s proposed size was “approximately 75 megawatts” at the time the agreement was signed in May. However, Bowsza acknowledged during that meeting that the developers had the option to increase the size of the project to up to 125 megawatts.\nBy the time Bowsza indicated his approval before the Siting Council that November, the project had reached its final size of 120 megawatts.\n‘A mad dash’\nAs part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, Republicans axed federal tax credits that were put in place under the Biden administration to spur the development of large solar projects.\nIn order to qualify for the remaining credits, projects must begin construction next year or enter service no later than the end of 2027. As a result, developers are rushing to gain approval from state regulators to begin work while their opponents are hoping to delay until the deadline passes.\n“There’s a mad dash going on right now” said Trahan. “It’s all hands on deck, not just on the residential but on the commercial side.”\nA spokesperson for DESRI Holdings, the developer of the Gravel Pit project, declined to comment about whether the impending loss of federal tax credits might affect the company’s plans in and around East Windsor.\nLate last month, the developer requested and received approval from the Siting Council for additional time to respond to hundreds of written questions from local residents in East Windsor. On Friday, the Siting Council moved to extend its deadline for a final decision from November to May 10.\nDESRI Holdings is based in New York City and operates two other solar arrays in Connecticut — Tobacco Valley Solar in Simsbury and Fusion Solar in Sprague.\nKatovich, the UConn economics professor, said that while the loss of federal subsidies may doom projects that are on the margin of profitability, they are unlikely to freeze the industry entirely. That’s because the long-term decline in the price and efficiency of solar panels has made them more competitive against traditional forms of power such as oil and natural gas, he said.\n“Honestly, a big part of the cost is being driven not by the panels themselves but by the permitting, the planning, the installation, the labor and the electricity hook-up to the grid,” Katovich said. “So those have become the really big cost drivers, much more than the actual materials of the solar panels.”\nIn addition, while Katovich said that solar arrays have historically been subject to less local opposition than more visible forms of renewable energy such as wind turbines, they are beginning to face similar headwinds in places like California’s central valley, where developers have been accused of covering up farmland and pricing out farmers who lease the land.\nIn August, the Trump administration announced it would no longer subsidize the installation of solar panels on “productive” farmland through the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America Program.\n“It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage,” Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement accompanying the announcement.\nThe program had previously funded over a dozen solar projects in Connecticut farms, vineyards and stables, according to the USDA.\nFoster, the state lawmaker representing East Windsor, said she was unsure whether the changes in federal policy would come quick enough to affect projects that are already well-along in the planning stages, such as proposed Gravel Pit expansion.\nHowever, Foster said that slowing down a decision from the Siting Council would likely benefit the town and the project’s critics.\n“Delaying has two benefits,” she said. “It has the benefit of them running out the clock on the extensions possible under the Trump administration for tax credits. But the delay is also beneficial, because it’ll guarantee that the (uniform capacity tax) applies.”\n___\nThis story was originally published by CT Mirror and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",

    "body": "California governor vetoes bill to restrict kids’ access to AI chatbots\nCalifornia governor vetoes bill to restrict kids’ access to AI chatbots\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children’s access to AI chatbots.\nThe bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn’t engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.\n“While I strongly support the author’s goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,” Newsom said.\nThe veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.\nNewsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.\nCalifornia is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.\nThe two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.\nThe youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate “humanlike relationship” with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.\nJames Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom’s veto of the bill was “deeply disappointing.”\n“This legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous — and even deadly — AI companion chatbots,” he said.\nBut the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.\nSteyer also said the notification law didn’t go far enough, saying it “provides minimal protections for children and families.”\n“This legislation was heavily watered down after major Big Tech industry pressure,” he said, calling it “basically a Nothing Burger.”\nBut OpenAI praised Newsom’s signing of the law.\n“By setting clear guardrails, California is helping shape a more responsible approach to AI development and deployment across the country,” spokesperson Jamie Radice said.\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta in September told OpenAI he has “serious concerns” with its flagship chatbot, OpenAI, for children and teens. The Federal Trade Commission also launched an inquiry last month into several AI companies about the potential risks for children when they use chatbots as companions.\nResearch by a watchdog group says chatbots have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders. The mother of a teenage boy in Florida who died by suicide after developing what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a chatbot has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Character.AI. And the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine recently sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier this year.\nOpenAI and Meta last month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress.\nMeta said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.\nOpenAI said it is rolling out new controls enabling parents to link their accounts to their teen’s account.\n___\nEDITOR’S NOTE: This story includes discussion of suicide.

OpenAI has also made big deals with Oracle, CoreWeave and other companies developing the data centers where those chips are housed.\nMany of the deals rely on circular financing, in which the companies are both investing in OpenAI and supplying the world’s most valuable startup with technology, fueling concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI doesn’t yet turn a profit but says its products now have more than 800 million weekly users.\n“What’s real about this announcement is OpenAI’s intention of having its own custom chips,” said analyst Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. “The rest is fantastical. OpenAI has made, at this point, approaching $1 trillion of commitments, and it’s a company that only has $15 billion of revenue.”\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the work with Broadcom to develop a custom chip began about 18 months ago. Broadcom also works with other leading AI developers, including tech giants Amazon and Google.\nAltman said on a podcast announcing the deal that the computing power made possible through the Broadcom partnership will amount to 10 gigawatts, which he described as “a gigantic amount of computing infrastructure to serve the needs of the world to use advanced intelligence.”\nBroadcom shares surged more than 9% on Monday.\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said on the same podcast that OpenAI needs more computing capacity as it progresses toward a “better and better frontier model and towards superintelligence.”\n“If you do your own chips, you control your destiny,” he added.",

America needs more speed and investment.”\nThis summer, JPMorgan helped put together a deal under which the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in U.S. rare earth company MP Materials. The bank is also providing financing for MP Materials’ second magnet producing factory in the U.S.\nThe nation’s largest bank plans to finance approximately $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these industries. JPMorgan Chase is looking to increase this amount by up to $500 billion, or a 50% increase, with additional resources and capital.\n“America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said. “It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.”\nJPMorgan says that it serves 34,000 mid-sized companies and more than 90% of the Fortune 500.\nIt plans to hire more bankers, investment professionals and other experts to help address its investment plan. It will also create an external advisory council that includes leaders from the public and private sectors to help guide the long-term strategy.",

KTN News and Citizen TV later said the death toll had increased to four, with scores injured. After security forces fired shots, police used teargas to disperse thousands of mourners, the two broadcasters reported, leaving the stadium deserted.\nEarlier in the day, thousands of mourners briefly stormed Nairobi’s international airport, interrupting a ceremony for the president, William Ruto, and other officials to receive Odinga’s body with military honours. The incident prompted a two-hour suspension of airport operations.\nCrowds also flooded nearby roads and tried to breach parliament, where the government had originally scheduled the public viewing.\nThough mainly known as an opposition figure, Odinga became prime minister in 2008 and also struck a political pact with Ruto last year in a career marked by shifting alliances.\nHe commanded passionate devotion among supporters, especially in his Luo community based in western Kenya, many of whom believe he was denied the presidency by electoral fraud.\nMany of Odinga’s mourners, who were not yet born in 1991 when Kenya became a multi-party democracy, paid tribute to Odinga’s efforts as an activist.\nFelix Ambani Uneck, a university student, said at the stadium: “He fought tirelessly for multi-party democracy, and we are enjoying those freedoms today because of his struggle.”",

    "body": "The niece of Agnes Wanjiru, who was killed in Kenya, said she hopes the former British soldier charged with her aunt’s murder will be extradited while the Labour government is still in power.\nOn her first trip outside Kenya, Esther Njoki travelled to London, where she was invited to parliament to meet the defence secretary, John Healey, whom she urged not to delay the potentially years-long extradition process.\n“We are hoping that before his time ends and they get out of government he will have achieved what he wanted to achieve in Agnes’ case,” she said, “and it will be good for him, and also for [Wanjiru’s] family, and the whole world, because everyone is watching.”\nNjoki, 21, who acts as the spokesperson for Wanjiru’s family, added that she has noticed “a big change” in the approach from the UK since Labour came to power last year, and fears that progress in the case may stall under a different government.\n“Before it was it was very hard for us even to engage,” she said. “We even never got a chance to engage with the UK authorities, but now it is easy even to get to meet with the secretary of state for defence. We appreciate that, we don’t take it for granted.”\nWanjiru, a 21-year-old hairdresser, disappeared after a night out in Nanyuki, Kenya in 2012. Her body was found several weeks later in the grounds of the hotel where she was last seen.\nLast month, a Kenyan court issued a warrant for the arrest of a suspect in the case, named as Robert James Purkiss, a former British soldier, who has been charged by a Kenyan court with a single count of murder.\nIn order for the suspect to face charges in Kenya, an extradition request will first have to be received and authorised by the UK courts.\n“I’m hoping that whatever we discussed, it will be put into consideration, and things will be fast-tracked, because there’s the extradition process that is ahead,” Njoki said.\n“I believe … his hands are tied. He can’t do much because he might prejudice the criminal matter. But again, if there is political will, things might go faster. So we’re just hoping that things will be taken seriously and they’ll keep us updated as the family, and ensure that justice is served.”\nHealey, who had urged the previous government to act in Wanjiru’s case while in opposition, also met the family in Kenya in April, becoming the first UK government minister to do so.\n“We appreciate it, because it’s the second time, he’s a senior official. It’s hard to meet such people, so I appreciate the support that he always gives, and being willing to meet us and to listen to our grievances,” Njoki said.\n“We don’t take it for granted, and I appreciate him because we are seeing things changing, and then even he’s the first minister to meet us for over 13 years.”\nDuring her five-day visit, Njoki, who is studying communications at the University of Nairobi, gave media interviews to raise the profile of the case, and also appeared on a panel at the House of Commons.\nShe sat alongside speakers including Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in international law and extradition, and Tessa Gregory, the UK lawyer acting for Wanjiru’s family.\nNjoki said she hoped her advocacy work would not only bring justice for her aunt, but improve the lives of women in Kenya. “This is a way of changing things, just small steps,” she said. “It’s a sign of hope that everything is possible. Despite where you come from, your background doesn’t have to define you.”\nHealey said: “Six months since our first meeting in Kenya, I was pleased to welcome the niece of the late Agnes Wanjiru, Esther Njoki, to London, to reiterate our government’s steadfast support for her family’s long and painful fight for justice.\n“I want to pay tribute to Esther, who is an extraordinary spokesperson for her family, and for women who have suffered violence.”\nHe added: “We reflected on the significant progress made in recent months, with the case file being handed to the director of public prosecutions in April and a charging decision being made last month\n“Our government will continue to do everything we can to support the Kenyan investigation, secure a resolution to this case and finally bring peace to Esther and her grieving family.”",

    "body": "Madagascar’s new military ruler will be sworn in as the country’s president on Friday, the military said on Wednesday, as the African Union suspended the island nation after a coup that ousted President Andry Rajoelina.\nThe Indian Ocean nation has been plunged into its worst political upheaval in years after the elite Capsat army unit assumed power on Tuesday, moments after parliament voted to impeach Rajoelina, who appeared to have fled the country as street protests escalated.\nIt becomes the latest former French colony to fall under military control since 2020, after coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Gabon and Guinea.\nCapsat commander Col Michael Randrianirina, confirmed as president by the top court, said on Wednesday that the transition to civilian leadership would take under two years and include the restructuring of major institutions.\n“It wasn’t a coup, it was a case of taking responsibility because the country was on the brink of collapse,” he said, having pledged elections in 18 to 24 months and told local media that consultations were under way to appoint a prime minister and form a new government.\nThe transition would be overseen by a committee of officers from the army, gendarmerie and police.\nRandrianirina “will be sworn in as president of the refoundation of the Republic of Madagascar during a solemn hearing of the high constitutional court” on 17 October, the country’s military rulers said in a statement published on social media by a state television station.\nRandrianirina has long been a vocal critic of Rajoelina’s administration and was reportedly imprisoned for several months in 2023 for plotting a coup.\nThe swift takeover has drawn international concern. The African Union on Wednesday told AFP it was suspending Madagascar “with immediate effect”, while the UN said it was “deeply concerned by the unconstitutional change of power”.\nFrance said in a statement that it was “essential that democracy, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law be scrupulously upheld”.\nA spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said all actors needed to “act with caution in this currently somewhat confusing situation”, while Russia called for “exercising restraint and preventing bloodshed”.\nThe security body of regional SADC grouping – of which Rajoelina was holding the rotating presidency – also expressed concern.\nThe capital, Antananarivo, remained calm late on Wednesday, though uncertainty lingered over what might happen next.\nA concert was held on the symbolic Place du 13 Mai square, in front of the city hall, where thousands of protesters and armed vehicles had clashed days earlier.\nThe youth-led Gen Z movement that initiated the protests on 25 September over lack of water and energy before they later swelled into broader anger at the political elite have welcomed the intervention of Randrianirina.\nThe colonel had said he was “ready to talk to the youth and we are ready to answer the call”, Gen Z said in a post on Facebook, reiterating its calls for “systemic change”.\n“We’re worried about what comes next, but we’re savouring this first victory that gave us hope,” 26-year-old Fenitra Razafindramanga, captain of Madagascar’s national rugby team, told AFP.\nIn the northern city of Antsiranana, an entrepreneur who identified herself only as Muriella was relieved that Rajoelina was no longer in power.\n“It feels like we’ve just been released from prison,” she told AFP, adding: “This is also a message to his successor: learn from this and don’t make the same mistakes.”",

    "body": "The veteran Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, who ran five times for the presidency and had a profound influence on the country’s politics, has died aged 80 in India.\nOdinga was in the southern city of Kochi for treatment. The Press Trust of India news agency reported that he had a cardiac arrest during a morning walk.\nIn an address to the nation on Wednesday, Kenya’s president, William Ruto, described Odinga as “a once-in-a-generation leader”, “a giant of democracy” and “a tireless warrior of good governance”.\nHe said: “In his passing, we have lost a patriot of uncommon courage, a pan-Africanist, a unifier who sought peace and unity above power and self-gain, an unceasing servant of the people who gave his all for the promise of a better Kenya.”\nRuto declared seven national days of mourning and said Odinga would be accorded a state funeral.\nAn enduring opposition figure in Kenyan politics, Odinga became an MP in 1992 and his most recent run for the presidency was in 2022.\nHis narrow loss to Mwai Kibaki in the disputed 2007 election triggered unrest that killed about 1,300 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. He became prime minister in 2008 in a national unity government headed by Kibaki as part of a deal to end the bloodshed.\nIn 1982, Odinga, a son of Kenya’s first vice-president, Oginga Odinga, was charged with treason in connection with a coup against the then president, Daniel arap Moi, and detained without trial for six years.\nAn ardent political activist, he was arrested many times during Moi’s administration for fighting against his one-party rule.\nHis fight for democracy helped the country achieve two milestone political reforms: changing to a multiparty democracy in 1991, and enacting a new constitution in 2010.\nRuto said in his address: “For decades, Raila dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice, equity, and freedom. He endured detention and persecution so that this nation might know and enjoy democracy.”\nA hugely popular figure, Odinga was able to mobilise massive crowds to attend his rallies, and supporters called him Baba – “father” in Swahili. As news of his death reached the streets, hundreds of supporters from the Nairobi neighbourhood of Kibera, where he was MP, made their way in a procession to his home in the Karen neighbourhood.\nIn reaction to youth-led anti-government protests last year, he entered an agreement with the president, William Ruto, under which his Orange Democratic Movement party became part of a “broad-based government” and gained a role in policymaking.\nTributes have poured in for the former prime minister. The former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta said: “We have lost a father to the nation, a steadfast champion for the people, and a true son of Kenya. His legacy is not just in the political battles he fought, but in the peace he helped build. It is etched in the very fabric of our nation.”\nThe former chief justice and current presidential aspirant David Maraga said he was shocked by news of Odinga’s death. He described him as “a patriot, a pan-Africanist, a democrat and a leader who made significant contributions to democracy in Kenya and in Africa”.\n“Kenya has lost one of its most formidable leaders who shaped the trajectory of our beloved country. Africa has lost a leading voice in pushing for peace, security and development. The world has lost a great leader,” he said.\nMahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chair of the African Union Commission, said Odinga was “a steadfast champion of democracy, good governance, and people-centred development”. He said: “His decades-long commitment to justice, pluralism, and democratic reform left an indelible mark not only on Kenya but across the African continent.”\nThe Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said Odinga was a “towering statesman”. Condolences were also offered by Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and the Tanzanian president, Samia Suluhu Hassan, who described Odinga’s death as a tragedy “not just for Kenya, but for all of us”.",

    "body": "The besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher has been declared “uninhabitable” with new data indicating most homes are destroyed and critical levels of malnourishment among people trapped there.\nThe stark assessment comes as the city endures constant artillery and drone attacks, shoehorning its 250,000 starving people into a shrinking urban enclave.\nFor 549 days El Fasher has been surrounded by fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who have prevented all humanitarian access entering the city as it attempts to seize the army’s last stronghold in west Sudan.\nTestimonies from households encompassing almost 900 people who recently fled the city – countless others have been abducted and killed by the RSF for trying to escape – confirm a population “pushed to the edge of survival”.\nThe interviews, coordinated last month by US-based medical humanitarian group MedGlobal, offer a first detailed assessment of life inside the siege.\nMore than 90% reported their homes had been destroyed, damaged or looted before they fled. A quarter of households had experienced a death within the previous three months.\nHealth screenings on those who reached the town of Al Dabbah, Northern State, after walking for days from El Fasher, found acute and widespread levels of malnutrition. Three-quarters of escapers said they “never or rarely” had food because of the siege. Half revealed that they “never or rarely” had access to water.\nMedGlobal’s executive director, Joseph Belliveau, said: “The 500-day siege of El Fasher has pushed its inhabitants to the edge of survival.\n“Some of those who recently arrived to Northern State shared what life was like in El Fasher: ubiquitous violence, destroyed homes, severe shortages of food and water, and almost no access to healthcare.\n“As one woman put it: ‘In El Fasher I smell death rather than life and hope.’”\nEl Fasher is facing intensifying RSF artillery and drone attacks with one salvo last weekend striking a displacement shelter, killing at least 57 people, including 22 women and 17 children.\nThree-quarters of residents told MedGlobal they had been forced to move home at least three times while 81% said they “never felt safe” moving around the city.\n“The destruction of homes and health infrastructure has made El Fasher uninhabitable,” said MedGlobal.\nHope that the siege might end grew last month when US president Donald Trump’s senior adviser for African affairs, Massad Boulos, claimed he and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – which has been repeatedly accused of supporting the RSF – had secured an agreement to allow aid into the city.\nThose efforts appear to have collapsed, with the RSF instead tightening its siege. El Fasher is now fully encircled by huge earthen berms (raised embankments), making it even harder for civilians to escape.\nHowever, in a recent unexpected twist – and with the city believed to be on the brink of collapse – airdrops by the Sudanese military have temporarily resupplied those defending the city.\nYet food remains scarce, with MedGlobal’s screenings finding one in five children under five was acutely malnourished. Children under 18 months old were most affected, with 27.5% acutely malnourished.\nIn addition, 38% of pregnant and lactating women were malnourished, undermining maternal health and increasing the risk of infants being born prematurely or underweight. The highest rates were recorded among adolescent girls with 60% of those aged 15 to 19 experiencing what MedGlobal described as “wasting”.\nAlthough El Fasher is cut off from the outside world by communications blackouts – 86% reported “no or rare access” to phones or internet – the Guardian has maintained contact with a number of people in the city.\nAbdessalam Kitir, 50, described using milk from his surviving goat – the other was killed in a drone attack last month – to keep alive a newborn whose entire family died after an RSF shell flattened their home.\n“The baby lost his mother and father and three brothers and sisters. He was evacuated to the hospital,” said Kitir.\nBut even El Fasher’s last remaining hospital – al Saudi – is being routinely targeted with 13 people killed last week when the RSF shelled it.\nIndiscriminate shelling means many families spend days in trenches or underground bunkers. Half said they had been victims of violence while 71% had witnessed violence against neighbours and others in the city.\nThe UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemned the continued killing of people in El Fasher last week.\nThe Sudanese military is also accused of myriad war crimes, most recently when at least 16 people died in one of its drone attacks on a town to the east of El Fasher several days ago.\nOn Tuesday, the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights described Sudan’s conflict as a “war on children”.\nLawyers at the centre said children were subject to mass starvation, forced displacement and deliberate attacks.\nThey added that states such as the UAE – which denies supporting the RSF – are in violation of their obligations under the genocide convention for their role in the war.\nIn a report published on Wednesday by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), the UK government was praised for making the Sudan crisis a priority and doubling aid to more than £230m last year.",

    "body": "Donald Trump used an expletive to threaten the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, on Friday, claiming that the leftist autocrat had offered major concessions to appease the US.\nThe US president was speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday during a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nAsked about reports that Maduro offered “everything in his country, all the natural resources” to ease tensions, Trump agreed: “He’s offered everything; you’re right. You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States.”\nMaduro, who came to power in 2013, has recently shored up his security powers and deployed tens of thousands of troops around the country. He also accused Trump of seeking regime change, an allegation the US president has downplayed.\nLast week the New York Times reported that Maduro offered a stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in recent months to stave off mounting pressure from the US.\nMeanwhile, Venezuelan government officials are said to have floated a plan in which Maduro would eventually leave office. The Miami Herald newspaper reported that Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother Jorge, who is president of the national assembly, had funneled proposals through intermediaries in Qatar to present themselves to Washington as a “more acceptable” alternative.\nThe US has acknowledged carrying out at least five strikes on vessels near Venezuela that it says were transporting drugs, killing at least 27 people.\nA sixth strike targeted a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean on Thursday, and in what is believed to be the first such case, there were survivors among the crew, who were reportedly rescued and are being held on a navy ship.\nOne source told Reuters that the vessel struck on Thursday moved below the water and was possibly a semi-submersible, which is a submarine-like vessel used by drug traffickers to avoid detection.\nTrump confirmed to reporters: “We attacked a submarine. That was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs – just so you understand.”\nHe added: “This was not an innocent group of people. I don’t know too many people that have submarines and that was an attack on a drug-carrying loaded-up submarine.”\nThe secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who was also present, did not dispute that there were survivors and repeatedly said details would be forthcoming.\nThe US has described some of the victims in the first five strikes as Venezuelans, while the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has suggested some were from his country. In Trinidad, family members of one man believed killed in a strike this week have demanded proof he was a drug trafficker.\nVenezuela’s government has said the strikes are illegal, amount to murder and are an aggression against the country.\nTrump has justified the strikes by asserting that the US is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the George W Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the September 11 attacks.\nBut legal scholars have warned that the president’s use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorisation of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law.\nJuanita Goebertus Estrada, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions.\n“The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury,” she said.\nThe strikes have caused unease among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they had not received sufficient information on how the strikes were being conducted.\nFriday’s outburst was not the first that Trump has peppered the language of diplomacy with profanities. In June, frustrated with Israel and Iran attacking each other after a ceasefire, he told a group of reporters that the countries had “been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the fuck they’re doing”.",

    "body": "The US has seized survivors of a military strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean, the first since Donald Trump began launching deadly attacks in the region last month, according to officials in Washington.\nTrump later confirmed the attack, telling reporters that the targeted vessel was a narco-submarine.\n“We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs,” Trump said while hosting the Ukrainian president at the White House.\nColombian drug lords first started using narco-subs – custom-made semi-submersibles that travel just under the surface of the water – to smuggle cocaine through the Caribbean towards Mexico and the US in the 1980s.\nMore recently, crime bosses have become far more ambitious, commissioning fibreglass creations to ship huge hauls of cocaine over thousands of miles.\nThursday’s attack is believed to be at least the sixth strike in the waters off Venezuela since early September, and the first to result in survivors who were picked up by the US military. It was not immediately clear what would be done with the survivors, who the officials said were being held on a US navy vessel.\nThey confirmed the strike on the condition of anonymity because it has not yet been publicly acknowledged by the Trump administration.\nThis strike on Thursday brings the death toll from the US military action against vessels in the region to at least 28.\nTrump justified the strikes by asserting that the United States was engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a “war on terror” after the September 11 attacks in 2001. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.\nThe president’s use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars say.\nThe survivors of this strike now face an unclear future and legal landscape, including questions about whether they are now considered to be prisoners of war or defendants in a criminal case. The White House did not comment on the strike.\nJuanita Goebertus Estrada, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions.\n“The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury.\n“In the different recent strikes conducted in the Caribbean, the US authorities made no effort to minimize harm and have not sought to demonstrate that the individuals aboard vessels posed any imminent threat to life,” she said.\nThe strikes come against the backdrop of a US military buildup in the Caribbean that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter jets, a nuclear submarine and about 6,500 troops as Trump escalates a standoff with the Venezuelan government.\nOn Wednesday, Trump disclosed he had authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the United States is attempting to topple Maduro.\nThe strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they have not received sufficient information on how the strikes are being conducted. A classified briefing for senators on the Senate armed services committee earlier this month did not include representatives from intelligence agencies or the military command structure of countries in South and Central America.\nHowever, most Senate Republicans stood behind the administration last week when a vote on a war powers resolution was brought up, which would have required the administration to gain approval from Congress before conducting more strikes.\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting",

    "body": "Relatives of two men from Trinidad believed to have been killed in a US military strike on a boat in the Caribbean have accused Donald Trump of “killing poor people” without due process and are demanding justice.\nChad “Charpo” Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, from the fishing village of Las Cuevas in northern Trinidad, are thought to be among six people killed in a US airstrike on a boat allegedly transporting drugs from Venezuela.\nTrump has described the six killed as “narcoterrorists”, claiming that “intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics”. But speaking to the Guardian at a wake for the two men, Joseph’s cousin La Toya, 42, said he was denied the basic right to due process and accused the Trinidad and Tobago government of giving up its sovereignty to the US.\n“Everybody have a right to due process and due process wasn’t given. It don’t look like we running under our government no more when it comes to the waters – that’s not Trinidad waters,” she said, questioning why US officials decided to destroy the boat rather than detain and question its occupants.\nAt a wake for the two men late on Thursday, family and community members said they felt betrayed by their own government and at the mercy of a Trump administration that has been given unfettered access to their waters.\n“I just want to know why Donald Trump killing poor people just so,” Joseph’s uncle, known only as “Dollars”, said. “Just because he going after the people gas and their oil. He going after people riches and killing poor people children.”\nLynette Burnley, Joseph’s aunt, said the family had received no communication from the Trinidad government since reports of her nephew’s death first emerged.\n“That make me feel a kind of way too,” Burnley said. “People coming from international, all over, [calling us but] not right here in Trinidad. They real poor, they let us down.”\nOn Thursday, Trinidad’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, who has previously expressed strong support for a US military operation in the region, avoided questions from reporters about the US airstrike that is thought to have killed Joseph and Samaroo.\n“Just imagine, the prime minister … They asking she about this. She never even make a statement,” Burnley said, adding that it felt as if Joseph and Samaroo were being treated like “they did not exist”.\nJoseph’s grandmother Christine Clement said she was very close to him. He moved from his mother’s home in another fishing village, Matelot, and came to live with her.\nShe said the only support she had had was from the community.\n“Everybody hurt, because in this community everybody is family and friends and everybody close … Our own police service, nobody come and ask a question. There’s no investigation, nothing,” she said, adding she was trying to stay calm and monitor her blood pressure.\nLess is known in the village about Samaroo, who was released from prison in 2021 after serving time for his role in a 2009 murder of a street vendor. Most only knew him by his last name and said he would often try to help out in any way he could with odd jobs and mechanics, but especially animals.\nWith no body to bury, family and friends are planning a memorial mass. “I talked to the priest and I let him know what went on,” Burnley said. “Next week Wednesday will be the nine days. He coming home here to keep a mass, five o’clock.”\nOn Thursday, US media reported another strike on a boat in the Caribbean, from which there reportedly are survivors. At least 27 people have been killed in previous attacks off the coast of Venezuela, which the Trump administration says are necessary to protect the United States from narcotics smuggled from Venezuela, but which UN experts and human rights groups have described as extrajudicial killings.\nLast month, fishers in Las Cuevas told the Guardian that they were afraid of being caught in the crossfire amid Trump’s “war on drugs” in the region. Instead of their usual route, heading west toward Venezuela, fishers said they now head east, staying close to the coast of Trinidad. On Thursday, villagers told the Guardian that the fishers now don’t want to go out at all.\nActivist David Abdulah, speaking for the regional executive committee for the Assembly of Caribbean People, stood outside the US embassy in Port of Spain on Thursday declaring that the Caribbean must remain a “zone of peace”.\nAlluding to Washington’s history of interference in Haiti and Latin America, and its invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983, Abdulah warned that there was an imminent threat to the region’s sovereignty and peace.\nLaunching a regional declaration condemning renewed US militarisation, he said: “The people of the Caribbean must stand firm against any attempt to drag us into war.”\nJuanita Goebertus Estrada, Americas director at Human Rights Watch said the attacks violated international human rights law and amounted to extrajudicial executions.\n“The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago or with alleged criminal groups involved. Under human rights law standards, officials engaging in law enforcement must seek to minimize injury and preserve human life. They may use lethal force only when strictly unavoidable to protect against an imminent threat of death or serious injury.\n”In the different recent strikes conducted in the Caribbean, the US authorities made no effort to minimize harm and have not sought to demonstrate that the individuals aboard vessels posed any imminent threat to life,” she said.",

    "body": "Governments across Latin America are stepping up efforts to vaccinate their populations against measles, as outbreaks in North America drive a 34-fold increase in the number of cases reported in the region this year.\nMeasles cases have surged worldwide to a 25-year high, due to low vaccine coverage and the spread of misinformation about vaccine safety. However, there is added concern in parts of Latin America over unequal access to healthcare and the worrying situation in the US, which is facing its worst measles outbreak in decades following a reversal of vaccine policy led by Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n“The US’s political position in relation to health and vaccination is an outrage,” said Rosana Richtmann, an infectious disease doctor and coordinator of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Disease’s immunisation committee. “It’s a problem for us.”\nMeasles was successfully eliminated from the Americas in 2016, and then again in 2024, but the continent is now at risk of losing its measles-free status. There have been 11,668 cases reported across 10 countries in North and Latin America, according to the latest data from the Pan-American Health Organization (Paho).\nMore than half of these cases are in the US and Canada, with three deaths in the US and two in Canada so far.\nMexico is the hardest-hit country in Latin America, with more than 4,800 cases and 22 deaths, followed by Bolivia with 354 cases. Other countries, including Brazil, Belize and Paraguay, are dealing with a few dozen infections linked to imported cases.\nConcern over high numbers of cases in North America has led the Brazilian health ministry to focus more on the highly contagious disease with a nationwide vaccination campaign launched for children and teenagers in October. Adults who did not have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as children are also being offered the jab.\nBrazil also has protocols in place to respond swiftly to individual cases. When a nine-year-old tested positive for measles on 7 October in Várzea Grande, health authorities were swift to act. Nurses kitted out in protective gear visited the child’s school and worked quickly to implement “ring vaccination”, inoculating everyone who had been in contact with her.\nThe city’s health teams have also been going from door to door to identify unvaccinated people and holding vaccination drives in a shopping centre and the international airport.\nRichtmann said the biggest fear was imported cases. “We are much more worried about Brazilians travelling to Europe, to the US or Canada [catching measles and bringing it back], than about those who live here,” she said.\nAmira Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Virginia’s George Mason University, agreed that the outbreaks in the US posed a threat to neighbouring countries.\n“Now suddenly, you’re more likely to run into someone who has some kind of infectious disease [in the US]. You visit the US, you go home with souvenirs – and you might also go home with measles,” she said.\nMexico’s first measles case in February was imported from Texas by an unvaccinated Mennonite boy. Bolivia’s first cases also spread through pockets of unvaccinated people living in Mennonite settlements.\nMennonites are Anabaptist Christian communities of European descent who reject many aspects of modern life, including vaccines.\nDaniel Salas, executive manager of Paho’s special programme for comprehensive immunisation, said: “Having close-knit communities that are often reluctant to receive vaccinations and having large flows [of people] from country to country through the region are aggravating factors.”\nHealth authorities should identify communities resistant to vaccination and target their efforts there, Salas said.\nThere is no cure for measles, which can lead to serious complications and even death, but it is easily preventable with two doses of the MMR vaccine, which provides 97% protection.\nMMR vaccination rates in Latin America fell during the Covid pandemic and the years leading up to it but have recovered since 2022, reaching 86% last year, according to the World Bank. However, this remains below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity, with a lag in uptake of second doses and significant disparities between countries and within them.\nLack of information and access to heathcare has contributed to lower vaccination rates, but doctors also blame the influence of the growing anti-vaxxer movement in the US.\n“A lot of South American countries look to the US,” said Carlos Paz, head of infectious diseases at the Mario Ortiz Suárez paediatric hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where 80% of the country’s cases have been reported.\n“The population sees what a US minister says about vaccines, and some people start to say, ‘well, we shouldn’t get vaccinated here either’,” he said.\nWhile the US health secretary did endorse the MMR vaccine after an outbreak in Texas in April, Kennedy has also spread misleading information about it and misinformation about measles treatment.\nThis month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now led by a biotech investor, suggested the MMR vaccine should be given as three separate jabs, even though the safety and efficacy of combined shots have been demonstrated by decades of research and going against the CDC’s own longstanding advice.\nBolivia declared a national health emergency in June, extended school holidays to avoid contact between children, and launched a widespread vaccination drive, relying partly on donations from Brazil, India and Chile. But coverage in October had still only reached 45%, while the government still has 1.6m doses available.\n“We’ve been campaigning to increase the vaccination rate. Each doctor, each paediatrician, is a soldier advocating for vaccination,” said Paz.",

Police fired teargas while some protesters hurled fireworks, rocks and burning objects.\n“Everyone must go!” protesters chanted when they reached congress and tried to tear down metal barriers protecting the building, leading to clashes.\nA 32-year-old man, Eduardo Mauricio Ruiz, was killed during the protest and his death would be investigated, said Fernando Losada, a representative from the country’s ombudsman’s office. Peru’s prosecutor’s office said Ruiz died after being shot.\nJerí expressed regret over Ruiz’s death in a post on X, saying the death would be “objectively” investigated. He blamed violence on “delinquents who infiltrated a peaceful demonstration to sow chaos”.\n“The full force of the law will be on them,” he said.\nAfter attending a meeting about the protests at congress on Thursday afternoon, Jerí said he would ask congress for “authority to legislate on public safety issues”.\nJerí said one focus would be prison reform, but did not elaborate on what those powers would entail.\nSpeaking to the unicameral congress soon after, the newly appointed interior minister, Vicente Tiburcio, said the government would push for comprehensive reform to the national police, adding that 89 police and 22 civilians had been injured during the protest and 11 people were detained.\nThe interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the police reform or Jerí’s request for expanded legislative powers.\nWednesday’s protests were a bellwether for how Jerí’s nascent presidency – which ends next July due to scheduled elections – could play out.\nJerí, 38, has promised to make crime his top priority but has faced a number of scandals, including corruption allegations and a now-shelved investigation for sexual assault. Jerí has denied wrongdoing in both cases and expressed willingness to cooperate with any corruption investigation.\nBoluarte faced widespread protests after she assumed power in late 2022, leading to dozens of deaths and a plunge in her popularity levels, which oscillated between 2% and 4% in the days leading up to her ouster.\nCongress – which was headed by Jerí before he became president – is almost equally unpopular, with a single-digit approval rating.",

    "body": "European stock markets fell on Friday and gold hit a record high after two US regional banks said they had been exposed to millions of dollars of bad loans and alleged fraud.\nSigns of credit stress rattled markets across Europe and Asia. In London the FTSE 100 fell 0.9%, Germany’s Dax fell 1.8%, Italy’s FTSE Mib fell 1.5%, the Ibex in Spain was off 0.3% and France’s Cac 40 dropped 0.2%.\nMany of the biggest fallers were banks. In the UK, nearly £11bn was wiped off the value of the five largest listed banks. Barclays was the worst hit, with shares closing down nearly 6%.\nMore widely, €37.4bn (£32bn) was wiped off the pan-European banking industry, including the UK.\nSpain’s Banco Sabadell fell by 6.78%, followed by Germany’s Deutsche Bank, which shed 6%.\nConcerns over credit stress in the network of loans to businesses across the world’s largest economy fuelled heavy losses on Wall Street on Thursday, followed by Asian markets, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 1.6% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropping 2%. US markets were calmer on Friday morning trading on Wall Street.\nJittery investors turned to safe haven assets, with gold hitting a new record of $4,378 (£3,262) an ounce, a weekly gain of almost 8.5%, its biggest since the 2008 financial crisis.\nUS banking stocks plunged on Thursday after Zions Bancorporation, a Utah-based lender, said it would write off $50m on two loans, and the Phoenix-headquartered Western Alliance said it had started legal proceedings over a bad loan said to be worth $100m.\nShares in Zions plunged by more than 10%, while Western Alliance Bancorp dropped more than 9%.\n“While this was an ostensibly isolated story at two banks each with less than a $10bn market cap, the event drew inevitable comparisons to the regional bank stress that followed the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank [SVB] in 2023,” said Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “[That] raised broader questions over potential credit quality issues after a lengthy period of elevated rates and expansion in private credit.”\nThe California-based SVB was the 16th biggest bank in the US, a $212bn lender popular with the tech sector. Its abrupt collapse triggered the most significant financial crisis since 2008.\nWhile SVB’s underlying issues stemmed from earlier investment decisions, the collapse occurred when it announced a $1.75bn capital raising, telling investors it needed to plug a hole caused by the sale of its loss-making bond portfolio.\nThis caused a run on the bank as clients became alarmed that it was short of capital. Two days later SVB collapsed, marking the largest bank failure in the US since the global financial crisis.\nReid said that markets were especially wary of a domino effect, as the issues faced by the two banks followed the bankruptcy of the sub-prime automotive lender Tricolor last month.\nThe US regional banking industry has been under scrutiny after First Brands, an auto parts supplier, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September over creditor concerns.\nIn its bankruptcy filing, First Brands disclosed that it had at least $10bn to $50bn in liabilities against $1bn to $10bn in assets, the product of what appeared to be risky off-balance-sheet financing.\nRichard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “There are increasing signs of storm clouds gathering over markets, with little relief from the building wall of worry.\n“Already grappling with stretched stock valuations in the AI space, an unresolved government shutdown and a deteriorating relationship between Beijing and Washington, investors were exposed to a new source of concern in the form of lending practices and bad loans for US regional banks.”\nDerren Nathan, the head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Despite growing hopes of further rate cuts this year, attention is turning to the underlying health of the economy, as emerging credit losses among America’s regional banks raised further questions about lending practices.”\nThe VIX index, which tracks volatility in the markets, surged by more than 22% on Thursday to its highest closing level since April. The so-called “fear index” rose a further 6% on Friday morning.\nEarlier this week, Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US investment bank JP Morgan, rather presciently said that more “cockroaches” could emerge after the collapse of Tricolor and First Brands.",

    "body": "The Izu Islands in Japan have endured another powerful blow as Typhoon Nakri swept through on Monday, following in the footsteps of Typhoon Halong, which struck a week earlier.\nOfficials on Hachijojima Island, south of Tokyo, reported disruption and damage to about 220 homes after the storm brought 37mm (1.5in) of rain in one hour and gusts of up to 95mph (152km/h). Airport operations were disrupted, infrastructure damaged, and heavy rainfall caused landslides across the island chain. The typhoon also generated 9-metre waves, creating dangerous coastal conditions. Off the Pacific coast in Oiso, in Kanagawa prefecture, three men were swept away while fishing, one of whom has been confirmed dead.\nNakri has since transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, weakening as it moved eastwards over cooler north Pacific waters, with wind speeds dropping to about 65mph as of Thursday. Riding the jet stream, its remnants are on track to reach British Columbia, Canada, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and storm surges.\nA week earlier, Halong had unleashed more than 200mm of rain in three hours, as maximum sustained winds reached 122mph. By late morning last Thursday, rainfall totals reached 349mm, shattering the 24-hour record. The typhoon’s remnants then crossed the north Pacific and reached Alaska on Sunday, bringing a record-breaking 2-metre storm surge.\nThe coastal villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were the hardest hit. One person died, homes were destroyed, and about 1,500 people were forced into shelters. Alaska experienced one of the largest airlifts in its history to evacuate displaced residents. Halong stands as one of the most powerful storms the region has experienced. Its rapid intensification was fuelled by unusually warm north Pacific waters, which provided extra heat and moisture.\nMeanwhile, Mexico endured a double blow last week as the remnants of Hurricane Priscilla and Tropical Storm Raymond converged, dumping about 609mm of rain in four days across central and eastern regions.\nSteered by a dip in the jet stream, both systems hit the same area in quick succession. The first deluge from Priscilla left the ground saturated, intensifying flooding when Raymond arrived.\nMore than 300 communities were affected by landslides and overflowing rivers. As of Wednesday, 66 people have been confirmed dead and 75 are still missing. Rescue and recovery operations are continuing, with stagnant flood waters raising health concerns in isolated areas.",

The conflict came after months or retaliatory actions including Cambodia banning the import of Thai films and fruit, and a Thai protester throwing fish sauce of a portrait of Hun Sen.\nThe ceasefire was announced after US president Donald Trump said he had called both countries and warned that trade negotiations would be paused until the fighting ceased.\nTrump is expected to oversee a formal peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia later this month.\nThe pushback against the alleged ghost-like broadcasts come as Thailand has accused Cambodia of laying new mines along the border, Reuters has reported. Landmine detonations, which have maimed at least six Thai soldiers since July, triggered the clashes between the two nations.\nCambodia denies the accusations and says Thai soldiers stepped on ordnances planted during a decades-long civil war that left it as one of the world’s most heavily mined countries.",

That includes constructive and robust engagement at a variety of levels.”\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly pulled the charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, last month. The CPS argued that the government had not provided sufficient evidence that China represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”.\nStarmer published the three witness statements submitted by a deputy national security adviser, Matthew Collins, to prosecutors on Wednesday after accusations he had interfered with the trial to protect the UK’s trading relationship with China.\nIn a letter to the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, on Thursday, the prime minister rejected Tory claims that Powell had a role in shaping the evidence that ultimately led the case to collapse.\nHe wrote that while Powell attended a meeting about the case with senior Whitehall officials in September, “these discussions were based on the working assumption that the case would proceed – which was the desired outcome of the government – and focused on how to handle the implications”. The meeting, on 1 September, took place nearly a month after Collins submitted his final witness statement to the CPS on 4 August.\nPowell last travelled to Beijing in mid-July where he met China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi. The Chinese government said they had discussed the UK government’s desire for “a consistent, lasting and mutually respectful relationship”.\nPhillipson is planning to travel to China later this year for talks on education, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Vallance’s trip next month, which was first reported by PoliticsHome, is to hold a formal, in-person forum on science, innovation and technology for the first time since 2018. Virtual talks were held in 2021.\nThe visits are the latest examples of high-level engagement between the UK and China which has stepped up since Labour entered power. Rishi Sunak’s administration sought to pursue a similar approach but was hamstrung by political instability and opposition from hawkish Tory backbenchers.\nPlans are being drawn up for Starmer to make a bilateral trip to China next year, possibly in mid-February. Donald Trump has also said he intends to make a trip to China early next year, which could affect the timing of Starmer’s visit if it goes ahead.\nThe last UK prime minister to visit China was Theresa May in 2018, when ministers were still talking about a “golden era” in relations with the country.\nRachel Reeves, the chancellor, travelled to China with a business delegation in January and unveiled £600m in investment. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, have also visited China for talks over the past year. Senior Chinese government figures made several visits to the UK in the same period.\nThis week, Oliver Robbins, the permanent secretary of the Foreign Office, became the latest senior government figure to travel to Beijing. Part of his brief has been to discuss much-needed refurbishment to Britain’s embassy in Beijing, which China is blocking while the fate of its own new embassy is being decided.\nMinisters have come under pressure over the implications of their rapprochement for national security.\nThe Guardian revealed earlier this month that China threatened to retaliate against plans to target parts of its security apparatus under foreign influence rules. Chinese officials told the Foreign Office that the move would have negative consequences for relations.",

    "body": "A conservation charity known for its anti-renewables stance has made submissions to federal and state inquiries that name non-existent government authorities and a nonexistent windfarm, and cite scientific articles that the supposed publisher says don’t exist, a Guardian Australia investigation has found.\nTwo US-based academics and experts said Rainforest Reserves Australia’s (RRA) claims in submissions about their work were “100% misleading” and “absurd”.\nIn comments sent via RRA, the organisation’s submission writer has admitted using AI to help write more than 100 submissions to councils and state and federal governments since August 2024, and to also using AI to answer questions from the Guardian.\nRRA came to prominence opposing a small number of windfarm projects in north Queensland, but has become more vocal against renewable energy generally and is a popular voice among conservatives and rightwing media.\nThe Nationals leader, David Littleproud, last month celebrated RRA analysis on the extent of renewable energy installations around Australia. An open letter criticising the Australian government’s focus on renewable energy coordinated by RRA, which is based in far north Queensland, has been signed by several notable Australians, including the energy entrepreneur Trevor St Baker, Dick Smith, the Indigenous advocate Warren Mundine and several nuclear energy advocates.\nThe Guardian is not suggesting the analysis or open letter were developed using AI.\n‘100% misleading’\nRRA made a submission to the Senate inquiry on misinformation and disinformation in the climate change and energy debate.\nThe submission said Australia’s climate and energy policy was being “undermined by a persistent failure to confront misinformation” and plans to reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions relied on “incomplete science, policy capture, and the systematic omission of ecological costs (Brulle, 2014; Oreskes and Conway, 2010)”.\nProf Naomi Oreskes is a Harvard science historian and an expert on science misinformation who co-authored the 2010 book Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming, which the submission cites.\n“Merchants of Doubt does not support that claim,” Oreskes said, and “net zero” was not discussed in her book.\nShe said: “It is true that no technology is 100% impact free. But some technologies are far worse than others, and the passage cites my work in a way that is 100% misleading.”\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nThe same submission points to two publications from Prof Bob Brulle of Brown University – an expert on the global network of groups working to slow action on climate change. The submission said Brulle’s work supported a claim that advocacy for renewable energy was often “devoid of underlying context”.\n“While the citations are real, neither paper remotely addresses the issues that the [submission] discusses,” Brulle said.\n“The citations are totally misleading. I have never written on these topics in any of my papers. To say that these citations support [RRA’s] argument is absurd.”\nRRA also made submissions to a Senate inquiry into Pfas chemicals and a NSW parliamentary inquiry on Pfas in waterways. Both claimed solar panels and wind turbines were releasing so-called forever chemicals into the environment.\nThe submissions cited two papers from the Journal of Cleaner Production as evidence, but the Guardian could not find the papers.\nA spokesperson for the journal’s publisher, Elsevier, said: “These references appear to be hallucinated and do not exist – we have not found any articles with those titles published in Elsevier journals.”\nNonexistent windfarm\nRRA’s website says its submissions are developed by a volunteer, Anne S Smith who, the charity says, “continues to call for policy grounded in truth, science, and stewardship not ideology”. Smith is described on the RRA website as a volunteer and an environmental research strategist.\nIn two submissions published on its website, both with the same date, RRA opposed a windfarm development in Queensland called Moonlight Range that was ultimately rejected by the state government.\nOne submission, authored by Smith, refers to a report from 2023 produced by the “Queensland Environmental Protection Agency” – an agency that has not existed since 2009.\nIt also refers to the “Australian Regional Planning Commission” and the “Queensland Planning Authority” – neither of which exists.\nThe other submission, which does not name an author, claimed “case studies from the Oakey Wind Farm in Queensland” had reported “widespread contamination” at the site. But there is no windfarm in Oakey and the cited “Oakey Wind Farm Contamination Report” does not exist.\nSome properties in the town were contaminated by Pfas chemicals used in firefighting foam at a defence base.\nDr Aaron Snoswell, a senior research fellow in AI accountability at the Queensland University of Technology’s GenAI Lab, put a small sample of the submissions through checking platforms – which also run on AI.\n“Looking at some of these documents, there were large portions of text that the platforms were very confident were AI generated,” he said.\nHe said inconsistencies in references “is a classic mistake that’s made by AI systems”.\nThe use of AI was not in itself a problem, he said, but AI-generated work needed to be double checked.\nCam Walker, the campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth Australia, reviewed the RRA submissions and said they contained “fabrications that corrupt the evidence base that decision-makers and communities rely on”.\n“We’ve found multiple submissions across different renewable energy projects, all authored by the same person from RRA … all showing the same pattern of fake citations,” he said.\n“When you cite a government department that was abolished 16 years ago, or reference reports that don’t exist, that’s not community representation. It’s a misrepresentation.”\nHe said Friends of the Earth had “genuine concerns about ensuring renewable energy is planned properly” but the submissions from RRA “poisons the well for legitimate environmental concerns”.\nGuardian Australia’s questions to RRA were forwarded to Smith, who sent a 1,500-word response that she later acknowledged had been generated with the help of AI.\nFor the submissions, she said she had used “a range of analytical tools including AI-assisted literature searches, data synthesis, and document preparation” and were “entirely under my direction”.\nShe claimed the citation of Oreskes and Brulle was fair.\nShe claimed one of the papers in the Elsevier journal had become “inaccessible” and suggested this could be because “they contain findings that challenge dominant policy narratives”.\nReferring to the findings of nonexistent or long-closed organisations was “entirely appropriate”, she said, and the citation relating to Oakey windfarm was “misattributed” but was “intended to illustrate a real and serious issue”.\nShe said the claims from Friends of the Earth were “inflammatory, politically motivated, and does not reflect the reality of our work”.\nWhen the Guardian asked RRA if the responses to its questions had been generated using AI, Smith responded “Yes” in an email, and added it was “the most efficient way to review everything properly and provide you with an accurate and timely response. All of the information and conclusions are mine the tool simply helped me work through the material quickly.”",

    "body": "The weapons manufacturer Saab was “directly linked” to a human rights violation when a missile it produced was found in an Indigenous heritage area, an investigation for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has found.\nThe four-year investigation could lead to more companies being held accountable for how their weapons are used by clients, according to human rights lawyers involved in the case.\nThe 1.3-metre Saab RBS-70 anti-aircraft missile was discovered in January 2021 by traditional owners Andrew and Robert Starkey near Lake Hart, in remote South Australia. It was found in a section of the heritage site that overlaps with the defence force’s missile testing range near Woomera, which is one of the largest in the world. An exclusion zone for the range covers 122,000 sq km, roughly the size of England.\nThe location of the missile was also in close proximity to several culturally significant artefacts for the Kokatha people, including rock art.\nThe Starkey brothers told Defence about the missile in May 2021. When it had not been removed by September, they contacted Saab and lodged a complaint with the OECD, which can investigate whether multinational companies have breached human rights obligations.\nSaab immediately contacted Defence but the missile remained uncleared until January 2022 – a year after it was discovered. It may have been sold to Australia between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, the investigation suggested.\nThe complaint, investigated by the Australian National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (AusNCP), alleged that Saab did not undertake adequate due diligence that could have prevented its weapon being used in a human rights violation.\nIt also alleged that Saab failed to respect their right to protect and preserve the land.\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\nA final ruling by the AusNCP, published on Friday, found the brothers feared for their safety, with the missile preventing them from accessing their land and continuing their cultural practices.\n“This constituted an adverse impact on their human rights, including rights to enjoy culture and take part in cultural life, maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their traditional lands and to uphold their responsibilities to future generations,” the AusNCP said.\n“There are reasonable grounds to conclude that Saab did not cause or contribute to the adverse human rights impacts experienced by the notifiers.\n“However, as the ordnance as manufactured and supplied by Saab, the enterprise was directly linked to the adverse human rights impacts experienced by the notifiers.”\nA Saab spokesperson said the company was “committed to upholding human rights and complies with Australian laws, other nations export controls, and international treaties when supplying defence and security products to the Australian government”.\nThe AusNCP cannot issue sanctions or fines but called on Saab to update its human rights due diligence processes and meaningfully engage with First Nations people affected by the use of its weapons.\nAfter viewing a photo of the missile, Defence told the AusNCP it had verbally advised the brothers in July 2021 that it “posed no risk to their safety”, according to the report. But the investigators said in the report that the brothers had no recollection of this assurance.\nThe brothers referenced a November 2021 email from Defence, which warned that the missile could include unexploded ordnance and that it “must not be touched, removed or otherwise interfered with”.\nBut Defence told the AusNCP investigators that the missile did not contain an explosive element. It said this could be for several reasons, including that a warhead may not be used during testing, or the explosive material had detonated upon impact with aerial target.\nThe Starkey brothers’ lawyer, John Podgorelec, said it was “absurd that a Swedish missile could land in a protected heritage site in Australia and for Defence and Saab not know about it”.\nThe human rights lawyer said the ruling sent a message to arms companies that “unless you do your due diligence, customer misuse of your product can link you to human rights harms”.\nAndrew Starkey said the ruling “means we have some say in how overseas companies treat us and our country”.\nJohn Pace, a former secretary of the UN commission on human rights who worked with Podgorelec on the case, said Indigenous people had “a crucial role to play in building safe practices” in the area.\nThe AusNCP noted that Defence and the Starkey brothers were locked in a dispute about whether financial compensation has been provided.",

    "body": "Portugal’s parliament has approved a bill banning face veils worn for “gender or religious” reasons in public, in a move seen as targeting Muslim women who wear face coverings.\nThe measure was proposed by the far-right Chega party and would prohibit coverings such as burqas (a full-body garment that covers a woman from head to foot) and niqabs (the full-face Islamic veil with space around the eyes) from being worn in most public places. Face veils would still be allowed in airplanes, diplomatic premises and places of worship.\nThe bill stipulates fines for those wearing face veils in public ranging between 200 euros and 4,000 euros (£175 and £3,475).\nPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa still has to approve the bill. He could veto it or send it to the constitutional court for review.\nIf signed into law, Portugal would join a number of European countries such as Austria, France, Belgium and the Netherlands who have full or partial bans on face and head coverings.\nNot many women in Portugal wear such coverings, but the issue of Islamic veils has generated controversy similar to other European countries.\nChega cited France and other EU countries’ rationales for banning face coverings commonly worn by Muslim women. The party received support for the bill from center-right parties.\nIn its bill, Chega said that hiding the face subjects individuals – especially women – “to situations of exclusion and inferiority” and was incompatible with principles such as “liberty, equality and human dignity”.\nLawmakers from left-leaning parties disagreed.\n“This initiative is used solely to target foreigners, those who have a different faith,” said center-left Socialist party lawmaker Pedro Delgado Alves whose party voted against the bill.\nHe said that while no woman should be forced to wear a veil, the far-right party’s approach was wrong.",

    "body": "Donald Trump seemed more intent on brokering a peace deal than he was to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles during a White House meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that the US may need them for a future conflict.\nWhile Trump did not rule out providing the long-range missiles Zelenskyy seeks, Trump appeared cool to the prospect as he looked ahead to a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Hungary in the coming weeks.\nAfter speaking with Zelenskyy for more than two hours, Trump implored both Ukraine and Russia to “stop the war immediately”, even if it means Ukraine conceding territory.\n“You stop at the battle line, and both sides should go home, go to their families,” Trump told reporters on his way to his home in West Palm Beach, Florida. “Stop the killing. And that should be it. Stop right now at the battle line. I told that to President Zelenskyy. I told it to President Putin.”\nThe Ukrainian leader was frank, telling Trump that Ukraine has thousands of drones ready for an offensive against Russian targets, but needs American missiles.\n“We don’t have Tomahawks, that’s why we need Tomahawks,” he said.\nTrump responded: “We’d much rather have them not need Tomahawks.”\nLater, Trump reiterated that he wants the United States to hold on to its weaponry. “We want Tomahawks, also. We don’t want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country,” he said.\nTrump’s doubtful tone on the cruise missiles follows a surprise phone call with Vladimir Putin on Friday during which the Russian leader told Trump that supplying the Tomahawks would damage US-Russian relations.\nHis position on supplying Ukraine with weapons has changed a number of times since he returned to office in January, often after negotiations with Putin or European backers of Ukraine.\nDuring the White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also discussed plans to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Hungary, saying it was “to be determined” whether Zelenskyy would join but that he would inform him of the discussions.\n“There is a lot of bad blood,” Trump said.\nAfter the talks on Friday, the US president issued a stern call to both sides on social media to “stop the killing, and make a DEAL!”.\n“They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” Trump posted on Truth Social.\nZelenskyy told reporters he did not want to talk about long-range missiles, saying the US did not want escalation, and he was “realistic” about his chance of getting them.\nThe Ukrainian president, who spoke by phone with European leaders after the meeting, said he was counting on Trump to pressure Putin “to stop this war”.\nThe Kremlin’s top aide, Yuri Ushakov, earlier said Putin had initiated Thursday’s conversation with Trump, during which the Russian leader urged his US counterpart not to supply Ukraine with the Tomahawks.\n“I did actually say: ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him. I said it just that way,” Trump said, recounting the conversation.\n“He didn’t like the idea. You have to be a little bit lighthearted sometimes.”\nUshakov told reporters in Moscow that Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with Tomahawks “won’t change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries”.\nIt was the eighth known call between the two men since Trump began his second term in January, and followed a familiar pattern in the complex and often confusing contest between Putin and Zelenskyy for Trump’s ear.\nOn previous occasions, when Trump had seemed ready to tilt towards Kyiv and its European allies, a call from Putin was often followed by a sudden softening in the US leader’s tone towards Moscow.\nA flurry of activity was also set off with Trump’s announcement after the call that he was planning to meet the Russian president in the Hungarian capital on a date still to be determined, in an effort to end the war.\nPutin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Friday morning said that the summit could take place “within two weeks or later”.\nPeskov said Putin had already discussed the planned meeting with Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister. Orbán – an outlier among European leaders with warm ties to Trump and Putin – said he had also spoken to Trump about the summit, writing on X: “Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are under way.”\nIt remains unclear how Putin would travel to Hungary, given EU sanctions and airspace restrictions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the fact that he is wanted by the international criminal court (ICC). As a signatory to the ICC, Hungary would be obliged to arrest him, though Orbán has previously said this would not happen.\nWhen asked about the logistical challenges, Peskov said the route was “so far, of course, unclear”.\nHungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on Friday that Putin would be able to enter and leave the country. “There is no need for any kind of consultation with anyone, we are a sovereign country here. We will receive [Putin] with respect, host him and provide the conditions for him to negotiate with the American president,” he told a press briefing.\nTrump and Putin last met in Alaska in August, which did not produce a diplomatic breakthrough. Trump added that fresh high-level talks between Washington and Moscow would be held next week, led on the US side by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, before a presidential summit in Budapest.\nThe latest conversation, which lasted more than two and a half hours, appears to have sapped the momentum Zelenskyy had built with Trump, with the US leader now unlikely to show significant support for Ukraine before meeting Putin.\n“Zelenskyy must be pulling his hair out. Today’s meeting with Trump is now completely overshadowed and overtaken by the Budapest meeting,” said John Foreman, a former British defence attache to Moscow and Kyiv.\nTrump also has hinted that talks between Putin and Zelenskyy may need to take place indirectly, contradicting Zelenskyy’s longstanding aim of meeting Putin face to face to end the war.\n“They don’t get along too well, those two,” Trump said. “So we may do something where we’re separate. Separate but equal.”\nZelenskyy, who touched down in Washington on Thursday and met US defence contractors before his White House visit, has not commented on the Putin-Trump call, though few in Kyiv are likely to view it positively.\nSome Ukrainian officials tried to put a positive spin on the call, saying that Putin’s outreach underscored the Russian leader’s fear of new Ukrainian weapon supplies.\n“Today’s call between US President Donald Trump and Putin demonstrates how even the discussion about Tomahawk missiles had already forced Putin back into dialogue with America,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, wrote on X. “The conclusion is that we need to continue with strong steps. Strength can truly create momentum for peace.”.\nWhile Moscow has repeatedly claimed it is ready to end its invasion of Ukraine, Putin has shown no indication he is seeking compromise or to scale back his maximalist goal of forcing Kyiv’s capitulation.\nDespite Trump’s typically upbeat rhetoric that peace may be within reach, the US vice-president, JD Vance, struck a more cautious note on Thursday, saying that “the Russians and the Ukrainians are just not at the point where they can make a deal”, and that a settlement “remains possible but will require a lot more work”.\nIn an interview with the conservative network Newsmax, Vance spoke of what he called a “misalignment of expectations”, saying “the Russians tend to think they’re doing better on the battlefield than they actually are”.\nAdditional reporting by Jennifer Rankin",

    "body": "Three French governments have collapsed in less than a year, and the political crisis looks likely to continue, overshadowing Emmanuel Macron’s last 18 months in power and his domestic legacy.\nThis week, the latest minority government narrowly survived its first vote of no confidence. But it remains the weakest cabinet in decades and could be toppled at any moment if opposition parties join together to oust it. France faces a brutal two-month battle in parliament to achieve what once seemed the most basic element of governance: passing a budget.\nPolitical analysts argue that that the figure most damaged by the current crisis is the centrist president.\nThe pro-Europe, pro-business Macron was first elected in 2017, vowing to revolutionise politics and listen to voters like no one had done before. He promised a “pragmatic” cherrypicking of ideas from left and right to liberalise the economy, create jobs after decades of mass unemployment and end inequality. Crucially, he said he wanted to stop the rise of the far right by ensuring citizens had no more reason to vote for extremes.\nThere were crises: the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government revolt, followed by the Covid pandemic and then the war in Ukraine. And when he was re-elected in 2022, Macron no longer had an absolute majority in parliament.\nBut his woes deepened considerably when he gambled on calling a sudden and inconclusive snap parliamentary election in June 2024, at a time when Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (NR) was at a historic high after its European election win. Parliament is now split between three blocs: the left, the centre and the far right, which has increased its vote. No bloc has an absolute majority. Meanwhile, Macron’s centrist base has begun to fragment.\n“The crisis in France runs very deep,” said Rémi Lefebvre, a professor of political science at the University of Lille. “The problem is there are actually several crises mixed together. There’s a financial crisis of [public] debt, a social crisis of inequality, a weakness of political parties, and then there is the rise of the far right. Macron is not the sole cause of the crisis; it’s all those different factors, but Macron has accelerated those factors.”\nTo prevent the government being ousted this week, Macron and his centrist ally, the new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, appealed to the Socialist party. The government offered a highly symbolic suspension of the only major change of Macron’s second term: the 2023 pensions law that introduced a gradual rise in the retirement age from 62 to 64.\nLefebvre said Macron’s second term risked looking “chaotic” and ineffective. His choice not to appoint a leftwing government last year – when a left alliance won the greatest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority – had been seen as damaging democracy, he said.\nStewart Chau, the director of polling at Verian Group, said: “If there’s one political personality or political movement that emerges extremely weakened from the sequence which began with the snap election of July 2024, it’s Emmanuel Macron and his centrist party, Renaissance. That is clear in every study.”\nPolls this month have shown that only about 14-16% of voters have confidence in Macron. Even his global presence, which once boosted his image at home, no longer lifts his ratings. “His popularity has constantly declined in recent months, despite a significant international news cycle,” Chau said.\nSupport had dropped among Macron’s voters because he was seen as lacking empathy for people’s daily concerns, Chau said.\n“One of Macron’s biggest promises as president had been his vow to block the path of the far-right National Rally, saying that no one would ever have reason to vote for them again,” he added.\nBut since Macron became president, more people have voted for the RN and view the party as a credible alternative.\n“That is a real shift,” Chau said. “Previously, some people had voted for extremes, saying it was a protest vote. Today, a lot of French people think it’s no longer simply a protest vote, it’s an alternative – and Macron is, perhaps, responsible for that.”\nThe political historian, Jean Garrigues, said Macron’s image was now probably the worst of any president since France’s current political system, the Fifth Republic, began in 1958.\n“He has dropped to an exceptional level of unpopularity but, above all, an exceptional level of hatred,” Garrigues said. “[His Socialist predecessor] François Hollande also experienced record unpopularity but didn’t experience the same level of being detested as Emmanuel Macron.”\nGarrigues said this public rejection had roots that ran deeper than the current crisis. Macron arrived in 2017 amid strong hope and expectation built around a kind of mythology of the “man of the moment”, he said, but disappointment followed when voters felt his promises to work with all political sides and “permanently listen to citizens” were not materialising.",

    "body": "Giorgia Meloni has condemned the boss of Italy’s biggest trade union after he referred to the prime minister as the “courtesan” of Donald Trump.\nMaurizio Landini, the leader of CGIL, which organised several pro-Palestinian protests before the Gaza ceasefire deal, made the remarks on TV on Tuesday, the day after world leaders, including Meloni, met in Egypt for a Middle East peace summit.\nLandini accused Meloni of “not having lifted a finger” to bring peace in Gaza, limiting her role to “playing Trump’s courtesan”. “Fortunately, the Italian citizens took to the street to defend the dignity and honour of this country,” he said.\nIn a post on social media on Thursday, Meloni said Landini was “evidently clouded by a mounting resentment (which I can understand)”, before sharing a definition of “courtesan”.\n“I think everyone knows the most common meaning attributed to this word, but, for the benefit of those who might not, I’m publishing the first definition found through a quick internet search,” Meloni said, posting a screenshot that read: “Woman of easy virtue, heterosexual; euphemism, prostitute.”\nMeloni also criticised her leftwing opponents, saying that for decades they had “lectured us on respect for women” only to then criticise a woman by “calling her a prostitute”.\nIn response to the post, Landini argued there were “no sexist insults” towards Meloni and that he had used the term to imply “Trump’s lackey”.\nIn a statement, he said: “In a 10-minute interview, which anyone can easily rewatch, to avoid any misunderstanding or exploitation of the term used, I immediately clarified what I meant – that Meloni was on the coat tails of Trump, she was at Trump’s court, she was Trump’s lackey.”\nMeloni has long sought to nurture friendly relations with the US president. During a speech in Egypt, Trump turned to Meloni – the only woman at the event – and called her “beautiful”. “In the United States, it would be the end of your political career,” he said. “But I’ll take the risk. Do you mind if I say you’re beautiful? Because you truly are beautiful.”\nThe US president later praised her as “an inspiration to all” in reference to the English version of her book, I Am Giorgia: My Roots, My Principles, which has a foreword by his son Donald Trump Jr.\nIn August, Meloni also hit back after discovering that doctored photos of her and other prominent Italian women had been posted on a pornographic website, saying she was “disgusted” and expressing “solidarity and support to all the women who have been offended, insulted and violated”.",

    "body": "The Red Cross had handed over the body of another hostage from Gaza to the IDF, Israel said early on Saturday, amid a dispute over delays in the return of remains under the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel.\nThe Israeli military and security forces received the coffin from the Red Cross inside the Gaza Strip, and it was to be sent to the Ministry of Health’s National Center for Forensic Medicine in Israel. Israeli authorities said the family of the deceased would be notified first after a formal identification process.\nThe handover came after Hamas’ military wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, said the remains were that of an “occupation prisoner”, suggesting that they belonged to an Israeli rather than one of the hostages of several other nationalities also taken in Gaza.\nThis was the 10th deceased hostage Israel has received out of 28 bodies held in Gaza. Hamas, citing technical problems, has said it needed heavy machinery and excavating equipment to speed up the process of locating bodies buried under rubble.\nOn Friday, two bulldozers ploughed up the earth as Hamas searched for hostages’ remains in Hamad city, a complex of apartment towers in the city of Khan Younis. Israeli forces repeatedly bombarded the towers during the war, toppling some, and troops conducted a week-long raid there in March 2024.\nTurkey sent a team of specialists to help retrieve remains buried under the rubble, but the group was still waiting on Friday for Israeli permission to enter the territory. “It remains unclear when Israel will allow the Turkish team to enter Gaza,” a Turkish official told AFP, noting that the team’s mission included locating Palestinian and hostage remains. A Hamas source told AFP the Turkish delegation was expected to enter by Sunday.\nIsrael, insisting Hamas knows the whereabouts of the hostages’ bodies, has said the group was running out of time. Hamas has said it remains committed to the ceasefire agreement and to handing over the bodies of all remaining hostages.\nIsrael has returned to Gaza the bodies of 90 Palestinians for burial. Israel is expected to return more bodies, although officials have not said how many are in its custody or how many will be returned.\nThe dispute over hostage remains has cast a shadow over the ceasefire agreement – the first phase of US president Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war.\nAt a news conference in Ankara, Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said Israel’s statements about the hostage bodies were worrying. “Will Israel use Hamas’ incapability to locate bodies left under rubble … as an excuse and break the ceasefire? There is concern in the international community over this,” he said.\nEarlier on Friday, Hamas called on mediators to push for the next steps under the ceasefire, including reopening the border, letting in aid, beginning reconstruction, setting up an administration and completing Israel’s withdrawal.\nFighting has largely stopped in Gaza under Trump’s plan, endorsed by mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. However, Gaza’s Civil Defence Service said on Friday that 11 people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire on a vehicle south east of Gaza City, including seven children and three women.\nThe Israeli military did not comment on the incident, and Hamas again accused Israel of violating on the ceasefire.\nThe 20 living hostages who were taken by Hamas along with others during its assault on Israel on 7 October 2023 were returned from Gaza earlier this week.\nIsrael said on Thursday it was preparing for the reopening of Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt to allow Palestinians to move in and out, but gave no date as it traded blame with Hamas over violations of the ceasefire.\nOther unresolved elements of the plan include the disarmament of militants and Gaza’s future governance.\nWith Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "body": "Aid remains critically scarce in Gaza one week into the ceasefire, humanitarian agencies have warned, as Israel delays the entry of food convoys into the territory. The Israeli government and Hamas continue to trade blame over violations of the truce.\nThe UN World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday that it had brought about 560 tonnes of food a day on average into Gaza since the ceasefire began, but it was still below what was needed.\nIts spokesperson Abeer Etefa said: “We’re still below what we need, but we’re getting there ... The ceasefire has opened a narrow window of opportunity, and WFP is moving very quickly and swiftly to scale up food assistance.”\nAid trucks were lined up at the Kissufim crossing between Israel and Gaza since the early hours. It is one of the few entry points where lorries load supplies on the Israeli side before heading back into Gaza.\nAs aid entry was delayed into the strip, Israel continued to fire on Palestinians. The Israeli army shelled a car which had crossed past the ceasefire line with Israel in the Zeytoun neighbourhood of Gaza, killing nine people.\n“They had crossed the so-called ‘yellow line’, an imaginary boundary mentioned by the Israeli army. I am certain the family couldn’t distinguish between the yellow and red lines because there are no actual physical markers on the ground,” said Mahmoud Basal, the spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence.\nThe Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said on Friday that the yellow line in Gaza will soon be physically marked.\nDrivers often wait for hours for clearance to pass, with long delays leaving many stranded in the heat. Although 600 trucks are meant to enter Gaza each day, fewer than half that number make it through, and even that target falls short of the vast needs on the ground. Stringent restrictions on what can be transported means that some convoys are forced to turn back.\nDuring the war, Israel shut down entry and exit routes, largely blocking off food and medicine, which in turn caused a famine in parts of Gaza.\nThe UN said it would take time to reverse the famine in Gaza and urged the opening of all crossing points. Etefa said the WFP had five distribution points up and running but wanted to get to 145 in order to “flood Gaza with food”.\nThe WFP said it had not begun distribution in Gaza City, pointing to the continued closure of two border crossings, Zikim and Erez, to the north of Gaza where the humanitarian crisis is most acute.\n“Access to Gaza City and northern Gaza is extremely challenging,” Etefa said, adding that convoys of wheat flour and ready-to-eat food parcels were struggling to move along damaged or blocked roads from the south of the devastated territory.\nThough small amounts of nutrition products have reached the north, relief convoys were still unable to move significant quantities of food there, as well as other areas.\n“We’ve had 57 trucks yesterday [enter southern and central Gaza]. We consider this a breakthrough, but we’re not yet at the level of around 80-100 trucks a day,” Etefa said.\nThe ceasefire deal, signed last week, between Israel and Hamas raised hopes of a surge of humanitarian aid finally reaching the territory after two years of war, but most restrictions have remained in place, throttling the supply of desperately needed assistance.\nTens of thousands of tonnes of supplies are positioned in neighbouring countries such as Jordan and Egypt. Under the terms of the first phase of the deal, aid was meant to surge into the territory and humanitarian groups were preparing to bring large amounts of vital aid to starving people in Gaza this weekend.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that infectious diseases are “spiralling out of control”, with only 13 of the territory’s 36 hospitals even partially functioning.\n“Whether meningitis … diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, we’re talking about a mammoth amount of work,” Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for the UN health body, told Agence France-Presse in Cairo.\nIn a separate update, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory said on Thursday it had been scaling up deliveries of medical supplies to health facilities since the Gaza ceasefire came into effect.\nBut as Israel and Hamas continue to trade blame over breaches of the truce, there is a risk of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepening by the day.\nIsrael accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but has handed back only nine of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza.\nTurkey has deployed dozens of disaster relief specialists to help search for bodies under the rubble.\nGaza’s civil defence agency estimates that the bodies of about 10,000 people are trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given that there is an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory.\nThe US president, Donald Trump, has said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they’d do that,” Trump was quoted as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.",

    "body": "Throughout Israel’s two-year war in Gaza, aid officials working in the territory avoided naming Hamas in conversations they suspected might be intercepted, instead referring to the militant Islamist group as the “de facto authority”.\nThis careful euphemism for Hamas, which violently seized power in 2007, captured an important truth. Though the group was a less obvious presence in the last months of the conflict, in the absence of any alternative, it remained the closest the increasingly devastated territory had to a ruler.\nIts administrative officials continued to be key interlocutors for humanitarian organisations. Its armed police units hunted looters, armed gangs, clans who challenged its authority, the more outspoken critics among ordinary Palestinians and militia groups backed by Israel.\nThis campaign now appears to have become a priority for Hamas – and it requires weapons, which Hamas is supposed to relinquish if the current ceasefire deal reached last week is to harden into anything resembling a durable peace.\nFor Hamas, there are now new priorities, and they do not involve giving up guns. Senior officials have already made this clear, as have some involved in the tortuous negotiations under way on the second phase of Donald Trump’s 20-point “plan for peace”. Instead, the group has moved fast to assert its authority across the 47% of Gaza to which the population of 2.3 million hungry, weak and traumatised people are confined now that the Israeli military has withdrawn from its previous positions.\nIn recent days, there have been skirmishes, shootings and a public execution of seven unidentified “traitors and collaborators” in Zeitoun, a ruined neighbourhood to the east of Gaza City. Though the group may not be able to deter enemies, rivals and ordinary criminals through the certainty of punishment, it clearly believes it can do so through spectacular, terrifying armed violence.\nThis may appal onlookers, but not necessarily all of those whose lives have been blighted by the collapse in rule of law and social order in Gaza during the conflict.\nSome undoubtedly oppose the new rough justice. “You can’t correct one mistake with another,” an activist in central Gaza told the BBC. “Executions without fair trial are a crime. May God guide our people.”\nBut Najla Jundiya, from the central town of Deir al-Balah, said she supported the new Hamas campaign.\n“I won’t hide it … I am very worried about the chaos currently happening in Gaza and I strongly encourage the measures taken against thieves and those causing chaos until a responsible government takes over to maintain safety and security,” the 36-year-old told the Guardian.\nOne reason for the anarchy is that Israel refused to outline any alternative government to Hamas throughout the conflict and has blocked any role there for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises partial authority over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Despite Israeli efforts to promote armed gangs as a counterweight to Hamas on the ground, the result is a vacuum which Hamas can now fill.\n“When you have a complete and total destruction of a society, the ones who can maintain some sort of monopoly of violence will rule … Hamas has been by far the most successful in terms of deploying force and getting violence under control,” said H A Hellyer, an expert at London’s RUSI and the Center for American Progress in Washington.\nThe importance to Hamas of its current effort to eliminate rivals was underlined by comments made by Trump last week suggesting Hamas had been given a green light to use force to prevent “bad things” happening. This could only have come about if Qatar or another trusted interlocutor had passed on to the US a specific request from Hamas to be allowed to continue its crackdown. Almost simultaneously, however, Trump said: “If [Hamas] don’t disarm, we will disarm them. And it will happen quickly and perhaps violently.” He escalated that threat late on Thursday, saying: “If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.”\nTrump’s plan calls for the establishment of a transitional administration staffed by politically unaligned Palestinian technocrats under international oversight. It also specifies that Hamas and other armed factions in Gaza will be excluded from the future governance of Palestinian territories. There is no agreed timeline for any of this. In fact, there is no agreement at all.\nThe most likely scenario is that Hamas surrenders its minimal remaining stocks of heavier offensive weapons that could target Israel, but refuses to handover the kind of lighter arms that will allow it to crush any opposition to its rule. This falls short of what Trump – and Israel – demand, but may be sufficient.\nAs for the exclusion from future governance, these recent days are likely to prove decisive. Hamas may well give up any formal role in Gaza, but is very likely to remain the “de facto authority” for the foreseeable future.",

    "body": "Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations amid tensions over the flow of aid into Gaza and warnings that the humanitarian crisis in the devastated territory risks deteriorating further.\nThe ceasefire deal signed last week between Israel and Hamas raised hopes of a surge of humanitarian aid finally reaching the territory after two years of war, but most restrictions have remained in place, throttling the supply of desperately needed assistance.\nIsraeli officials said on Thursday that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would remain shut to individuals until Sunday at least – and may not open to humanitarian convoys at all. Aid agencies say opening Rafah, which has been controlled by Israel since May last year, is critical for bringing sufficient humanitarian assistance into the territory.\n“We need more fuel to go into Gaza, we need more food, more medical equipment, medications, medics, doctors,” said Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for the WHO, echoing demands by international leaders for Israel to allow in a massive increase of aid.\nIsrael accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire agreement by failing to return the remains of deceased hostages. On Monday, Hamas returned the last 20 surviving hostages but handed back only nine of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza.\nUS advisers working on the implementation of Donald Trump’s ceasefire deal, and the Red Cross, have said there are significant practical difficulties in recovering remains of hostages amid the devastation caused by Israel’s offensive during the past 24 months.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said on Thursday he was determined to ensure Hamas handed back the remains of hostages still in Gaza, adding that the fight “is not over yet”. Speaking at a state ceremony for soldiers killed in the two-year conflict, Netanyahu said Israel would achieve all its war aims and that its enemies had “learned that anyone who lifts a hand against it will pay a heavy price”.\nA senior Hamas official accused Israel of breaking the ceasefire by killing at least 24 people in shootings since Friday, and said a list of such incidents had been handed over to mediators. “The occupying state is working day and night to undermine the agreement through its violations on the ground,” he said.\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond but has previously said some Palestinians have ignored warnings not to approach Israeli ceasefire positions and that troops “opened fire to remove the threat”.\nRegional diplomats and US officials have sought to minimise the significance of the accusations, emphasising that Hamas and Israel still appear committed to the ceasefire. Trump’s 20-point plan includes “full aid” reaching Gaza, where a famine was declared in some areas in August, as well as the return of all the Israeli hostages, dead and alive.\nPope Leo XIV denounced the use of hunger as a weapon of war during an address to a UN agency on Thursday, but did not name any specific conflict or region. Aid workers in Gaza described Israel’s continuing restrictions on aid entering Gaza as “collective punishment”.\nBalkhy warned that infectious diseases were “spiralling out of control” in Gaza, with only 13 of the Palestinian territory’s 36 hospitals even partially functioning. “Whether meningitis … diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, we’re talking about a mammoth amount of work,” she said.\nA spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, suggested that Rafah would remain closed to aid in the future, although individual passage would be allowed. “It should be emphasised that humanitarian aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing. This was never agreed upon at any stage,” it said, adding that aid continues to enter the Gaza Strip through other crossings\nUN officials said on Thursday that the ongoing delays had allowed them to clear more aid with Israeli officials in preparation for when crossings reopen.\nStéphane Dujarric, a UN spokesperson, said a total of 200,000 metric tons of aid had been approved for entry into Gaza for when officials receive the green light to continue their work, and that the aid that was able to make it into the territory on Sunday, including more than a million nappies, was being quickly distributed to Palestinians by various UN agencies.\nRegional officials told the Guardian they expected the first days and weeks of the ceasefire to be “tense” and “scratchy”, with aid and the return of the remains of hostages among the key issues. Much of Trump’s plan, including many of the most difficult issues, has yet to be fully discussed by negotiating teams.\nOn Monday, Israel freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Israeli jails. This figure includes 1,700 Palestinians who were seized from Gaza during the war and held without charge.\nThe ceasefire deal also requires Israel to return the bodies of 360 Palestinians. The Gaza health ministry said it had received 30 more bodies of Palestinians on Thursday, bringing the total to 120 since last Friday. Doctors at Nasser hospital said the bodies showed signs of torture and execution, including blindfolds, cuffed hands and bullet wounds in the head, according to doctors’ accounts.\n“Almost all of them had been blindfolded, and had been bound up, and they had gunshots between the eyes. Almost all of them had been executed,” said Dr Ahmed al-Farra, the head of Nasser hospital’s paediatric department in Khan Younis.\nTrump has said he would consider allowing Israeli forces to resume fighting in Gaza if Hamas failed to uphold its end of the ceasefire deal. “Israel will return to those streets as soon as I say the word. If Israel could go in and knock the crap of them, they’d do that,” the US president was quoted on Wednesday as saying to CNN in a brief telephone call when asked what would happen if Hamas refused to disarm.\nIn Israel, there have been fierce debates over the fate of the hostages. Arbel Yehud, who was held in captivity for nearly 500 days before being freed under a previous deal in January, said on Wednesday that all the hostages could have returned home “a long time ago”.\nSpeaking at a press conference alongside families of newly freed hostages, including her partner, Ariel Cunio, who was released this week, Yehud said the deal brokered by Trump could have been struck earlier, in turn saving the lives of more hostages. “While we are here, fortunate to embrace our loved ones, there are dozens of families that never will,” said Yehud.",

    "body": "India has cast doubt on claims by Donald Trump that its prime minister, Narendra Modi, had agreed to stop buying Russian oil.\nOn Wednesday, Trump claimed that Modi had assured him “today” that India would put an end to its purchase of Russian oil.\n“I was not happy that India was buying oil, and he [Modi] has assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. You know, you can’t do it immediately. It’s a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,” Trump told reporters, before claiming he would soon convince China of the same thing.\nHowever, in a press briefing on Thursday Indian officials appeared to undermine the US president’s account, stating that there was “no telephonic conversation between PM Modi and US President Trump yesterday”.\nIndia, which maintains a strong relationship with the Kremlin, has become one of the biggest purchasers of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine.\nIt has been a significant source of contention with Washington in recent months since Trump failed to secure a peace deal with Russia. In August, the US president imposed some of his highest tariffs on India to penalise its purchase of Russian oil as he accused Delhi of helping to finance Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. India is subject to additional 25% import tariffs, on top of a base of 25%.\nIndia has publicly stood firm, claiming it would not let the US dictate its energy needs or interfere in its relationship with Russia, which dates back to the cold war. Russia remains the largest supplier of arms to India.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Indian government said discussions with the US over trade and tariffs were ongoing. A statement by the Indian ministry of external affairs said the priority was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario” and that all policies were dictated by the imperative to diversify and secure India’s energy sources.\nIndia has reaped significant benefit from its purchase of cut-price Russian oil since the Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, becoming one of its top purchasers globally, second only to China.\nHowever, it has led to a severe deterioration in US-India relations. The White House has increasingly sought to accuse Delhi of bankrolling the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s actions against Ukraine, describing the conflict as “Modi’s war”.\nHowever, on Wednesday the US president spoke glowingly of Modi. “Modi is a great man. He loves Trump,” he said.",

    "body": "Kanchha Sherpa, the last surviving member of the mountaineering expedition team that first conquered Mount Everest, has died at the age of 92, according to the Nepal Mountaineering Association.\nKanchha died early on Thursday at his home in Kapan, Kathmandu district, said Phur Gelje Sherpa, the association’s president.\n“He passed away peacefully at his residence,” Phur Gelje said, explaining that Kanchha had been unwell for some time. “A chapter of the mountaineering history has vanished with him,” he added.\nKanchha was among the 35 members of the team that put the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay atop the 8,849-metre (29,032ft) peak on 29 May 1953. He was one of three Sherpas to reach the final camp before the summit with Hillary and Tenzing.\nKanchha never climbed to the summit of Everest himself as his wife considered it too risky, he said in an interview in March 2024. He also forbade his children from becoming mountaineers.\nHe was well liked and widely respected in the climbing community, said Ang Tshering Sherpa of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, adding that Kanchha “was full of energy and even after retiring and in his old age, he was trekking to monasteries all over the Everest region for religious ceremonies”.\nTenzing died in 1986; Hillary died in 2008.\nKanchha was born in 1933 in the village of Namche in the Everest foothills, when most members of Nepal’s Sherpa community earned a living by farming potatoes and herding yaks.\nHe spent his childhood and young adult years trading potatoes in neighbouring Tibet. When he and several friends later visited Darjeeling, India, he was persuaded to train for mountain climbing and began working with foreign trekkers.\nKanchha began mountaineering when he was 19 and remained active in the expedition sector until the age of 50.\nIn 1953, his father’s friendship with Norgay helped Kanchha secure a job as a high-altitude porter for Tenzing and Hillary when they made the world’s first summit of Everest.\nHe was one of three Sherpas who reached the last camp below the summit, above the 7,900-metre South Col, and heard of the successful ascent on the radio. The three Sherpas were reunited with Tenzing and Hillary back at Camp 2 at about 6,400 metres.\n“We all gathered at Camp 2 but there was no alcohol so we celebrated with tea and snacks,” he said. “We then collected whatever we could and carried it to base camp.”\nKanchha made other Everest climbs over the years, reaching various altitudes.\nIn an interview with the Associated Press in March 2024, he expressed concerns about overcrowding and filth at the world’s highest peak. He urged people to respect the mountain, revered as the mother goddess Qomolangma among the Sherpas. Members of the community generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak.\n“It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,” he said. “Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas. But people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.”\nKanchha is survived by his wife, four sons, two daughters and grandchildren.",

Due to his employment with the state department and the Pentagon, Tellis had a top secret security clearance.\nTellis is alleged to have entered the US state department and a defence department facility and to have “printed on government computers, or asked a colleague to print, classified documents on topics including US military aircraft capabilities”.\nThe FBI has also accused Tellis of meeting Chinese officials on multiple occasions over the years and handing over documents in an envelope.\nTellis has denied the charges. In a statement, his lawyers said: “Ashley J Tellis is a widely respected scholar and senior policy adviser. We will be vigorously contesting the allegations brought against him, specifically any insinuation of his operating on behalf of a foreign adversary.”\nTellis had served in the US foreign service and is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington thinktank, where he had become a well-known strategic expert on US-India relations.\nIn India, where Tellis was born and was a regular commentator on foreign policy, news of his arrest ignited a political storm. “The forces working against India are beginning to unravel in ways few could have imagined,” said Amit Malviya, the head of the IT cell – a digital and social media arm – of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who had objected to Tellis’s critical writings on some BJP policies.\nTrump administration officials, including the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, have vowed to prosecute individuals who mishandle classified information.\nLindsey Halligan, the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, said the charges “as alleged in this case represent a grave risk to the safety and security of our citizens”.\nA state department official confirmed that Tellis was arrested on Saturday, but declined to comment further.

    "body": "Dozens of soldiers and civilians have been killed after fresh clashes broke out along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and Islamabad carried out retaliatory airstrikes on the Afghan capital, Kabul, and Kandahar province.\nThe two sides declared a ceasefire by Wednesday night after the latest outbreak of violence, which came after the deadliest cross-border clashes in years over the weekend.\nBoth countries accused the other of sparking the violence. Pakistan’s military said the Afghan Taliban had carried out “unprovoked fire” on major border posts close to the Kurram district and the crossing between the Chaman and Spin Boldak districts on Tuesday evening. It said it had retaliated with mortar fire and drone strikes, killing 20 Taliban fighters.\nPakistani security sources confirmed that the air force had also carried out strikes on headquarters of Taliban forces in Kandahar province, where the cross-firing reportedly began, and on targets in Kabul.\nImages showed the “friendship gate” at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing had sustained significant damage in the attacks, and it remained closed for the day. Hundreds of people fled Pakistani border villages overnight and local residents reported cross-border firing, strikes and drone deployment that lasted into the evening. In Kandahar province, residents said many people along the border areas had also been fleeing.\nThe Afghan Taliban claimed Pakistan had “once again” launched the attacks, killing more than a dozen civilians, and they said they had killed several Pakistani soldiers and seized several border posts. Pakistan rebuffed the claim as “outrageous and blatant lies”.\nThe heaviest casualties on Pakistan’s side were reported around the city of Chaman, which is just a few miles from the border and bore the brunt of heavy shelling from the Afghan side.\nNaqeeb Ullah, a resident in Chaman living just over a mile from the border, said the sky had been lit up with shelling and gunfire until the morning. “The sounds were so loud that it felt like it was happening in front of our house; all our doors and windows were shaking from the impact,” he said.\nUllah said heavy firing had destroyed a local school close to the border and that he knew of several civilian fatalities. “I know a family of two or three people who were killed in attacks and a 11-year-old was badly injured in the attack,” he said.\nThe resumption of the deadly clashes and airstrikes has pushed the two once-amicable neighbours the closest to conflict with each other in years and has sparked fears of wider regional instability.\nPakistan has maintained a longstanding relationship with the Afghan Taliban, sheltering many of the Islamist militant group’s leaders after the US invasion of Afghanistan. Pakistan was among those backing the Taliban when they retook power in 2021.\nHowever, ties between the two have severely deteriorated as Islamabad has accused Kabul of giving sanctuary to the Pakistan Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP has been behind a rising number of deadly attacks in Pakistan in recent years. Pakistan has accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering TTP leadership and ignoring TTP training camps in Afghanistan, as well as giving finance and arms to the group, a claim Kabul denies.\nLast week, Pakistan was accused of carrying out two strikes on Afghan soil, including in Kabul, which were believed to be targeting TTP camps and leadership. Pakistan has neither denied or confirmed it was behind the strikes.\nIn response, Taliban forces retaliated over the weekend with extensive firing at Pakistani troops stationed at border posts, prompting a heavy-handed response from Pakistan. Dozens of casualties were reported on both sides.\nThe violence flared up again on Tuesday night, starting in Kurram district, when the Afghan Taliban were accused of cross-border shelling.\nJaved Ali, a nearby resident, said: “The firings and border clashes erupted at 8pm and kept ongoing from both sides for around two to three hours. We stayed inside our houses as it was terrifying.”\nDawood Achakzai, a Chaman resident, said he had been woken at 3am by the sounds of heaving shelling and mortar fire. “The firing and shelling shook the city, people here have been terrified,” he said.\nHe said those living in villages close to the border had evacuated. “Villages on the Pakistani side were hit by mortar shells and heavy firing. Hundreds of families have left the villages. We are trying to help people to vacate and shift to safer places,” he said. “Since the 2021 Taliban captured power, we have not witnessed such heavy border clashes.”\nBy Wednesday night, both sides had agreed to a temporary 48-hour ceasefire, effective from 6pm. A statement by the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said both sides would engage in dialogue to find “a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue”.",

    "body": "It is often difficult for people in India to remember life before Aadhaar. The digital biometric ID, allegedly available for every Indian citizen, was only introduced 15 years ago but its presence in daily life is ubiquitous.\nIndians now need an Aadhaar number to buy a house, get a job, open a bank account, pay their tax, receive benefits, buy a car, get a sim card, book priority train tickets and admit children into school. Babies can be given Aadhaar numbers almost immediately after they are born. While it is not mandatory, not having Aadhaar de facto means the state does not recognise you exist, digital rights activists say.\nFor Umesh Patel, 47, a textile business owner in the city of Ahmedabad, Aadhaar has brought nothing but relief. He recalls the old days of bringing reams of paper to every official office, just to prove his ID – and confusion often still reigned. Now he simply flashes his Aadhaar and “everything is streamlined”, he said, describing it as a “marker of how our country is using technology for the benefit of its citizens”.\n“It’s a robust system that has made life much easier,” said Patel. “It is also good for the security of our country since it reduces the chances of anyone making fake documents.\n“Aadhaar is now part of the Indian identity.”\nThe scheme has been deemed such a success that it was among those studied by the UK government as it looks to introduce mandatory ID cards for all citizens. Yet digital rights groups, activists and humanitarian groups paint a less rosy picture of Aadhaar and its implications for Indian society.\nFor some of the poorest and least educated in India – whose lack of literacy, education or documents have left them unable to get an Aadhaar – the scheme has been highly exclusionary and therefore punitive, depriving some of those who need it most from being able to receive welfare or work. And as there is a growing push to have Aadhaar linked to voting rights and proof of citizenship, there are fears it will become a tool to further disenfranchise and demonise the poor.\nApar Gupta, the founder and director of the Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation, said that, for many in India, Aadhaar had turned into a form of “digital coercion, in which each and every time they need to avail a government service, enter a public space or just conduct their lives, there is a constant demand for Aadhaar-based authentication”.\nGupta said that since its introduction Aadhaar had “metastasised” and become the basis of an ever-expanding bureaucratic minefield of unique IDs required in order for people to conduct business. “Your very basis to live is checked at each and every step,” he said.\nCritics allege that India’s most recent data protection and privacy law, which remains in draft form, is not fit for purpose in protecting the privacy and possible misuse of the highly valuable and sensitive Aadhaar database, which includes biometrics such as photos, face scans, iris scans and fingerprints of more than 1 billion Indians.\nOver the years, the Indian media have uncovered numerous breaches of Aadhaar data, including an incident in 2018 when it was discovered that the details of 1.1 billion Indians on the Aadhaar database were being sold online for as little as 500 rupees (£5).\n“Under this law, which has still yet to be notified, there is no way to know if there has been a reported data breach and no oversight into how Aadhaar data may be bundled with other databases, which could enrich wider tracking and surveillance of citizens,” said Gupta. “There’s a complete lack of transparency.”\nWhile Aadhaar was introduced before the prime minister, Narendra Modi, came to power in 2014, his ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has embraced and expanded the unique digital ID scheme with gusto. As India hosted the G20 summit in 2023, Modi cited Aadhaar as one of the key successes of a “digital India” that had become an “incubator of innovation”. He has claimed that it has saved India more than $22bn in wiping out corruption in welfare schemes.\nThe government has also pointed to Aadhaar’s vast adoption as a measure of its success and universality. More than 1.42bn Aadhaar numbers have been generated as of last month – almost the exact size of the population of India itself – making it the world’s largest digital identity scheme by a long mile. Before the scheme, more than 400 million Indians lacked any form of official ID and did not have access to a bank account.\nYet, according to Chakradhar Buddha, a senior researcher at LibTech India, an organisation that has been assisting those left behind by India’s digital push, the reality on the ground – particularly in rural and tribal communities – was very different to that being painted by the government in Delhi.\n“We have seen those in tribal, hilly or remote areas being unable to get an Aadhaar – and it’s happening on a large scale that goes unacknowledged,” said Buddha.\n“Partly it’s because they might not have the right documents or their different documents don’t catch completely; partly it’s because the technology keeps changing and creating additional hurdles that punish the most vulnerable. Ultimately, it’s a system that undermines access to essential social security and welfare for those that need it most.”\nThe government’s insistence that Aadhaar is a watertight identity verification was questioned by Buddha, who said he had seen many examples of officials recording inaccurate names or details, creating greater problems for communities. In one village, where a tribal community did not have birth certificates, they were all given 1 January as their birthday. Tribal names are also regularly spelt wrong on Aadhaar cards as officials are unfamiliar with them.\nBuddha warned that using Aadhaar as a universal basis for voting rights would lead to a “mass expulsion of the poorest from the electoral register”, citing a recent example where millions of India’s poorest workers were wrongly deleted from a government system, depriving them of a livelihood, after an Aadhaar verification system was enforced.\n“These people are already deprived of social equality; now they want to use Aadhaar to strip away their right to political equality and universal franchise,” said Buddha.\nAmong those who recently came up against the perils of being without an Aadhaar card was Aalam Sheikh, 34, an illiterate labourer, whose bag containing important ID documents and Aadhaar card was stolen on a train.\nWhat followed was a Kafkaesque nightmare. Not knowing his Aadhaar number, which he was given a decade ago, he had no way to get a new card. Without it, he was stopped from working his construction job, depriving his family of a vital income, and his son was later forced to withdraw from school.\nMonths later, Sheikh has still been unable to resolve the problem and get a new card, even after travelling thousands of miles back to his village. Meanwhile, he lives in fear of being declared an illegal citizen without it.\n“This Aadhaar has become a nightmare for us. Why can’t the government maintain a proper system?” said Sheikh. “Everything in this country works against the poor, and so does this Aadhaar card.”\nAakash Hassan contributed reporting",

    "body": "Prince Andrew has agreed to give up his use of the Duke of York title, he said in a statement released through Buckingham Palace.\nHe will also give up use of his honours as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, meaning his only remaining title will be that of prince, which cannot be removed as he was born the son of a queen.\nIn a statement he said: “In discussion with the king, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family. I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\n“With His Majesty’s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.”\nTechnically, Andrew will retain the dukedom, which can only be removed by an act of parliament, but he will not use it. The title, in effect, remains extant but inactive, like the HRH (His Royal Highness) honorific.\nIt is understood the decision was taken in close consultation with his brother, King Charles, and in recognition of the fact that his personal issues continued to be an unwelcome distraction from the work of the wider royal family.\nThe king is understood to be glad of the outcome. The Prince of Wales was also consulted, along with other family members.\nAndrew’s ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, will also not use her title and be known simply as Sarah Ferguson. The titles of their two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will remain unaffected.\nThe agreement was made after high-level meetings at Buckingham Palace as aides were said to have finally reached a “tipping point”.\nThere was understood to be “concern” and “anxiety” within the royal household about the continual headlines causing serious reputational risk to the monarchy.\nAllegations about Andrew concern his relationship with the late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and recent details of his relationship with a prominent figure involved in the China spying case.\nThis week the Guardian published extracts from the posthumous memoir of Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, aged 41. In the book she claimed the prince “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”. Andrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre when she was 17, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.\nIn her book, due to be published on Tuesday, Giuffre describes meetings with Andrew. In one passage, she recounts what she said happened in London one evening.\n“Back at the house, [Ghislaine] Maxwell and Epstein said goodnight and headed upstairs, signalling it was time that I take care of the prince. In the years since, I’ve thought a lot about how he behaved. He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.\n“He seemed in a rush to have intercourse. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.\n“The next morning, Maxwell told me: ‘You did well. The prince had fun.’ Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called ‘Randy Andy’.”\nLate on Friday Giuffre’s family said the decision about Andrew’s titles was “vindication for Virginia”.\n“We, the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, believe that Prince Andrew’s decision to give up his titles is vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere,” they said in a statement.\nThey added: “Further, we believe it is appropriate for King Charles to remove the title of Prince.”\nIt has also been reported that Andrew held meetings in 2018 and 2019 with Cai Qi, a member of China’s ruling politburo. Cai was suspected of being the recipient of sensitive information allegedly passed to China by two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing.\nThe case against Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash was recently dropped by the CPS and both have denied wrongdoing.\nAndrew has already been stripped of his military titles and charity affiliations and banned from using his HRH honorific.\nAs well as the dukedom, he will also now no longer use the other titles given to him on his wedding day – the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh.\nThe Labour MP for York Central, Rachael Maskell, called for a law change in light of the Andrew news.\nA bill already proposed by Maskell would provide the king with the power to remove titles on his own initiative or after the recommendation of a joint parliament committee.\nMaskell said on Friday night: “Having sought to change the law through my removal of titles bill, I now think it is time for this legislation.”\nEmails recently published by the Mail on Sunday also appeared to show Andrew had been in contact with Epstein later than he had claimed in his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis.\nIn 2019, Andrew told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that he broke off his friendship with Epstein in December 2010, after the two men were photographed together strolling in New York.\nBut he wrote to Epstein in the message after the photo was published: “I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”\nHe is said to have signed off with: “A, HRH The Duke of York, KG.”\nEpstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.\nIn 2008 he pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, for which he served time in jail.\nAlso late on Friday, documents were released in the US showing Prince Andrew took flights on Epstein’s private jet on four occasions.\nThe prince is listed on flight logs as having flown from Luton to Edinburgh on 1 September 2006, with the convicted sex trafficker Maxwell, as well as a flight from 12 May 2000, where he is named as travelling with Epstein, Maxwell, the celebrity chef Adam Perry Lang, a bodyguard and three others.\nTwo further flights from 1999 also displayed the name “Prince Andrew”, alongside the royal protection officer Steve Burgess.\nThe wife of the disgraced former New Jersey senator Bob Menendez, Gwendolyn Beck and a woman named Claire Hazel are also listed on one of the 1999 flights – with Epstein and Maxwell travelling on both.\nThe flight logs surfaced after the US House oversight committee published hundreds of further documents from Epstein’s estate on Friday.",

    "body": "This is the outcome that, ultimately, King Charles and the Prince of Wales would have hoped for: Andrew, the subject of so many toxic headlines unhelpful to the royal family and institution of monarchy, finally doing the “honourable” thing.\nIt has been six long years since his disastrous Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis precipitated the start of this very public fall from grace.\nIts immediate aftermath saw him step back from public duties “for the foreseeable future”. His HRH style was put in abeyance, and he was stripped of all his military and charity patronages.\nThe humiliation, then, will have been hard for a man who so clearly cherishes his status. Now it is complete.\nHe has always clung stubbornly to his dukedom, a gift from his mother on the morning of his wedding in 1986, along with the titles the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. And to his prestigious Garter role as Royal Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter. He will no longer use any of them, with immediate effect.\nAnd he has always, including in Friday’s statement agreeing to put them in abeyance, vehemently denied the allegations against him. He maintains he did not have sex with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein who died in April by suicide aged 41, and whom he claimed he had never met yet paid millions to in order to settle a civil sexual assault case.\nThe headlines will not go away. With each one, the risk of reputational damage to the monarchy is graver. Behind the walls of Buckingham Palace, it has been decided, enough is enough.\nAndrew’s acceptance of his fate comes on the eve of the posthumous publication of Giuffre’s memoir, due out next week, exclusive extracts from which have been published by the Guardian this week. More unwelcome coverage was, perhaps, inevitable. Certainly palace aides would have feared so.\nCharles is due to make a historic visit to the Holy See next week, when he will become the first English monarch since Henry VIII split with Rome in 1534 to pray publicly with the pope and head of the Catholic church. The king will not have wanted coverage of that occasion to be overshadowed by yet more vocal cries for Andrew to relinquish his titles.\nPressure has clearly been ramped up by other senior royals on the eighth in line to the throne.\nIt was a bad week in which Andrew found himself linked to the collapsed China spy case when it emerged he had held meetings with Cai Qi, the member of China’s politburo at the centre of the spy scandal. They had met on at least three occasions between 2018 and 2019, and the prince had invited him to Buckingham Palace for lunch in 2018.\nThe week had begun with leaked emails allegedly showing that far from cutting off contact with Epstein in December 2010, as he had claimed in his 2019 Newsnight interview with Maitlis, he was apparently in touch with the disgraced US financier in February 2011.\nThe emails purported to show Andrew messaging Epstein on publication of that famous photograph of the prince with his arm around Giuffre, saying that they were “in this together”.\nFriday’s statement presents this as Andrew’s decision, yet it would certainly have been made by the palace. Charles will not have relished taking the drastic step of forcibly removing the dukedom. The last time a dukedom was taken away from a senior royal was more than 100 years ago, according to the historian Anthony Seldon, who told the BBC: “That was in 1919, when Prince Charles Edward – one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons – lost the title of Duke of Albany for fighting on the German side during World War One.”\nIt would also have required an act of parliament.\nAndrew is also a brother: a brother Charles has hitherto loyally included in family occasions, though Andrew will not be present at the royal family’s Christmas celebrations this year.\nThe prince’s continued obduracy over doing the “honourable” thing will have saddened and frustrated the king, who seems to have finally grasped the nettle and found a way to persuade his sibling this is in the family and the monarchy’s best interests.\nSo what is left for the son of the late Queen Elizabeth? He remains a prince and eighth in the line of succession. He is also still theoretically a counsellor of state – a stand-in for the king if he’s overseas or unwell. It is only theoretical, because as a non-working royal the palace has already made clear he would never be asked. As with many of his titles, it’s classed as “inactive”.\nBut all the other vestiges of his once senior royal role are now no more.",

    "published": "2025-10-18T02:02:57.147387",
    "body": "Rachel Reeves has said she “can’t leave welfare untouched” this parliament, with the Treasury understood to be considering axing up to £1bn in tax breaks for a scheme providing cars for disabled people.\nThe chancellor set out her thinking on welfare before next month’s budget in an interview, having previously said she would need to make cuts and raise taxes.\n“We can’t leave welfare untouched,” she told Channel 4 News when asked about changes to the benefit system. “We can’t get to the end of this parliamentary session and I’ve basically done nothing … We have to do reform in the right way and take people with us.”\nThe government had to abandon billions of pounds in cuts to disability benefits earlier this year after a revolt by Labour backbenchers, but it is still pressing ahead with cuts for future claimants of the health element of universal credit from April 2026.\nIt is now understood to be considering removing tax breaks for the Motability scheme, under which disabled people are exempt from VAT and insurance premium tax on cars subsidised by the government.\nWhitehall sources said the ending of tax exemptions was under consideration but that no decision had been taken. They downplayed the idea of reducing the eligibility criteria for Motability cars, but said the option of scrapping the VAT and insurance premium tax exemptions was “more likely”.\nAnother change under consideration is the idea of removing luxury brands such as BMW and Mercedes from the scheme, under which a minority of claimants top up with an advance to get a more premium car. These premium brands only make up 40,000, or about 5%, of the 800,000 Motability cars.\nAdding VAT and insurance premium tax to the Motability car’s price tag would mean more claimants would need to make an advance payment for their cars. Estimates suggest it could bring in about £1.2bn, although Whitehall sources suggested it would not be likely to raise as much as that.\nAlthough not a direct cut to the benefits bill, further attempts to reduce tax exemptions for the Motability scheme would still be controversial, with critics warning the Treasury to listen to the concerns of disabled people.\nJames Taylor, the director of strategy at the charity Scope, said it could “heap extra costs on to disabled people all over Britain”. “Motability is a cost-effective way for disabled people to be able to use adapted cars. Often these cars need to be able to accommodate equipment, carers, and disability related aids,” he said.\n“Life costs more if you are disabled. Energy and day-to-day living costs remain stubbornly high across the board. The government shouldn’t be looking to ramp up costs on disabled people. They could leave more disabled people isolated, and less able to get into work.”\nEmma Vogelmann, the co-chief executive of the disability group Transport for All, said: “As disabled people we often find public transport is unusable – broken pavements, nonexistent bus routes, and packed stations we can’t navigate. A Motability car changes that – it allows us to work, shop, and do the school run. Scaling back the scheme would lock disabled people away from daily life. Does the chancellor want to take away our freedom?”\nCuts to the Motability scheme have previously been backed by the Conservatives. Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said on Friday that the chancellor was “following our lead”.\n“I’m glad she’s been keeping an eye on our welfare announcements, but the government should be doing much more to fix welfare and reform the Motability scheme,” she said.\n“Motability should be there for people with serious disabilities. That’s why the Conservatives would stop people with low-level mental health problems and neurodiversity – like mild depression and ADHD – getting free cars. We would also put an end to taxpayers funding luxury cars on Motability, instead ensuring every penny goes towards supporting genuinely disabled people.”\nRather than giving people “free cars”, the Motability scheme allows disabled people to use their personal independence payment (Pip) to lease new cars for three years. The scheme is run by a private company, overseen by a charitable foundation, that buys new cars then leases them to claimants for three years before selling them on.\nRachael Maskell, a Labour MP who was one of the strongest critics of the government’s abandoned disability cuts, said the “government must adopt a process of co-production [involving disabled people] and then follow the evidence … Random top-slicing or cuts often cost more in the long run”.\nA Treasury spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation around changes to tax outside of fiscal events.”\nWhile Labour’s attempts to cut disability benefits were largely abandoned earlier this year, government sources suggested the chancellor continues to believe the system is unsustainable in its current form and in some cases disincentivises people from seeking work.\nReeves is expected to introduce a significant package of tax increases and spending cuts in her 26 November budget to offset a downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts for economic growth.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said on Thursday that the chancellor could be forced to look again at welfare savings alongside tax rises. The IFS said options could include scrapping the pensions triple lock, a fresh drive to cut health-related and disability benefits, and limiting growth in spending on special educational needs.\nThe OBR reviewed its forecasting model over the summer and is expected to say the public finances look £10-20bn weaker than it believed at the time of Reeves’s spring statement. The chancellor has expressed irritation at the timing of this review, which she believes would have been better done immediately after last year’s general election or in 2023.\nAs well as tackling this deterioration, the chancellor must also deal with the £7bn cost of the U-turns on winter fuel and welfare. Reeves is hoping to build up more “headroom” against her fiscal rules, to avoid being buffeted by the bond markets.\nGovernment borrowing costs fell to their lowest level since July on Friday after Reeves’s comments on tax and spend appeared to reassure investors.",

    "body": "Tensions between Britain and China have escalated after Beijing criticised further delays to a planning decision on its proposed “mega embassy” in London.\nChina’s ministry of foreign affairs expressed “grave concern and strong dissatisfaction” after Steve Reed, the housing secretary, pushed back his final decision on the proposal until 10 December.\nThe row further complicates attempts by Keir Starmer, the prime minister, to reset relations with Beijing, which have already been damaged by a row over alleged Chinese espionage in the UK.\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, told a press conference in Beijing on Friday that the UK had shown “disregard for contractual spirit, acting in bad faith and without integrity”.\nHe said China had acted with “the utmost sincerity and patience” and the UK should “immediately fulfil its obligations and honour its commitments otherwise the British side shall bear all consequences”.\nThe prime minister’s spokesperson told reporters on Friday that the decision over the embassy was quasi-judicial and “independent of the rest of government”. He said he did not “recognise any claims of commitments or assurances”.\nConservative MPs have accused ministers of breaking the law by giving China private assurances that they would wave through the proposed complex, which at 20,000 sq metres would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.\nOliver Robbins, the head of the Foreign Office, is in China this week discussing the embassy application and the refurbishments Britain wants to carry out on its own embassy in Beijing. The Guardian revealed last year that China was refusing to let the works go ahead while the fate of its own embassy is being decided.\nStarmer has been keen to improve relations with Beijing as he seeks foreign investment to help build big infrastructure projects in the UK. But those attempts have faced multiple hurdles, including the two recent rows over spying and the proposed new embassy.\nBeijing bought the site of the prospective embassy near the Tower of London for £255m in 2018. Tower Hamlets council refused permission for the project in 2022, prompting wrangling over whether it could go ahead.\nChina resubmitted its application shortly after Labour came to power and Xi Jinping raised the matter directly with Starmer in their first call in August 2024.\nStarmer told Xi on the margins of the G20 summit in November 2024: “You raised the Chinese embassy building in London when we spoke on the telephone. We have since taken action by calling in that application.”\nAngela Rayner took over the decision last year in her role as housing secretary, but was replaced by Reed days before a decision deadline of 9 September. That deadline was pushed back until 21 October after China redacted large portions of its plans for what it said were security reasons.\nDowning Street this week said the decision had been delayed again in the midst of a separate controversy over two British citizens accused of spying for China. The case against the pair, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, collapsed last month, prompting accusations that the government had intervened in order to preserve diplomatic ties with Beijing.\nParliamentarians wrote to Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, Matthew Collins, his deputy who drafted the government’s evidence in the case, and Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, with a series of questions on Friday night.\nThe joint committee on the national security strategy (JCNSS) has launched an inquiry into the collapse of the case.\nThe JCNSS asked Powell and Collins whether there was anything unusual in the nature of their involvement in this case, and whether the government conducted an internal legal assessment into the evidence it would provide.\nIt asked Wormald whether he believed the Crown Prosecution Service acted correctly in this case and whether it would have been appropriate for it to seek additional evidence from other parts of government.\nMeanwhile, reports suggest Beijing has been accessing classified material on British servers for several years, renewing concerns that it could use the new embassy to bolster its surveillance efforts.\nMatt Western, the Labour MP who chairs the joint committee on national security wrote to the government on Monday to say that approving the embassy was “not in the UK’s long-term interest”.\nWestern said the proposed location posed “eavesdropping risks in peacetime and sabotage risks in a crisis” owing to its proximity to fibre-optic cables, datacentres and telecoms exchanges serving Canary Wharf and the City.\nDowning Street said the new delay to the embassy planning decision was not motivated by political concerns and instead reflected the complexity of the application.\nA spokesperson said on Thursday: “Given the detailed nature of the representations that have been provided, and the need to give parties sufficient opportunity to respond, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government considers that more time is needed for full consideration of the applications.”",

    "body": "King Charles is considering stripping Prince Andrew of his title of Duke of York after a string of allegations, the Guardian understands.\nBuckingham Palace has reportedly reached “a tipping point” over headlines about Andrew’s connections to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and to a senior Chinese Communist party official suspected to be at the heart of the recent collapsed China spy case.\nThe Guardian understands that the Prince of Wales is keen for his uncle to be stripped of his titles before he inherits the throne, and that the king recognises this is something he needs to do to smooth his son’s path.\nRemoval of Andrew’s dukedom would require an act of parliament, but with the king’s backing could receive government and public support, the Times reported on Friday.\n“It feels like we are reaching a tipping point,” a royal source told the newspaper, which claimed there was understood to be “concern” and “anxiety” within the royal household about serious reputational risk to the monarchy from the continual headlines.\nAnother option would be to banish Andrew from the Order of the Garter, which the Daily Mail reports the king is urgently and actively considering.\nIt follows the publication of extracts in the Guardian from the posthumous memoir of Andrew’s accuser Virginia Giuffre, who took her life in April aged 41. In her book, Giuffre claimed the prince behaved as if he “believed that having sex with me was his birthright”.\nAndrew has always denied claims he had sex with Giuffre, a victim of Epstein’s, and settled a civil case with her for a reported £12m with no admission of liability.\nIt has also been reported that Andrew held meetings in 2018 and 2019 with Cai Qi, a member of China’s ruling politburo. Cai was suspected of being the recipient of sensitive information allegedly passed to China by two British nationals accused of spying for Beijing. The case against Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash was recently dropped by the CPS and both have denied wrongdoing.\nEmails recently published by the Mail on Sunday also appeared to show Andrew had been in contact with Epstein later than he had claimed in his Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis.\nBuckingham Palace is said to have hoped Andrew might voluntarily give up his titles before being forced. Given that there are procedural difficulties with removal of his dukedom, it was hoped that he may act with “honour”, a source told the Times.\nIf not, it is understood that the king would be resolute in taking the difficult steps required to sanction his brother, the paper said.\nBuckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and the Duke of York’s representatives have been approached for comment. Kensington Palace has declined to comment.",

    "body": "The Trump administration on Friday asked the US supreme court to permit the deployment of national guard troops to Illinois, as the president pushes to expand the domestic use of the military in a growing number of Democratic-led cities.\nIn an emergency filing, the justice department urged the court to overturn a lower court ruling that halted the deployment of several hundred national guard troops to the Chicago area. The district judge had raised doubts about the administration’s justification for sending troops, questioning its explanation in light of local conditions.\nA federal appeals court upheld the lower court’s decision on Thursday, keeping the deployment on hold while the legal challenge proceeds.\nLate on Friday evening, US district judge Sara Ellis ordered federal officers to use body cameras. Ellis said those officers trained and equipped with body-worn cameras must turn them on while conducting immigration enforcement activity, including during interactions with the public.\nThe new measure follows her earlier temporary restraining order requiring federal immigration officers to give warnings before using anti-riot weapons like tear gas and to wear visible identification.\nEllis also said she wants representatives from federal immigration agencies to appear at a hearing on Monday to answer her questions about how her order – in effect until 6 November – is being implemented.\nD John Sauer, the solicitor general representing the administration, wrote in the new filing that federal agents have repeatedly been “threatened and assaulted” in Chicago and the suburb of Broadview, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility is located.\nTrump has already sent national guard units to Chicago and Portland, following earlier deployments to Los Angeles, Memphis, and Washington DC. The president has argued that military intervention is needed to curb unrest and bolster immigration enforcement.\nTrump and his supporters have portrayed these cities as dangerous and overwhelmed by violent demonstrations, framing the military’s role as essential to restoring order.\nDemocratic officials have pushed back sharply, saying the president’s claims are greatly exaggerated and politically motivated. They accuse Trump of misusing his authority to punish opponents.\nJudges have also voiced skepticism about the administration’s depiction of events. Local leaders say protests over immigration enforcement have been mostly small and peaceful, contradicting Trump’s characterization of “war zone” conditions.\nA recent report from the Guardian revealed that US military veterans increasingly face arrest and injury amid protests over Trump’s deportation campaign and his push to deploy national guard members to an increasing number of American cities.\nAt the center of the dispute is Trump’s use of a federal statute allowing the president to federalize the national guard only in cases of rebellion or when “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States”. The administration insists that the troops are necessary to protect federal property and officers from protesters.\nEarlier this month, the administration federalized 300 members of the Illinois national guard and ordered additional Texas national guard troops into the state.\nAs local leaders condemned the move, Trump escalated his rhetoric, calling on 8 October for the arrest of Chicago’s mayor and the Illinois governor, both Democrats, accusing them of failing to safeguard immigration officers.\nIllinois and Chicago jointly sued the administration to stop the deployment. On 9 October, district Judge April Perry, appointed by Joe Biden, issued a temporary injunction blocking the order.\nMeanwhile in Chicago, at least 11 people were taken into custody outside the Broadview Ice detention center following heated confrontations between Illinois state police and protesters.",

    "body": "Donald Trump announced on Friday he had commuted the sentence of George Santos, the disgraced former New York representative and serial fabulist who had been sentenced to more than seven years in prison after a short-lived political career marked by outlandish fabrications and fraudulent scheming.\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump called Santos “somewhat of a ‘rogue’” but expressed sympathy for the New York Republican. Santos was sentenced in April after pleading guilty last year to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\n“I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said in the lengthy post. “Good luck George, have a great life!”\nThe United States pardon attorney tweeted a photograph of the signed commutation shortly after Trump’s post, writing that he was “honored” to have “played a small role” Trump granting Santos clemency.\n“Thank you, Mr. President for making clemency great again,” he wrote.\nSantos reported to a federal prison in New Jersey in July and began serving an 87-month sentence for charges that ultimately led to his expulsion from Congress in 2023. Trump’s post suggested he was moved by a letter penned by Santos that was published in a local Long Island newspaper this week. Santos wrote about his life in solitary confinement and made direct plea to the president for a “chance to rebuild”.\nTrump issued the commutation after a push from key Republicans allies, most notably Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene, a prominent former House colleague of Santos, had called his conviction a “grave injustice” and urged intervention after the sentence was handed down. She also sent a letter in August asking the justice department for a commutation.\nAsked at the time whether he might consider clemency for Santos, Trump, who has a history of rewarding supporters with pardons, did not rule it out, but said he had not been asked.\n“He lied like hell,” Trump told Newsmax, adding: “But he was 100% for Trump.”\nOn Friday, Greene thanked the president for the commutation and said of Santos: “He was unfairly treated and put in solitary confinement, which is torture!!”\nElsewhere in his post on Friday, Trump compared Santos with the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. He made reference to the decades-old claims that Blumenthal “made up” aspects of his military record. Blumenthal admitted in 2010 that he misrepresented his military service after saying he had been “in” Vietnam. Blumenthal served as a Marine Corps reservist during the Vietnam War, but was not deployed in Vietnam.\nTrump, who never served in the military, has repeatedly attacked Blumenthal. His account of the senator’s past misstatements have even become increasingly exaggerated in recent years.\n“This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” Trump wrote of Blumenthal on Friday.\nBefore and after entering Congress, Santos lied prolifically about his biography. Despite making history as the first out LGBTQ+ Republican elected in Congress, his fabulist tendencies caught up with him with the release of a damning report from the House ethics committee. That report detailed how Santos used campaign funds for things like travel, cosmetic treatments and luxury goods and helped fuel his spectacular fall.\nBut Santos, who catapulted from relative anonymity to pop culture sensation almost overnight, shared Trump’s love of the national spotlight – even when trained on his misdeeds.\n“Well, darlings … The curtain falls, the spotlight dims, and the rhinestones are packed,” Santos wrote in a tweet pinned to the top of his X account. “From the halls of Congress to the chaos of cable news what a ride it’s been! Was it messy? Always. Glamorous? Occasionally. Honest? I tried … most days.”\nThe judge overseeing Santos’s case sided with federal prosecutors, who argued the former congressman had failed to show genuine remorse despite his legal team’s insistence to the contrary. That lack of contrition, they said, warranted a tougher sentence.\nSantos’s commutation marks the latest in a string of high-profile interventions by Trump, who has resumed the use of presidential clemency to reward political allies since returning to the White House in January.\nTrump, in May, issued a pardon to Michael Grimm, a former Republican congressman from New York who admitted to concealing income and wages related to a Manhattan restaurant he owned. Also pardoned was John Rowland, the former Connecticut governor whose political ascent collapsed under the weight of a federal corruption case and two prison terms.\nAt the same time, Trump has directed his justice department to bring criminal charges against his political enemies, including his former national security adviser turned prominent critic John Bolton, who was indicted this week and has pleaded not guilty.\nTrump last year became the first former American president to be convicted of felony crimes, stemming from a hush money case in New York that he continues to dismiss as a witch hunt.",

    "published": "2025-10-18T02:02:57.963057",
    "body": "Six months after approving the largest sexual abuse settlement in US history, officials in Los Angeles announced the county tentatively agreed to pay another huge sum, nearly $1bn, to settle more than 400 additional claims against county employees.\nIn April, Los Angeles county approved a historic $4bn settlement with about 11,000 claimants and allegations of sexual abuse in LA juvenile facilities that dated back decades. On Friday, the county said it had reached another major settlement for $828m, pending approval by the board of supervisors, the county governing body, and the county claims board.\n“Our settlements balance our obligation to compensate victims and treat their experiences with compassion, with the need to put strong protections in place to protect taxpayers from fraud,” Kathryn Barger, the chair of the Los Angeles county board of supervisors, said in a statement.\nThere are still 2,500 other unresolved cases, not covered by either settlement, that remain, and that number is expected increase, according to the county. The settlements have added to the county’s unprecedented financial problems, which mounted after the wildfires that ravaged the region earlier this year.\nCounty officials said in announcing the new settlement that “the credibility of every individual claim will be reviewed, and plaintiffs determined to have submitted fraudulent claims will receive no money from the settlement”.\nAuthorities are investigating allegations that some people were paid to file claims. Nine plaintiffs included in the first settlement said they were paid to file a lawsuit, and four of have said they made fraudulent claims, according to a Los Angeles Times investigation.\nThe lawsuits filed by thousands of people alleged they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities in the county with claims as far back as 1959. They were able to sue because of a California law that took effect in 2020 that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sex abuse victims, allowing them to bring cases for three years.\nThe county said its ability to assess the validity of allegations was hampered by a lack of records, the sheer number of cases and court ordered limits on legal discovery, officials said.\nUnder the $4bn settlement, the amount paid to each plaintiff could range from $100,000 to $3m. If the latest settlement is approved, individual awards will be determined based on factors including the severity of abuse alleged.\nIn its statement, the county said that claims brought by the law firm Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, in the April settlement will undergo additional scrutiny.\nSome of the plaintiffs represented by the firm told the LA Times that people they met outside a county social services office offered them money to submit claims, drove them to the DTLA firm and then paid them amounts ranging from $50 to $200 each. Non-attorneys are prohibited from soliciting people to sign up for lawsuits with a firm under California law.\nDTLA has denied any wrongdoing. Plaintiffs represented by the firm could be asked to do additional interviews and provide more proof of allegations, depending on the nature of the claim and the suspected fraud, the county said.\nThe county may also refer attorneys accused of paying for claims to the state bar for possible disciplinary action, officials said.\nDTLA Law Group said it filtered through nearly 13,000 inquiries and only accepted a fraction of the cases.\n“We do not pay our clients to file lawsuits, and we strongly oppose such actions. If we ever became aware that anyone associated with us, in any capacity, did such a thing, we would end our relationship with them immediately,” the firm said. “We want justice for real victims.”\nThe county has put into place more safeguards to prevent abuse and act quickly if it does occur, officials said. That includes a new hotline for reporting child sexual abuse allegations against county employees that is expected to be in place by year’s end.\nBut officials said the law allowing the lawsuits has placed severe financial stress on the county and required cuts to “critical” programs and services and that “common sense fixes that strike the right balance for victims and LA county and other public entities” are needed.\n“LA county and other local governments must balance their obligations to past victims with the need to avoid ruinous financial impacts that would undermine the very social safety net services that our young people, families and communities depend on today,” said Joe Nicchitta, the acting county chief executive.\nThe $4bn settlement in April far surpassed a $2.6bn settlement reached in 2022 with Boy Scouts of America the largest aggregate sexual abuse settlement in US history at the time.",

    "body": "Marc Benioff, the billionaire CEO of Salesforce and owner of Time magazine, apologized on Friday for saying he supported Donald Trump sending national guard troops to San Francisco.\nBenioff, who has been facing intensifying backlash in California, said in a post that after he “listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials … I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco”.\nHe said his earlier comments “came from an abundance of caution” around his company’s major annual conference called Dreamforce, which took place this week. “I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused. It’s my firm belief that our city makes the most progress when we all work together in a spirit of partnership.”\nThe executive of the cloud-based software firm had expressed support for the federal deployment in an interview with the New York Times last week, saying: “We don’t have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I’m all for it.” The newspaper said he had made clear he “avidly supported President Trump”.\nThe comments sparked an uproar, with critics noting longstanding federal law widely bans the domestic deployment of troops for criminal law enforcement duties.\nBenioff’s pro-Trump remarks also suggested a sharp turn from his previous support of liberal policies. During Trump’s first administration, he was outspoken about wealth inequality, backing a 2018 local ballot measure to tax large corporations in San Francisco to increase funding for homeless services. He called out other billionaires for “hoarding” their wealth in a Guardian interview at the time and criticized opponents of the measure, saying: “You’re either for the homeless or you’re for yourself.”\nThe CEO mostly lives in Hawaii now, according to the New York Times.\nHe walked back his comments days after Trump suggested San Francisco could be the next target for federal troops’ deployment. California and city leaders have said the intervention was not welcome or necessary, and immigrants’ rights groups said they were bracing for a possible increase in raids, arrests and detentions.\nBenioff said in last week’s interview that he believed San Francisco needed 1,000 more officers added to its 1,500-size force. During his conference, he said, there would be “cops on every corner … how it used to be”.\nTrump has repeatedly used false and exaggerated claims about out-of-control crime to justify federal crackdowns in liberal cities, which have attracted mass protests met with aggressive law enforcement responses.\nSpeaking to the FBI director on Wednesday, the president said: “I’m going to be strongly recommending, at the request of government officials … that you start looking at San Francisco … one of our great cities 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and now it’s a mess … Every American deserves to live in a community where they’re not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted or shot.”\nCalifornia’s governor, Gavin Newsom, responded by noting he was San Francisco’s mayor 15 years ago when Trump said the city was “great”, and saying the city had seen a 45% drop in homicides and 40% in robberies this year, compared with 2019.\nThe city’s mayor and law enforcement leaders also touted declining crime and increasing police recruitment earlier this week, with the district attorney saying local leaders “have this issue under control”.",

    "body": "The family of Isak Andic, the founder of the fashion chain Mango, have insisted on his son’s innocence after media reports suggested he was a potential suspect in the billionaire’s death.\nAndic died last December, aged 71, after apparently falling 100 metres down a ravine while hiking at Montserrat, near Barcelona, with his son, Jonathan. His death prompted tributes from politicians, journalists and the fashion world.\nAlthough an initial investigation by Catalan police, the Mossos d’Esquadra, had regarded it as an accident, officers and judicial sources told El País and La Vanguardia the case was now being treated as a possible homicide.\nIn a report published on Thursday evening, El País said sources had described Jonathan’s account of what happened as “inconsistent”, and said his father’s partner, the golfer Estefanía Knuth, had told investigators “the relationship between father and son was bad”.\nThe paper said police had found no direct or definitive evidence to explain what happened in the ravine, but had “come across a series of clues which, when taken together, had led them to move away from the idea of a mere accident and toward the possibility of a homicide”.\nLa Vanguardia reported that the judge overseeing the case changed Jonathan’s official status last month from witness to possible suspect.\nThe Andic family issued a statement to the media saying: “The Andic family has not and will not comment on Isak Andic’s death in all these months.\n“However, they wish to show their respect for the ongoing investigations and will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities, as they have done so far. They are also confident that this process will be concluded as soon as possible and that Jonathan Andic’s innocence will be proved.”\nA spokesperson for the Mossos d’Esquadra said the force could not comment because the case was still under judicial investigation. A spokesperson for the Catalan courts service said the judicial investigation was secret and “is not - nor has it been - directed against any specific person”.\nAndic, who was born to a Sephardic Jewish family in Istanbul in 1953, emigrated to Catalonia with his relatives in the late 1960s and started selling T-shirts to fellow high school students.\nHe progressed to running a wholesale business and sold clothes in street markets before opening his first Mango store in 1984.\n“He saw that we needed colour, style,” Mango’s global retail director, César de Vicente, told Agence France-Presse in March last year.\nAndic soon opened dozens more stores around Europe and “realised that having the same name, having the same brand in all the shops, would make the concept much stronger”, added de Vicente.",

    "body": "In New Zealand’s national museum, master Māori tattoo artists painstakingly apply ink to the faces of eight men and women as a large crowd watches on.\nThin lines spiral over the men’s cheeks, dipping towards the jaw and up over the forehead, while lines curl around the women’s chins – each mark telling the story of its wearer’s identity, lineage and experience. Surrounding them are their families, who sing and grip their hands as they lay still under the needle and weight of the sacred – and usually private – ceremony.\nThe artists are in the process of creating tā moko – traditional Māori tattoo – which has become increasingly visible in New Zealand. The ceremony held this month was opened to the public to mark new research that examined ancient preserved Māori heads, or toi moko, for insights on how traditional tattoo masters worked. Over three days, hundreds of people gathered to witness the rare event.\n“Our people have taken up moko by storm,” says Tamahou Temara, the general manger for arts organisation Toi Māori Aotearoa.\n“You wouldn’t see this 20-30 years ago – now moko is everywhere.”\nData about tā moko is scarce, but a 2018 Stats NZ study into Māori wellbeing suggested roughly 18% of the Māori population now wears traditional tattoo – a 3% increase on its first collection of the same data in 2013.\nNot only is tā moko becoming more prevalent in communities, it is slowly becoming more conspicuous in mainstream culture.\nThe co-leaders of Te Pāti Māori, the Māori party, wear tā moko, as did the former Labour foreign affairs minister Nanaia Mahuta. In 2022, Oriini Kaipara – now an MP – was the first woman with a moko kauae, or chin tattoo, to host mainstream prime-time television news.\nInsights from ancient practice\nFuelling a new era of tā moko artistry is recent research into 200 ancient preserved Māori heads, each detailed with intricate tattoos. The heads, which cultural protocol restricts from being shown, are held in a private atmosphere-controlled room at Te Papa, the national museum. The creation of toi moko predates European contact and it is unclear exactly how old the heads are.\nToi moko acted like a photograph of a loved one and, in some cases, the heads of enemy chiefs were preserved as trophies of war. They were often placed in hard to access areas like caves, and brought out on significant occasions. The heads were occasionally traded between tribes, but trade ramped up with the arrival of settlers, who then carried them across the globe as curiosities and objects of scientific interest.\nSustained repatriation efforts over decades have brought many of them home and the research – led by contemporary tattoo masters and Te Papa – into the heads’ markings has unlocked insights into their histories, genealogies and the artistry of traditional Māori tattooing.\nSir Derek Lardelli, one of the master tattooists at the Te Papa event, says the research had “shaped our thinking around our own delivery as moko artists”.\nThe artists discovered previous generations showed “a total understanding” of human form, using the movement of skin and facial muscles to inform the placement of their tattoos, Lardelli says.\nThey would have also had to establish close, trusting, relationships with those receiving their tattoos.\n“You had to go to another space to get to that level of excellence – they weren’t just impregnating skin with ink, they were at times lacerating, cutting and incising,” Lardelli said.\nThe ancestral tattoo artists were “extreme artisans” who travelled widely, he says. Not only have their “signatures” – or distinct and personal marks - been found on toi moko heads, they appear in expert carvings of the time.\nExamining toi moko has compelled the contemporary artists to become more careful and deliberate in their markings “for the sake of the art and for the people that are wearing our art forms”, Lardelli says.\nRaniera Warren received a moko kanohi, or full facial tattoo, after master artist Raniera McGrath offered him a coveted chance to be tattooed.\nWarren’s moko tells the story of his journey to learn his Māori language later in life, so he can pass the language on to his five children. Also included in his markings are designs found on the ancestral heads.\n“The tattoos were all designed to bring those [markings] back, so they wouldn’t get lost,” he says. “It was a beautiful experience to be a part of.”",

    "body": "Donald Trump will discuss the possible supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a meeting at the White House on Friday. It will be the fourth face-to-face meeting for the US and Ukrainian presidents since Trump returned to office in January, and their second in less than a month.\nWhat are Tomahawk missiles? Tomahawk land attack missiles, first used in combat in 1991, are long-range, guided cruise missiles typically launched from sea to attack targets in deep-strike missions. The longest range variant, the nuclear-capable Block II, entered service in 1983 and had a range of up to 1,550 miles (2,500km). Modern conventional variants have a range of 995 miles (1,600km). They fly low to the ground at a speed of 550 miles an hour.\nThe missiles are 6.1 metres long, with a 2.5-metre wingspan, and weigh about 1,510kg. They cost an estimated $1.3m (£1m) each.\nWhy does Ukraine want them? Supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would significantly expand its strike capabilities, enabling it to hit targets deep inside Russian territory, including military bases, logistics hubs, airfields and command centres that are currently beyond reach, with accurate, destructive munitions. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that there are hundreds of Russian military targets within range of Tomahawks.\nUkraine has argued that such capabilities would help compel Vladimir Putin to take Trump’s calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously.\nOn Tuesday, Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, argued Tomahawks could be particularly effective because Russia’s size makes air defence coverage difficult .\nmap showing tomahawk missile range into russua What are the downsides from Ukraine’s point of view? Tomahawks are normally launched from ships and submarines, which Ukraine does not have. There is a relatively new land-launched variant, the Typhon, more obviously suitable for Ukraine, but the launchers are in short supply. The US army is known only to have two, although another launcher, the X-Mav, which is considered more mobile than the Typhon, was demonstrated this week.\nAdditionally, they are only available in relatively small numbers, estimated by some experts at 20 to 50 missiles. The missiles are generally considered most effective if launched in salvoes, which would be difficult with limited numbers.\nWhat has Trump said about selling Tomahawks to Ukraine? Trump has repeatedly hinted in recent weeks that he could deliver Tomahawks. Simultaneously the Trump administration has authorised the sharing of US intelligence to help Ukraine carry out precision strikes on Russia’s oil refineries using domestically produced drones and Atacms. These attacks have led to fuel shortages and a sharp rise in gasoline prices across Russia.\nHowever, the US president’s conciliatory tone after a phone call with Vladimir Putin on Thursday left in question the likelihood of immediate assistance to Ukraine and reignited European fears of US capitulation to Moscow.\nTrump said Putin “didn’t like it” when he raised the possibility of supplying Tomahawks during the call, while also saying the US could not “deplete” its own supply. “We need them too, so I don’t know what we can do about that,” Trump said.\nThe key question is whether Trump is dangling the prospect of supplying Tomahawks to pressure Putin, while remaining unwilling to take a step that could bring the US closer to direct confrontation with a leader he still calls a “close friend”.\nWhat has the Kremlin said? The Kremlin has said Ukraine’s reliance on Washington for training, logistics and targeting intelligence to operate Tomahawks would draw the US into the war on a scale not seen before, undoing the progress Moscow claims to have made with the Trump administration.\nPutin himself said last week that their transfer would mark a “qualitatively new stage of escalation”, a point echoed by the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Thursday.",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the author of the hit self-help memoir I Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, has died at the age of 35.\nAccording to the Korean organ donation agency, Baek saved five lives through the donation of her heart, lungs, liver and both kidneys.\n“But her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing”, said Anton Hur, who translated her works into English.\nI Want to Die But I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018 in Korea and 2022 in the UK by Bloomsbury, follows Baek’s conversations with her psychiatrist about her dysthymia, which is persistent depression, and includes mini essays.\nA follow-up, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in the UK last year. Tteokbokki, Baek’s favourite food, is a Korean dish of rice cakes cooked in a spicy sauce.\nThe first book has sold about 600,000 copies in Korea, and over a million copies worldwide, having been published in more than 25 countries.\nBorn in 1990, Baek studied creative writing at university before working for five years at a publishing house.\nShe received psychiatric treatment for 10 years. The idea for her memoir began after she posted notes from therapy in a blog, and received positive feedback. When one commenter “said it was like a light was shining into the darkness of their life, I was so surprised”, she said in a 2023 interview with PEN. Writing a book had been a “bucket list” item, and “I was having trouble finding the right theme, but I realised something I could write about with some authority was depression.”\nBaek said that writing “can help you see yourself from different angles,” which “can be a way of regarding yourself three-dimensionally.”\nBaek “wanted to write, to share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope”, said her sister in a statement reported by the Korea Herald. “Knowing her gentle nature, incapable of harbouring hatred, I hope she can now rest peacefully.”\nThe cause of Baek’s death is unclear.",

    "body": "I can still remember walking on to the manicured grounds of Mar-a-Lago for the first time. It was early morning – my dad’s shift began at 7am, and I’d caught a ride to work with him. Already the air was heavy and moist, and the club’s 20 acres of carefully landscaped greens and lawns seemed to shimmer.\nMy dad was responsible for maintaining the resort’s in-room air-conditioning units, not to mention its five championship tennis courts, so he knew his way around. I remember he gave me a brief tour before presenting me to the hiring manager, who agreed to take me on. That first day, I was given a uniform – a white polo shirt, emblazoned with the Mar-a-Lago crest, and a short white skirt – and a name tag that said JENNA in all capital letters. (Although I was called Virginia, everyone at home called me Jenna.)\nAfter a few days, my dad said he wanted to introduce me to Mr Trump himself. They weren’t friends, exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that – I’d seen photos of them posing together, shaking hands. So one day my father took me to Trump’s office. “This is my daughter,” Dad said, and his voice sounded proud. Trump couldn’t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there. “Do you like kids?” he asked. “Do you babysit at all?” He explained that he owned several houses next to the resort that he lent to friends. Soon I was making extra money a few nights a week, minding the children of the elite.\nBut it was my day job that gave me my first real vision of a better future. The spa, like the resort itself, was gilded, with luxe finishes and an immaculate, sparkling decor. There were giant gold bathtubs, like something a god would soak in. I marvelled at how peaceful everyone seemed to feel within its walls. My duties – making tea, tidying the bathrooms, restocking towels – kept me just outside the inner sanctum of the massage rooms, but I could see how relaxed clients looked when they emerged. I seized on the idea that, with the right training, I could eventually make a living by helping others reduce stress. Maybe, I thought, their healing would fuel my own.\nThen one steaming hot day some weeks before my 17th birthday, I was walking toward the Mar-a-Lago spa, on my way to work, when a car slowed behind me. Inside was a British socialite named Ghislaine Maxwell and her driver, Juan Alessi, whom she insisted on calling “John”. Alessi would later testify under oath that on this day, when Maxwell spotted me – my long blond hair, my slim build, and what he called my notably “young” appearance – she commanded him from the back seat, “Stop, John, stop!”\nAlessi did as he was told, and I found out later that Maxwell got out and followed me. I didn’t know it yet, but an apex predator was closing in.\nPicture a girl in a crisp white uniform sitting behind a marble reception desk. The girl is slender, with the freckled face of a child, and her long blond hair is held back with a tie. On this blisteringly hot afternoon, the spa is mostly empty, so the girl is at the front desk, reading a book about anatomy that she’s borrowed from the library. The girl hopes that studying this book will give her something she’s lacked for too long: purpose. What would it be like, she wonders, to excel at something?\nI look up from my book to see a striking woman with short dark hair striding toward me.\n“Hello,” the woman says warmly. She looks to be in her late 30s, and her British accent reminds me of Mary Poppins. I couldn’t tell you which designers she’s wearing, but I bet her purse cost more than my dad’s truck. The woman extends her manicured hand for me to shake. “Ghislaine Maxwell,” she says, pronouncing her first name “Giilen”. I point to my name tag. “I’m Jenna,” I say, smiling like I’ve been told to smile. The woman’s eyes alight on my book, which I’ve jammed with sticky notes. “Are you interested in massage?” she asks. “How wonderful!”\nRemembering my duties, I offer this mesmerising woman a beverage, and she chooses hot tea. I go and fetch it, returning with a steaming cup. I expect that to be the end of it, but the woman keeps on talking. Maxwell says she knows a wealthy man – a longtime Mar-a-Lago member, she says – who is looking for a massage therapist to travel with him. “Come meet him,” she says. “Come tonight after work.”\nEven today, more than 20 years later, I remember how excited I felt. As instructed, I wrote down her phone number and her rich friend’s address: 358 El Brillo Way. “See you later, I hope,” Maxwell said, waving her right hand by twisting it slightly at the wrist. Then she was gone.\nA few hours later, Dad gave me a lift to El Brillo Way. The drive took five minutes, and we didn’t talk much. No one ever had to explain to my father the importance of making a buck.\nWhen we arrived we found ourselves in front of a sprawling two-storey, six-bedroom mansion. In countless TV documentaries, this house has been shown painted a tasteful white, as it was years later. But in the summer of 2000, the home we pulled up to was a garish pink, the colour of Pepto-Bismol.\nI jumped out of the car before my dad could turn off the engine, walked to the big wooden front door, and rang the bell. Maxwell answered and came outside. “Thank you so very much for dropping her off,” she told Dad, all smiles, but, in retrospect, she seemed impatient for him to leave.\n“Jeffrey has been waiting to meet you,” she said, starting up the stairs. “Come.”\nWalking behind her, I tried not to stare at the walls, which were crowded with photos and paintings of nude women. Maybe this was how wealthy people with sophisticated taste decorated their homes?\nWhen we reached the second-floor landing, Maxwell turned right and led me into a bedroom. We made a U-turn around a king-size bed, then entered an adjoining room with a massage table. A naked man lay face down on top of it, his head resting on his folded arms, but when he heard us enter, he lifted up slightly to look around at me. I remember his bushy eyebrows and the deep lines in his face as he grinned.\n“Say hello to Mr Jeffrey Epstein,” Maxwell instructed. But before I could do so, the man spoke to me: “You can just call me Jeffrey.” He was 47 years old – nearly three times older than me.\nFaced with Epstein’s bare backside, I looked to Maxwell for guidance. I had never had a massage before, let alone given one. But still I thought, “Isn’t he supposed to be under a sheet?” Maxwell’s blase expression indicated that nudity was normal. “Calm down,” I told myself. “Don’t blow this chance.”\nPalm Beach was just 16 miles from my home town, Loxahatchee, but the economic divide made it seem way farther. I needed to learn how rich people did things. Besides, while the man on the table was nude, it’s not like I was alone with him. The fact that a woman was with me made me breathe easier.\nShe began the lesson. When giving a massage, she said, I should keep one palm on the client’s skin at all times, so as never to startle him. “Continuity and flow are key,” she explained. We started in on his heels and arches, then moved up his body. When we got to his buttocks, I tried to glide past them, landing on his lower back. But Maxwell put her hands on top of mine and guided them to his rear. “It’s important that you don’t ignore any part of the body,” she said. “If you skip around, the blood won’t flow right.”\nOnly later would I see how, step by practised step, the two of them were breaking down my defences. Every time I felt a twinge of discomfort, one glance at Maxwell told me I was overreacting. And so it went for about half an hour: a seemingly legitimate massage lesson.\nEpstein asked me questions. “Do you have siblings?” Two brothers, I said. “Where do you go to high school?” I told him I’d quit after ninth grade, but I was only 16. “Do you take birth control?” Epstein asked. Was that a weird question in a job interview? Epstein indicated this was just his way of getting to know me. After all, I might soon be travelling with him. I told him I was on the pill.\n“You’re doing great,” Maxwell said, as I kept my hands in sync with hers.\n“Tell me about your first time,” Epstein said then. I hesitated. Who’d ever heard of an employer asking an applicant about losing her virginity? But I wanted this job, so I took a deep breath and described my rough childhood. I’d been abused by a family friend, I said vaguely, and spent time on the street as a runaway. Epstein didn’t recoil. Instead, he made light of it, teasing me for being “a naughty girl”.\n“Not at all,” I said defensively. “I’m a good girl. I’ve just always found myself in the wrong places.”\nEpstein lifted his head and smirked at me. “It’s OK,” he said. “I like naughty girls.”\nThen he rolled over on to his back, and I was startled to see he had an erection. Without thinking, I raised both my hands, holding them up in the air as if to say, “Stop.” But when I looked at Maxwell, she remained unfazed. Ignoring his aroused penis, she put both hands on his right pectoral muscles and began kneading. “Like this,” she said, continuing as if nothing were amiss. “You want to push the blood away from the heart.”\nEpstein winked at her then and moved his right hand down to his crotch. “You don’t mind, do you?” he asked as he began stroking himself.\nThis is the moment that something cracked inside me. How else to explain why my memories of what came next are splintered into jagged shards? Maxwell peeling off her clothes, a mischievous look on her face; Maxwell behind me, unzipping my skirt and pulling my Mar-a-Lago polo shirt over my head; Epstein and Maxwell laughing at my underwear, which were dotted with tiny hearts. “How cute – she still wears little girl’s panties,” Epstein said. He reached for a vibrator, which he forced between my thighs, as Maxwell commanded me to pinch Epstein’s nipples as she rubbed her own breasts, and mine.\nA familiar emptiness flooded me. How many times had I put my faith in someone, only to be hurt and humiliated? I could feel my brain begin to shut down. My body couldn’t escape from this room, but my mind couldn’t bear to stay, so it put me on a kind of autopilot: submissive and determined to survive.\nSo many young women, myself included, have been criticised for returning to Epstein’s lair even after we knew what he wanted from us. How can you complain about being abused, some have asked, when you could so easily have stayed away? But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable. Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care. A master manipulator, he threw what looked like a lifeline to girls who were drowning. If they wanted to be dancers, he offered dance lessons. If they aspired to be actors, he said he’d help them get roles. And then, he did his worst to them.\nOne day, probably two weeks after I’d met them, Epstein upped the ante. I was upstairs, cleaning up after another “massage”, when Epstein told me to come to his office. “How about you quit your job at Mar-a-Lago,” he said, “and work for me full-time?” He wanted to make things easier on me, he said. But he had a few conditions. As his employee, I would be at his beck and call, day and night. And another thing: I could no longer live in my parents’ trailer. Seeing me come and go at all hours might make them suspicious, he said. He held out a wad of cash – probably $2,500. “Use this,” he said, “to rent yourself an apartment.”\nI’d never held that much money in my hand before. I thanked him, even as a twinge of worry crept into my head. By this point, I had seen dozens of girls coming and going from his house. Many came once and never returned. If he got rid of them so quickly, would Epstein eventually throw me away, too? Epstein must’ve sensed my qualms, because he walked around his desk, picked up a grainy photograph, and handed it to me. The image had been taken from some distance, but it was unmistakably my little brother. I felt a stab of fear.\n“We know where your brother goes to school,” Epstein said. He let that sink in for a moment, then got to the point: “You must never tell a soul what goes on in this house.” He was smiling, but his threat was clear. “And I own the Palm Beach police department,” he said, “so they won’t do anything about it.”\nFrom the start, Epstein and Maxwell held me to my promise to be available at all times. Some days, the call would come in the morning. I’d show up, perform whatever sex acts Epstein wanted, then hang out beside his vast swimming pool while he got some work done. If Maxwell was there, I was often told to attend to her sexually as well. She kept a bin of vibrators and sex toys handy for these sessions. But she never demanded sex from me one-on-one – only when we were with Epstein. Sometimes there were other girls there, too, and I’d end up staying at El Brillo Way all day.\nIn October 2000, Maxwell jetted off to New York to meet up with her old friend Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth II’s second-born son. On Halloween, along with other guests that included Donald Trump and his future wife Melania Knauss, Maxwell and Prince Andrew attended a party hosted by German supermodel Heidi Klum at The Hudson, a swank hotel. Maxwell was proud of her friendships with famous people, especially men. She loved to talk about how easily she could get former president Bill Clinton on the phone; she and Epstein had visited the White House together when Clinton was in office.\nWhile they usually slept in separate bedrooms, and rarely kissed or held hands, it seemed to me that Maxwell and Epstein lived in complete symbiosis. Epstein, who described Maxwell as his best friend, valued her knack for connecting him to powerful people. Maxwell, in turn, appreciated that Epstein had the resources to fund the lavish life she thought she deserved yet had trouble affording after the death of her father, the media mogul Robert Maxwell. In social settings, Maxwell often appeared vivacious, the life of the party. But in Epstein’s household, she functioned more as a party planner: scheduling and organising the endless parade of girls who she recruited to have sex with him. Over time, I would come to see Epstein and Maxwell less as boyfriend and girlfriend, and more as two halves of a wicked whole.\nWhen I think back on this period, I’m not proud of myself. Even though the adult me knows that the child me was battling just to survive, I wince at how passive I had become. I was turning more and more to Xanax and other drugs, which were prescribed by doctors Maxwell sent me to. Sometimes, when I was really struggling, I took as many as eight Xanax a day.\nEpstein and Maxwell began lending me out to their friends. The first time, he made it sound as if he were launching me on an exciting new phase of my “massage training”. My new “clients”, as Epstein described them, were a man and his pregnant wife. Both needed massages, Epstein said. They were staying at The Breakers, an exclusive Palm Beach hotel not far from El Brillo Way, and Epstein had specific instructions for how I was to treat them. “Make her comfortable. But save most of your energy for him.” When Epstein said this, I looked up. Did he mean what I thought he meant? “Give him whatever he wants,” Epstein confirmed. “Just like you do for me.”\nThat night I took a taxi to The Breakers. The man – I’ll call him Billionaire Number One – and his wife were staying in an apartment in the residential section of the vast property. When I arrived, they showed me to the master bedroom, where I would work on the woman first. As a joke, Maxwell had warned me that I could induce premature labor if I massaged the woman’s ankles “in the wrong way”. I knew nothing about prenatal massage, but I did my best, avoiding her ankles altogether. After about 45 minutes, the woman said she was going to go to sleep.\nThe apartment was dark, and I had to tiptoe around a bit before I found Billionaire Number One in a sitting-room area, taking off his clothes. I hoped against hope that a massage was all this stranger was expecting. I was kneading his muscles when he looked up, groaned, and asked me, “Wouldn’t you be more comfortable working in the nude?” I was disappointed, but not surprised. We had sex on the floor, and afterward, he tipped me $100. As I left that night, I felt that familiar scooped-out, empty feeling.\nThe second person I was lent out to was a psychology professor whose research Epstein was helping to fund. He was a quirky little man with a balding pate of white hair, and, from his nervous affect, it seemed he wasn’t used to being with women. The man never asked directly for sex, but Epstein had made clear that was what he expected. “Keep him happy, like you did with your first client,” Epstein had said. So when the professor asked at one point for “one of your famous massages that Jeffrey has told me so much about”, I complied. We only had sex once, though. The next night, the man told me he wanted to watch movies instead. I was glad, but I remember feeling worried that I’d somehow disappointed the professor in a way that he’d share with Epstein.\nThe psychologist was only the first of many academics from prestigious universities who I was forced to service sexually. I didn’t know it then, but Epstein had spent years campaigning to keep company with the world’s biggest thinkers. Epstein had convinced himself that he – a college dropout – was on the same level as degree-holding innovators and theoreticians, and because he funded many of their research projects and flew them around on his jets, he was largely welcomed into their fold.\nScientists weren’t the only people Epstein used his vast resources to win access to – which is how I came to be trafficked to a multitude of powerful men. Among them were a gubernatorial candidate who was soon to win election in a western state and a former US senator. Since Epstein usually neglected to introduce me to these men by name, I would only learn who some of them were years later, when I studied photographs of Epstein’s associates and recognised their faces.\nOn 10 March 2001 we were in London, staying at Maxwell’s pied-à-terre – a white mews house a short walk from Hyde Park. Maxwell woke me up that morning by announcing in a singsongy voice: “Get out of bed, sleepyhead!” It was going to be a special day, she said. Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince! Her old friend Prince Andrew would be dining with us that night, she said, and we had lots to do to get me ready.\nMaxwell and I spent most of that day shopping. She bought me an expensive purse from Burberry and three different outfits. When we got back to her house, I laid them out on the bed. There were two sexy, sophisticated dresses she’d picked out and a third option that I’d lobbied for: a pink V-necked, sleeveless mini-T-shirt and a sparkly, multicolored pair of jeans embroidered with a pattern of interlocking horses. After I showered and dried my hair, I put on the jeans and top, which left a strip of my stomach exposed. Maxwell wasn’t thrilled, but like most teenage girls then, I idolised Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and the third outfit was something I imagined the two of them might wear.\nWhen Prince Andrew arrived at the house that evening, Maxwell was more coquettish than usual. “Guess Jenna’s age,” she urged the prince, after she introduced me. The Duke of York, who was then 41, guessed correctly: 17. “My daughters are just a little younger than you,” he told me, explaining his accuracy. As usual, Maxwell was quick with a joke: “I guess we will have to trade her in soon.”\nIn contrast to his appearance today – stout, white-haired and jowly – Prince Andrew then was still relatively fit, with short-cropped brown hair and youthful eyes. He’d long been known as the playboy of the royal family. When I noticed that Epstein called the prince “Andy”, I began to call him that, too.\nAs we chatted in Maxwell’s entryway, I suddenly thought of something: my mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn’t pose for a picture. I ran to get a Kodak FunSaver from my room, then returned and handed it to Epstein. I remember the prince putting his arm around my waist as Maxwell grinned beside me. Epstein snapped the photo.\nAfter a bit more small talk, the four of us headed out into the cold spring air. We went to a restaurant for dinner and afterward to an exclusive nightclub called Tramp. The prince went to the bar and came back with a cocktail for me. Then he invited me to dance. He was sort of a bumbling dancer, and I remember he sweated profusely. On the way back, Maxwell told me, “When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.”\nBack at the house, Maxwell and Epstein said goodnight and headed upstairs, signalling it was time that I take care of the prince. In the years since, I’ve thought a lot about how he behaved. He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright. I drew him a hot bath. We disrobed and got in the tub, but didn’t stay there long because the prince was eager to get to the bed. He was particularly attentive to my feet, caressing my toes and licking my arches. That was a first for me, and it tickled. I was nervous he would want me to do the same to him. But I needn’t have worried. He seemed in a rush to have intercourse. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.\nThe next morning, Maxwell told me: “You did well. The prince had fun.” Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called “Randy Andy”.\nMy second encounter with Prince Andrew took place about a month later, at Epstein’s townhouse in New York. Epstein greeted Andrew and brought him to the living room, where Maxwell and I were sitting. Another one of their victims, Johanna Sjoberg, arrived soon afterward. Maxwell then announced to the prince that she’d purchased him a joke gift, a puppet that looked just like him. She suggested we pose for a photo with it. The prince and I sat down next to each other on the couch, and Maxwell put the puppet in my lap, positioning one of its hands on one of my breasts. Then she put Sjoberg on the prince’s lap, and the prince put his hand on Sjoberg’s breast. The symbolism was impossible to ignore. Johanna and I were Maxwell and Epstein’s puppets, and they were pulling the strings.\nI don’t know exactly when I had sex with Prince Andrew for the third time, but I do know the location: a 72-acre island Epstein owned in the US Virgin Islands. The private sanctuary, right next to Saint Thomas island, was called Little Saint James, but Epstein liked to call it “Little Saint Jeff’s”. I also know that it was not just the two of us this time; it was an orgy. “I was around 18,” I said in a sworn declaration in 2015. “Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together. The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn’t really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn’t really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.”\nSince I gave that account, Epstein’s pilot has said in a deposition that a coded notation (“AP”) that he made on his flight log for 4 July 2001, referred to Prince Andrew. He said that Epstein, the prince, another woman and I flew from Saint Thomas that day back to Palm Beach. I guess it’s possible that the orgy I remember occurred in the days leading up to that flight, which would mean I was still 17. I’ll probably never know the date for certain. What I do know, because Epstein told me, is that Jean-Luc Brunel, the French modelling agent who was also in attendance, supplied the other girls who took part.\nFor all that’s happened to expose Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, more action is needed. Because some people still think Epstein was an anomaly, an outlier. And those people are wrong. While the sheer number of victims Epstein preyed upon may put him in a class by himself, he was no outlier. The way he viewed women and girls – as playthings to be used and discarded – is not uncommon among certain powerful men who believe they are above the law. And many of those men are still going about their daily lives, enjoying the benefits of their power.\nDon’t be fooled by those in Epstein’s circle who say they didn’t know what he was doing. Epstein not only didn’t hide what was happening, he took a certain glee in making people watch. And people did watch – scientists, fundraisers from the Ivy League and other heralded institutions, titans of industry. They watched and they didn’t care.\nVirginia Giuffre died by suicide on 25 April 2025. In February 2022 her lawyers obtained a settlement from Prince Andrew. It was made without any admission of liability on his part and he continues to deny Giuffre’s allegations that he had sex with her, that she had been trafficked to him by Epstein or indeed that he had even met her",

    "body": "The FBI has accused a Louisiana resident of participating in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 – then lying about his past and fraudulently obtaining a visa to live in the US.\nAccording to a recently unsealed FBI criminal complaint, Mahmoud Amin Ya’qub al-Muhtadi armed himself and gathered a group to cross from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel during the attack that left nearly 1,200 people dead.\nHamas fighters also kidnapped more than 250 people, including dozens of US citizens, during the raid. On 13 October, Hamas released the 20 remaining living hostages after the two sides agreed to a tenuous ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.\nAl-Muhtadi was an operative of the Gaza-based military wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, according to the complaint prepared by FBI supervisory special agent Alexandria M Thoman O’Donnell and submitted to a federal judge on 6 October. O’Donnell serves on a taskforce investigating the murder and kidnapping of American citizens during the 7 October attack.\nOn his US visa application, al-Muhtadi denied he had ever been involved in terrorist activities and became a legal permanent resident in 2024, the complaint says.\nAccording to a statement posted by the justice department on Friday, al-Muhtadi’s presence in the US was discovered by Joint Task Force October 7, an initiative launched in March this year, and was investigated by the taskforce members and the FBI in New Orleans.\nAlongside US law enforcement agencies, the statement credits the help of seven Israeli security organizations, including Lahav 433, an Israeli crime-fighting umbrella organization, with his apprehension.\n“After hiding out in the United States, this monster has been found and charged with participating in the atrocities of October 7 – the single deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust,” said the US attorney general, Pam Bondi.\nAl-Muhtadi was expected to appear in court on Friday and it was unclear whether he has legal representation.\nThe complaint says the agent requested an arrest warrant for al-Muhtadi on 6 October but does not specify when and where he was taken into custody. The complaint says he could face charges for visa fraud and for conspiring to provide support for a foreign terrorist organization.\nInmate records show someone with the same name and age is being held at the correctional center in St Martin parish, Louisiana, near Lafayette. He was scheduled to appear in federal court on Friday.\nAl-Muhtadi’s social media and email accounts revealed a years-long affiliation with a Hamas-aligned paramilitary group, including carrying out firearms training, according to the FBI.\nOn the morning of 7 October 2023, after Hamas forces attacked Israel, the then-military commander of Hamas, Mohammed Deif, called for “the masses” to join in.\nThe complaint alleges that al-Muhtadi “was among those who answered Hamas’s call to arms” after being alerted to the attack via social media at 6.34am.\nAl-Muhtadi told his associates to “get ready” and “bring the rifles” – and that “there is kidnapping, and it’s a game, which will be a good one”, according to phone calls reviewed by the FBI. He also asked an associate to bring ammunition.\nThe FBI says al-Muhtadi coordinated an armed group to travel into Israel and that during the attack his phone pinged a cell tower near Kfar Aza, an Israeli village where dozens of residents were killed and approximately 19 were kidnapped.\nIn June 2024, al-Muhtadi submitted an electronic US visa application in Cairo. In the application, he denied serving in any paramilitary organization or having ever engaged in terrorist activities. His application said he intended to live in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and work in “car repairs or food services”. He entered the US in September 2024.\nAl-Muhtadi lived in Tulsa through May but by early June had relocated to Lafayette, where he worked for a local restaurant, the FBI says.\nAn unidentified FBI agent repeatedly met with al-Muhtadi in Lafayette from July to September this year.\nAn associate advised al-Muhtadi not to contact anyone from the paramilitary group because he was under surveillance in the US and to avoid posting on social media in support of Hamas. The FBI says al-Muhtadi responded that he could post whatever he wanted, including pictures of Hamas leaders, and he would be safe.",

    "body": "In a turn of events that may surprise some, Donald Trump expressed a few relatable insecurities this week. First he questioned the attractiveness of his beach body, then he blasted Time magazine for an unflattering cover photo. In fairness, he wasn’t wrong. He called the picture, taken from below, “the worst of all time”. People have focused on the wattle neck, the gossamer hair, the inside of his nostrils.\nThe question he asked of the editorial decision was actually a pertinent one. “What are they doing, and why?” This is the kind of scrutiny that the press should attract, except that media literacy is dying a fast death – and that has a lot to do with Trump himself. Constantly lambasting Pulitzer prize-winning publications as “fake news” and then retweeting Photoshopped images and deep fakes isn’t helping the situation.\nHere are some past memorable Trump covers – some of which he admired, and others which, in no uncertain terms, he did not.\nTime, 2024\nThis is no doubt a cover much more to the President’s liking. Love him or despise him, it’s undeniable that standing up mere seconds after a bullet grazes the side of one’s head and yelling “Fight, fight, fight!” is a brave move. Crazy maybe, but brave. The photo of that moment, shot by Evan Vucci, will go down as one of the most significant images in political history.\nTime and Trump have a turbulent relationship. He famously mocked up covers of himself to hang at four of his golf clubs, which resulted in the magazine writing to the President to ask him to remove them (and a pillorying cartoon from The New Yorker). The magazine has issued a number of memorable covers of Trump, including an illustration of stormy conditions in the Oval Office, and one of his golf cart stuck in a bunker.\nOne of his more recent Time covers was when he was named Person of the Year – a title Trump has received twice. (Although he once claimed he had turned it down, Time magazine denied it in a statement.) Before Trump entered the White House for the first time, he had only featured on the cover of the magazine once, in 1989. But in 2017 he falsely claimed to have been on the cover more times than anybody else. In fact Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan at that time surpassed him.\nOn the second occasion he received his Person of the Year designation, Trump said: “Well, thank you very much. This is an honor, a tremendous honor.” (Up for debate, when previous recipients include Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.) He was pleased too with one Time cover, brandishing it at a rally in Des Moines. “They used to call it the ‘Man of the Year,’ but they can’t do that anymore. They call it ‘Person of the Year.’ It’s the same thing. That’s fine. But look at that – that’s a good-looking cover.”\nEsquire, 2004\nWhile Trump may not have featured on the Time cover very much pre-politics, he did feature on many others as New York’s brash, publicity-seeking business mogul and Manhattan social scene fixture. Trump is obsessed with gold. He loves bling. It makes sense then that Esquire would kit him out in medallions and rings galore. Also shout out to the accompanying cover lines of: “Wild tales of strippers! Streakers! Tsunamis! Leopard Attacks!” Talk about something for everybody. And note the other feature: “The Case for Bush”. This is not, in fact, an editorial on pubic hair, but about George W.\nOh, and the strap for the Trump story? “How I’d Run the Country (Better)”. Indeed, Trump’s first mention of his wish to achieve the highest office was circa 1987. Turns out we should have taken him both seriously and literally.\nC 41, 2016\nAn extremely innovative cover from the Milan-based magazine dedicated to all things design and style. Layering the cover with a Trompe-l’œil style technique (pun possibly intended), the magazine’s gallery arm put on an exhibition entitled American Change, in which this cover, created by Japanese artist Kensuke Koike, features. A copy of the magazine was also included in the London Design Museum’s Hope to Nope show.\nThere are other similarly themed covers; Trump’s mouth is rather a subject of fascination. Note that impressionists will first attempt to nail his voice; then the second thing is the puckering of the mouth. Recently, the queen of the Netherlands was caught mocking Trump’s lip movements – a bold move given he was standing right next to her. Some might liken the general aesthetic of this particular maw to a cat’s bum, but that wouldn’t be me. What is good about this cover is it is a departure from the usual way cover designers depict Trump’s mouth – which is black text across his philtrum to resemble a Hitler moustache. It’s been done, guys. Many, many times.\nVanity Fair, 2024\nIn the past few years outlets have taken to producing digital covers for online readers. This was a striking one in 2024 from Vanity Fair, not just for the pore-intense close-up, but the directly presented set of numbers down the lefthand side. Can’t really complain when the facts add up. The cover went viral on its release, with millions of likes and views on X alone.\nTrump has a history of beef with Vanity Fair. In particular with its former editor, Graydon Carter, who once referred to Trump as “a short-fingered vulgarian”. In turn, Trump has called Carter “a real loser”. Trump has often dissed the magazine on social media, and in 2016 tweeted: “Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!” He was right about the last part – but Carter stepped down in 2017, staying on longer than intended to cover the beginning of Trump’s administration.\nInternazionale, 2017\nThe matryoshka doll design isn’t super original, but this is very well executed from the progressive weekly Internazionale, which translates long-form articles from around the world into Italian. The implication of the cover is clear, and the detail is such that one doesn’t need the fully exposed face of Putin to recognise him. We can spot those thin lips and filler-enhanced cheeks anywhere.\nBloomberg Businessweek, 2016\nPerhaps the most unsettling of the bunch, courtesy of a 2016 Chinese edition of Bloomberg Businessweek. Trump likes to assert his reputation as a great businessman, which is questionable given his multiple bankruptcy filings. Nevertheless, he is currently receiving praise for his brokering of the Gaza ceasefire. (Maybe he listened to the audiobook of The Art of the Deal to brush up on his skills.)\nThe cover line translates to: “Donald Trump is a modern political Steve Jobs, turning his US presidential campaign into a one-man show.” This would have pleased Trump no end, as he seemed to have something of a crush on Jobs, tweeting many times about him in glowing terms. Except for when he declared: “I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs … but the yacht he built is truly ugly.”\nTrump, however, is very much not a fan of Steve Jobs’ widow, who holds shares in The Atlantic, opining that the late Apple designer would “not be happy” about Laurene Powell Jobs “wasting money” on the publication. (Powell Jobs also donated $930,000 to the 2020 Biden campaign.)\nPlayboy, 1990\nTrump is back in his playboy era here – literally. We know Trump is keen on this cover because he was pictured holding and signing the magazine not too long ago. (A signed copy is available on eBay for $4,000.) The truth is he does look good here. The suit is a much better fit than the one he wore to Buckingham Palace in 2019 – although true confirmation can only come from Menswear Guy.\nIn the cover interview, which you can read here, Trump appears to rule out a future run for the presidency – despite the topic being raised precisely because of his previous musings. Speaking about himself in the third person, he told the outlet: “The presidency? No, that takes an election, and it is clear that Trump is not that patient.”\nTrump will probably not be too happy to hear that Hugh Hefner’s son has said that his father “regretted” the cover. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in 2017, Cooper Hefner said: “We don’t respect the guy. There’s a personal embarrassment because Trump is somebody who has been on our cover.”\nNew York, 1992\nThe funniest thing about this cover is that the tie makes Trump look for all the world like he goes to an underperforming British comprehensive school. The tie is screaming Geography second period. And the stance? Organised fight behind the maths block at the end of last bell. The reason Trump has to “scramble off the canvas” to quote the subhead, is that in the late 80s Trump seemed down and out. As Politico has described it, the businessman “lost his mind” and “sowed the seeds of his near-ruin” with catastrophic financial choices. But if there’s one thing Trump has proved, it’s that he has staying power. He is the human embodiment of Chumbawamba’s biggest (only) hit.\nNew York, 2015\nIs there a headline that has aged worse than “Donald Trump Is Saving Our Democracy”? Probably not, what with him trying to organise a coup against the elected government.\nTrump’s hair is one of the most recognisable things about him, so this cover, digitally manipulated so he’s wearing wear a coiffed wig in emulation of George Washington, is quite the deviation. And while the reference to the founding father is obvious, the look does slightly veer towards nan’s perm.\nThe above two examples aren’t the only New York editions featuring striking covers of Trump. The “Loser” strap line is one, for which the magazine issued an online explanation. And there’s this one, which aged about as well as the Washington one.\nLibération, 2016\nThere’s nothing equivocal here. The left-leaning Libération melds what some might consider two of New York’s most famous villains, with Trump channelling Patrick Bateman. There’s also a touch of The Godfather. The French periodical is not the only publication to have referred to Trump on its cover as the Bret Easton Ellis character, with the New Statesman doing the same.\nIn terms of unsparing assessment, a competitor could be Die Welt’s no-nonsense strap line “Das Ende Der Welt” on a 2016 cover, which I feel even non-German speakers can take a stab at understanding. That was a great cover, featuring Trump as a roaring streak of anger in comet-form on track to consume the earth. Illustrated by Edel Rodriguez, it won a top prize at the Art Directors Club Germany awards. The magazine and Rodriguez followed up with a much more controversial and perhaps ill-judged cover of the President decapitating the State of Liberty.\nThe Economist, 2018\nOne for the pop culture aficionados. In 2013 Miley Cyrus’s certified banger Wrecking Ball (taken from the accurately titled album Bangerz) was riding high in the charts – and she was riding a giant wrecking ball in the music video. Memes abounded at the time, but five years on the Economist took inspiration and came out swinging with this cover. I’m not sure Trump suits the cherry Doc Martens that Cyrus wore in the video, but props to the illustrator Ben Kirchner for including them. And it is not impossible he does own the real thing – the singer auctioned the boots off for charity. The accompanying cover story you can read here.\nThe New Yorker, 2016\nThe symbol for the Democrats is a donkey and for the Republicans an elephant. The former has an association with Andrew Jackson (opponents called him a “jackass”), and the latter with Abraham Lincoln (“seeing the elephant” was a term used by soldiers during the Civil War). It’s a clever cover from The New Yorker to depict how Trump cleaved apart the old school GOP. It’s safe to say the Never Trump movement has failed abysmally – and now there are masked men dragging people off the street and it’s horrifying. But don’t forget: with the circus trick, the subject of the sawing is a volunteer.\nThe cover was illustrated by the New Yorker’s own Barry Blitt and given the title “Grand Illusion”. Blitt said it was the fourth time in less than a year he had drawn the President. There is a gallery of Blitt’s previous Trump covers here.",

    "body": "The National Republican Senatorial Committee crossed into dystopian new territory for political campaigning on Friday after releasing an attack ad that features an artificially generated video of the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer.\nThe deepfake video, posted on Friday to the Senate Republicans’ social media account, shows an AI-generated Schumer robotically repeating the phrase “every day gets better for us” in reference to the ongoing government shutdown. A small disclaimer tucked in the corner acknowledges its artificial origins.\n“Week 3 of the Schumer Shutdown: ‘Every day gets better for us,’” the post read, accompanied by the deepfake video looping the Democratic leader’s manufactured likeness.\nThe video has bewildered those who watched it online, given that the quote itself is real and on the record for Punchbowl News. In the original interview, Schumer explained that Democrats had prepared their healthcare-focused shutdown strategy well in advance, adding: “Their whole theory was – threaten us, bamboozle us and we would submit in a day or two.”\nYet rather than simply quote Schumer’s words, the NRSC, the campaign arm responsible for electing Republican senators and chaired by Tim Scott, a South Carolina senator, chose to manufacture synthetic video of him speaking.\n“Schumer thinks playing with Americans’ livelihoods is just a game,” the narrator says over the deepfake imagery. The advertisement goes on to feature other discussion on the shutdown, accusing Democrats of “loving” the political standoff.\nIn a response on X, Joanna Rodriguez, the NRSC communications director, said: “AI is here and not going anywhere. Adapt & win or pearl clutch & lose.”\nSchumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe video comes weeks after Donald Trump posted his own AI-generated deepfake to Truth Social, depicting Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, making crude and made-up statements about immigration and voter fraud that neither lawmaker uttered. In 2023, shortly after Joe Biden announced his re-election bid, the Republican National Committee responded with an AI-generated attack ad that imagined an apocalyptic version of the future should Biden win a second term. The video included, in faint text, the disclaimer: “Built entirely with AI imagery.”",

    "body": "Donald Trump has played down hopes that he will supply Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, saying during a White House meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the US may need them for a future conflict.\nResponding to a question on whether the US would send the cruise missiles requested by Ukraine, Trump said: “We need Tomahawks and we need a lot of other things that we’ve been sending over the last four years to Ukraine.\n“It’s not easy for us to give [Ukraine] … massive numbers of very powerful weapons,” he said. “Hopefully they won’t need it. Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks.”\nPutin tells Trump that Tomahawks deal would damage US-Russian relations Trump’s doubtful tone on the cruise missiles follows a surprise phone call with Vladimir Putin on Friday during which the Russian leader told Trump that supplying the Tomahawks would damage US-Russian relations. His position on supplying Ukraine with weapons has changed a number of times since he returned to office in January, often following negotiations with Putin or European backers of Ukraine.\nDuring the White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also discussed plans to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin in Hungary, saying it was “to be determined” whether Zelenskyy would join but that he would inform him of the discussions.\n“There is a lot of bad blood,” Trump said.\nRead the full story\nTrump says he has commuted sentence of George Santos in federal fraud case Donald Trump said Friday he had commuted the sentence of George Santos, the former US representative who is serving more than seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to fraud and identity theft charges.\nThe New York Republican was sentenced in April after admitting last year to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of 11 people – including his own family members – to make donations to his campaign.\nRead the full story\nJohn Bolton, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump in his first term, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges relating to diary-like notes he shared that contained top secret information with relatives and stored classified documents at his home.\nRead the full story\nFox News employees expressed concerns network was intentionally aiding Trump, legal filings reveal Multiple Fox News employees expressed concerns about the network’s editorial standards and the conduct of top hosts in an internal survey conducted in the summer and fall of 2020, with one going as far as to wonder if they had sold their “soul to the devil”, according to legal filings.\nThe employees’ statements were excerpted in a 771-page filing released last week, made public as part of a defamation lawsuit filed against the network by voting technology company Smartmatic.\nRead the full story\nYoung Republicans New York chapter suspended after racist chats leaked The New York Republican state committee has suspended the authorization of their Young Republicans chapter after members were implicated in highly offensive and racist messages that were obtained and published by Politico.\nRead the full story\nTrump claims Maduro willing to give ‘everything’ to ease US tensions Donald Trump used an expletive to threaten the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, on Friday, claiming that the leftist autocrat had offered major concessions to appease the US.\nThe US president was speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday during a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Asked about reports that Maduro offered “everything in his country, all the natural resources” to ease tensions, Trump agreed: “He’s offered everything; you’re right. You know why? Because he doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States.”\nRead the full story\nRepublicans use deepfake video of Chuck Schumer in new attack ad The National Republican Senatorial Committee crossed into dystopian new territory for political campaigning on Friday after releasing an attack ad that features an artificially generated video of the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer.\nThe deepfake video, posted on Friday to the Senate Republicans’ social media account, shows an AI-generated Schumer robotically repeating the phrase “every day gets better for us” in reference to the ongoing government shutdown. A small disclaimer tucked in the corner acknowledges its artificial origins.\nRead the full story\nTrump officials ask supreme court to permit national guard in Illinois The Trump administration has asked the US supreme court to allow the deployment of national guard troops to Illinois, as the president pushes to expand the domestic use of the military in a growing number of Democratic-led cities.\nIn an emergency filing, the justice department urged the court to overturn a lower court ruling that halted the deployment of several hundred national guard troops to the Chicago area.\nRead the full story\nWhat else happened today: Catching up?

But the statue of Confederate general Stonewall Jackson, which stood at the heart of a 2017 Ku Klux Klan rally, was given to a California-based arts non-profit, which pledged to use it for “transformation, not further veneration”.\nToday, that same Jackson equestrian statue, chopped apart and reconstructed by American artist Kara Walker, is in Los Angeles, the centerpiece of a new art exhibit reckoning with the US’s white supremacist monuments.\nWalker is famous for making art that grapples with racist images and archetypes, from her cavorting mock-historical silhouettes of plantation scenes, to the shark-filled fountain she erected in the Tate Modern as a monument to the British slave trade. Her work made her the obvious choice for transforming a prominent Confederate statue weighted with many decades of violent history\nFor the new exhibit, Jackson and his horse have been cut into pieces – “butchered”, in the words of co-curator Hamza Walker, into shank and round and rump – and then put back together to form a disjointed monster. The beast-man rears into the air, spare limbs flailing. Each detail is disturbing: the rider’s legs dangle backwards, with broken toes. His faceless head is perched on the beast’s snout. A clenched fist has tumbled to the ground.\nThe remade Jackson statue, titled Unmanned Drone, is a monument to the “horror”, rather than the myths, of American white supremacy, said Hamza Walker, the Los Angeles curator who has spent much of the past decade working to collect Confederate monuments that American cities have decided to remove. (Walker the artist and Walker the curator are not related.)\nA selection of these historic monuments to white power – some in pristine condition, some displayed spattered with paint or toppled on their sides, one reduced to a pile of bronze bars – will be on view in Los Angeles through May. The sweeping exhibition, which opens 23 October, couples the century-old statues with contemporary artworks, many by Black artists. Most of the Monuments exhibit is on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art (Moca), while Unmanned Drone stands alone at the Brick, the non-profit gallery that Hamza Walker leads.\n“There’s a healing aspect to doing this show, I think,” Kara Walker said Thursday at a preview for the exhibit. The violent political battles over the monuments showed “they do contain some kind of power”.\nIt was a “vital medicine”, she said, to have the monuments “removed from their pedestals and taken out of context and placed in a space in conversation with work by artists” whose very existence challenged white supremacy, and who had to overcome “the distractions of having to be erased and racialized in this country” in order to make their work.\nAt a time of violent white backlash in the United States, the old monuments make for unsettling viewing. These Confederates may be confined to a museum, but their ideological descendants are still very much on the march, working to ban the teaching of Black history, forcing Black leaders out of power and dismantling the Voting Rights Act.\n“It’s strange. It’s a very strange show,” Bennett Simpson, a senior curator at Moca and one of the show’s co-curators, said, when asked what it was like to spend so much time with Confederate monuments. “There’s a lot of beauty in it, but it’s heavy. It deals with real shit that people don’t often really want to deal with.”\n‘Recontextualized in an artistic exhibit’\nMany of the decommissioned Confederate monuments on view at Moca are massive, originally designed to sit atop stone pedestals and be viewed from below. Even placed directly on an art gallery floor, they loom.\nNear the entrance to the exhibit, a statue of two idealized white figures from Baltimore, Maryland, is displayed in its post-protest condition, spattered with blood-red paint. The face of Matthew Fontaine Maury, a commander in the Confederate navy, has been spray-painted to look like a clown, his face now grinning like the Joker’s.\nA piece of granite that once formed the base of the Robert E Lee monument in Charlottesville has been graffitied with the line: “As white supremacy crumbles.” Next to the stone fragment are two tidy piles of bronze ingots and some containers of charcoal and other debris, all that remains of the monument after it was quietly melted down in 2023.\nTo see these fraught Confederate objects “recontextualized within the context of an artistic exhibit” … “it takes away some of that power to harm”, said Jalane Schmidt, a professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, and one of the longtime Charlottesville activists who campaigned to have the statues removed.\nThe bronze ingots from the Lee statue have been stamped with a Biblical reference, “Swords into Ploughshares”, the name of the Charlottesville group now working with a handful of finalists on proposals for a new artwork to be made out of the old bronze. The goal, Schmidt said, is to choose an artist “who can craft public art for us that turns the hurt and the harm into healing and wholeness”.\nThe Monuments exhibit offers a huge range of styles and approaches that engage with the history of white supremacy, from Andres Serrano’s intimate 1990 photographs of Ku Klux Klan members, to a short film by Julie Dash featuring opera singer Davóne Tines, to Nona Faustine’s gripping series of self-portraits as a Black woman standing at key sites of the slave trade in New York City.\nIn one gallery, a gigantic pair of Confederate statues from Baltimore stands next to a sculpture from Hank Willis Thomas: an upright Dodge Charger painted like the “General Lee”, the Confederate-themed car that appeared in the 80s television comedy The Dukes of Hazzard.\nIn another, Kahlil Robert Irving, a young artist who works in St Louis, offers a meticulous bronze replica of the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, where protests erupted after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer in 2014.\nOne of the most powerful rooms features Jon Henry’s series of photographs of Black mothers cradling their still-living sons as if they were already dead. Across from Henry’s photographs, which were taken in neighborhoods across the country in years marked by police killings of Black men and boys, is a 1917 sculpture of a larger-than-life white woman cradling a Confederate soldier, which was sponsored in part by the Daughters of the Confederacy, a political group that still has active chapters.\nBetween those works is Karon Davis’s sculpture of her son, Moses, holding a tiny sculpture of a Confederate general by the tail of his horse. One of the inspirations for Descendants was Davis being told that her own Black family is descended from a Confederate general and enslaver, John Hunt Morgan.\nAs of 2024, four out of five Confederate monuments in the United States remain in public spaces, according to Monument Lab, a non-profit that published a 2021 audit of nearly 50,000 public monuments in the US.\nCollecting Confederate monuments\nThe idea for the Monuments exhibit started eight years ago, in the fall of 2017, just months after the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, said Hamza Walker, the Brick curator. He and his collaborators began approaching cities that were taking down their Confederate monuments about acquiring them for an art exhibit. In the first few years, this work went slowly, he said: only 35 or 40 Confederate statues had come down.\nThen came the Black Lives Matter uprisings of 2020, sparked by the cell phone recording of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which resulted in another 150 US statues being removed, Hamza Walker said. In England, protesters toppled a monument to British enslaver Edward Colston and dumped it into the sea.\nWalker said the exhibit organizers ultimately sent out 68 requests to obtain decommissioned Confederate monuments across the US, and heard back from about two dozen locations.\nOf all the monuments Walker’s group was able to obtain, Charlottesville’s Lee and Jackson statues are perhaps the most charged – symbolic not only of historic violence, but of very recent white supremacist attacks.\nLike many Confederate monuments, Charlottesville’s stately Beaux Arts sculptures of Jackson and Lee were not actually products of the post-civil war mourning, but were erected a half century later, at the height of Jim Crow segregation in the south, when Black citizens were blocked from voting or serving in government, and romanticized images of Confederate leaders were created as enduring symbols of white political power.\nThe land where Jackson’s statue was erected in 1921 had once been a majority Black and mixed-race neighborhood that the city razed, replacing it with a whites-only park.\nKara Walker said her title for the remade sculpture, Unmanned Drone, plays in part on the idea of “the sculpture in its original form as a weapon of Jim Crow”.\nIn 2016, a local Charlottesville high school student, Zyahna Bryant, started a petition calling on the city government to remove the Lee statue standing in one of the city’s manicured greens. When the city government voted in favor of removing it in 2017, a range of white nationalist and neo-Nazi activists seized on the small-town controversy as a rallying point, staging months of pro-Confederate monument demonstrations and provocations that terrorized local residents.\nAt the Unite the Right rally in August 2017, a self-described neo-Nazi rammed a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, leaving many people injured and 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead. For months afterwards, the city covered the Lee and Jackson statues with black tarps, in an eerie sign of mourning. Then a judge ordered the tarps removed.\nIn 2021, after years of legal battles, both statues were finally taken down from their pedestals and hauled away to storage, and Charlottesville’s city council put out a request for proposals from organizations interested in obtaining the old monuments. Among the offers they received were one from a statuary park in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and one from a private citizen in Utopia, Texas. The Lee statue went to a local museum, the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center, which had proposed melting it down. The city council voted to give Jackson to Hamza Walker’s Los Angeles-based arts organization, with Kara Walker already on board to transform the work.\nRemaking an 8,900lb bronze monument came with plenty of logistical challenges. “I can give you a whole arsenal of cranes and lifts,” Hamza Walker said. The statue’s granite base weighed so many tons in total, he said, that it had to be transported on two flatbed trucks.\nTo help model how she wanted to transform the statue, Kara Walker worked with fabricator Mike Koller to make a 3D digital scan of the statue that allowed her to visualize potential configurations. “When you’re working in space with these heavy objects, it’s not just like picking it up and hovering and holding it,” she said.\nWhen the Jackson statue was finally transported to a foundry to be cut into its predetermined pieces, the 12ft 9in figure was too tall to fit through the foundry’s door, which was only about 11ft tall. That meant the fabricators were forced to cut off Jackson’s head to get the statue inside. That “wasn’t for dramatic effect”, curator Hamza Walker said. “But it had a dramatic effect, in a way that was unanticipated,” Kara Walker said. “You know, the violence of it.”\nAt the Brick, Unmanned Drone is accompanied by historical documents and a selection of Kara Walker’s early drawings and notes about the statue.\nThere are sketches of a Black woman riding backwards on Jackson’s horse, sometimes facing his boot, other times his body. There are scribbled questions: “Who heals a wound that continually opens itself?” “How many things can you do with bones?”\nThe final form of her Jackson statue is much simpler than the early drawings, distilled into a single bristling form.\nThe familiar bronze parts of the Confederate hero have been restructured “into something that wholly defies the original intention of the object”, said Andrea Douglas, the executive director of the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center. As an art historian who had lived and worked around the original statue for years, she called it “a little breathtaking”.",

    "body": "Alex Acosta, the former US attorney for the southern district of Florida who negotiated a plea deal in 2008 with Jeffrey Epstein, testified before the House oversight committee last month that going to trial would have been a “crapshoot” due to lack of cooperation from victims.\nIn a transcript of the six-hour interview released on Friday, Acosta, who later served in the first Trump administration as labor secretary, described the evidentiary hurdles a federal prosecution of Esptein would have faced, and told why his office turned the case over to Florida state prosecutors, which resulted in the disgraced financier pleading guilty to charges of soliciting sex from a minor.\n“Ultimately, the trial was a crapshoot, and we just wanted the guy to go to jail,” Acosta told members of the oversight panel.\nQuestions over the government’s non-prosecution agreement with Epstein have hung heavily over the scandal, generating speculation over the presence of larger forces at work.\nAcosta said it was the opinion of the government’s prosecution team that “a billionaire going to jail sends a strong signal to the community that this is not acceptable, that this is not right, that this cannot happen”.\nAcosta added that Epstein’s registering as a sex offender, as part of the non-prosecution agreement, “puts the world on notice. Whether the world listened or not we can put to one side, but it puts the world on notice that he was an offender and a sexual offender.”\nIf the 14-count federal case had gone to trial and the government had lost, Acosta argued, “that says that he got away with it, that you can do that more. And so we thought it was very, very important to send that signal, and that’s why … that’s one reason we favored the negotiated plea.”\nAcosta noted that the Palm Beach state attorney’s office had tried to encourage at least three victims to testify to a state grand jury – but only one had shown up. Acosta said federal prosecutors were uncertain that they could successfully prosecute Epstein given inconsistencies in some victims’ accounts.\n“Many victims refused to testify. Many victims had changing stories. All of us understood why they had changing stories, but they did. And defense counsel would have … cross-examination would have been withering,” he explained.\n“Many of them had issues in their background. They had MySpace pages, they had priors that would’ve been used against them by defense counsel. And that was a time when, in all candor, defense could be much, much tougher on victims on the stand.”\nBut in making a non-prosecution deal with Epstein – one that Maxwell later tried to use as a basis for an appeal against her 2021 sex-trafficking conviction and was rejected earlier this month by the supreme court – Acosta said prosecutors anticipated Florida authorities would ensure Epstein served all his 13-month sentence in jail.\n“We had an assurance that he would be in continuous confinement,” Acosta said. Later in the interview, he added: “Had we known that he was going to get work release, this would not have gone forward.”\nBut Acosta denied that Donald Trump, a friend of Epstein’s until a falling out over a property deal and a dispute over Epstein attempting to hire staff away from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago business, had ever been consulted about it. “He moved in circles that I did not move in,” he said.\nThe transcript release comes on the day that Prince Andrew agreed to give up his royal title of the Duke of York and other honors after it was revealed that he continued his friendship with Epstein after he said, in a 2019 TV interview, it had ended.\nThe new release also comes days ahead of a posthumously published memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked to Andrew by Epstein and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell on three occasions when she was 17.\nIn the interview with the oversight committee Acosta indicated that Epstein’s defense team, which included constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, came close to unethical.\n“Everyone is entitled to an aggressive defense,” Acosta said. “I don’t think the line was crossed. I don’t think there was misconduct … but it was distasteful. It did frustrate our attorneys.”\nEarlier, Robert Garcia, a Democrat on the oversight committee, released a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, demanding that she end her efforts to obstruct the panel’s investigation into Epstein.\nGarcia claimed that Bondi had refused to comply with a congressional subpoena to release the full Epstein files or co-operate with its investigation into “a corrupt quid-quo-pro between the DoJ and Ghislaine Maxwell”.\nGarcia said the “the ongoing refusal” to provide the committee with information “demonstrates the Trump administration’s contempt for providing transparency to the American people about Epstein’s crimes”.",

They’re managing and handling a very important strategic asset for us.”\nThe NNSA, which operates as part of the department of energy, does not directly control operational nuclear weapons – a Pentagon responsibility – but plays a strategic role in keeping warheads secure and functional without conducting explosive tests. The agency also runs non-proliferation programs aimed at preventing nuclear materials from reaching hostile nations or terrorist organizations.\nAround 1,400 NNSA employees will be furloughed without pay starting on Monday, leaving only 375 staff members designated as essential to continue working, according to an agency notice obtained by Politico. A department of energy spokesperson confirmed the approximate workforce numbers.\nThe spokesperson also said that NNSA’s office of secure transportation, which is responsible for transporting government-owned nuclear material across the country, is funded through 27 October, and added that Chris Wright, the energy secretary, will be at the NNSA site in Las Vegas on Monday to “further discuss the impacts of the shutdown on America’s nuclear deterrent”.\nUnder the agency’s 2025 contingency protocols in the event of a shutdown, the skeleton crew on duty will focus exclusively on hyperspecific safety operations: monitoring nuclear materials, maintaining unique equipment, ensuring reactor safety for navy vessels, and continuing international nonproliferation work it deems essential for security.\nBut most scientific research, stockpile maintenance, and global security programs will be suspended, potentially creating delays in sensitive national defense projects that need rigid and consistent oversight.\nThe current impasse has now become the longest complete government-wide shutdown in US history, surpassing a 16-day funding lapse in 2013. Previous lengthier shutdowns affected only portions of the federal government.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson blamed Senate Democrats for the crisis, saying earlier this week the country is “barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history, unless Democrats drop their demands”. Republican leaders are also now worried about potential airport disruptions during the upcoming Thanksgiving travel period if the stalemate continues.\nHundreds of thousands of federal employees, including congressional and agency staffers, remain either furloughed or working without pay.",

Within minutes, dozens of troopers equipped with helmets and batons moved in to push the crowd back. Officers tackled and dragged several individuals. Much of the clash was captured on video and posted to social media.\nAt one point, protesters tried to intervene as a fellow demonstrator was detained. Later in the day, groups blew whistles at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents entering and leaving the facility.\nAs arrests took place, chants of: “Who do you protect?” echoed through the crowd during tense exchanges with police, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.\nProtester and congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh voiced frustration over the restrictions. “A free speech zone implies that everywhere else is not a free speech zone,” she told the Associated Press. Abughazaleh said she was struck in the face with a baton and witnessed an officer push a woman to the ground.\nThe Broadview facility has been the scene of recurring unrest in recent weeks. Federal agents have previously used teargas and other chemical agents on protesters and journalists. Illinois state police reported that some participants blocked a nearby street on Friday and refused to move to the authorized protest area.\nLocal officials have faced mounting challenges managing hundreds of demonstrators who gather outside the detention center, mainly on Fridays and Sundays. Federal agents have repeatedly used chemical irritants and so-called “less-lethal” rounds to disperse crowds.\nProtests began around 8am Friday, appearing to violate the recent directive of Broadview’s mayor, Katrina Thompson, limiting demonstrations to the hours between 9am and 6pm.\nThompson has been outspoken in her criticism of federal agents’ conduct, saying, “This is not Putin’s Russia,” and calling on federal officials to cooperate with ongoing criminal investigations.\nOn Monday, Thompson reduced the size of the designated protest area, an arrangement previously coordinated with state and county law enforcement, citing that last week’s demonstrations “degenerated into chaos” and disrupted the village’s 8,000 residents.\nFriday’s clash followed a court order issued a day earlier requiring federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations, after multiple incidents involving pepper balls, smoke grenades and teargas against protesters and local police.\nJB Pritzker, Illinois’s governor, who has criticized the deployment of federal forces to the state, praised the ruling.\n“The idea that there’s any justification for people tossing teargas in the context of people’s protests, I think the judge reacted to that properly by ordering that now the federal agents are required to have body cameras on them because they clearly lie about what goes on,” Pritzker said.\nThe Trump administration targeted Chicago with federal law enforcement in August, falsely claiming there had been a rise in crime in the city in recent years. Since then, there have been reports of Ice increasingly aggressive enforcement in communities, including helicopters hovering over apartment raids.",

    "body": "Faculty at the University of Texas at Austin fear entire academic departments may be on the chopping block after the university quietly appointed a committee charged with studying the restructuring of its liberal arts programs.\nThe university – the largest in the public University of Texas system – has not made any announcements about cuts or restructuring, but faculty there have learned the committee was established earlier this semester and tasked with a review that they believe is focused on ethnic and regional disciplines such as African and African diaspora studies, Mexican American and Latina/o studies, as well as women’s and gender studies.\nThe university did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment and faculty who asked administrators about the committee said they have received no clear answers. On Thursday, UT Austin also announced a taskforce to conduct a “thorough review” of the university’s core curriculum – a set of required courses taken by all students – “to better fulfill the purpose of this curriculum and identify gaps in quality, rigor, or intellectual cohesion”, the university’s president wrote in an email.\nThe taskforce is made up of 18 professors – none from the departments where cuts are feared. Students have circulated an image in private emails and chats mocking the fact that almost all faculty on it are white.\n“We’re hearing bits and pieces,” said Julie Minich, a professor in the English and Mexican American and Latina/o studies departments at UT Austin. “We’re hearing that the dean appointed a restructuring committee. We’re hearing rumors about who’s on it. And then we’re trying to read the tea leaves.”\nConcerns escalated after a new state law went into effect on 1 September, disbanding the public university system’s long-established faculty senates and giving university administrators near-absolute control over university governance matters. While university senates hold advisory roles at most schools, they are generally a primary outlet for faculty to engage in decisions concerning the university.\nAs the law kicked in, UT Austin’s new president – the first to be appointed without faculty input – announced the establishment of a 12-person faculty advisory board entirely selected by him and “charged with advising on institutional matters and focusing on the best interests of the entire University”.\nWhile UT Austin leaders have said little about their plans for the university’s future, the new provost, William Inboden, recently outlined his vision in a 7,000-word manifesto published in National Affairs, a rightwing magazine. In the essay, he laments the crisis of “legitimacy and trust” in US higher education and universities’ “ideological imbalance”, in part blaming the “identity-studies framework” for them.\n“Too many American history courses present the American past as a litany of oppressions and hypocrisies, leaving students with an imbalanced view of the United States,” he wrote, repeating a position often invoked by conservatives, including Donald Trump, who have railed against universities as bastions of woke liberalism.\nInboden’s manifesto “really outlines his sense that the humanities and liberal arts are full of pathology and rot”, said Craig Campbell, an anthropology professor at UT Austin. “That’s what they’re going after.”\nHe added that the uncertainty had been a major distraction this semester. “It’s a horrible, horrible climate right now.”\n“We really took this article as an indication of hostility for our field,” echoed Minich, referring to Inboden’s essay. “The combination of the formation of this committee without any communication with the faculty and then this article published by the provost has really put a lot of people on edge.”\nEarlier this year, the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute also took aim at UT Austin. In a report titled “Are the ‘Studies’ Worth Studying?”, the conservative thinktank appears to foreshadow the targeting of the same departments faculty now fear are under threat.\n“The ‘Studies’ – e.g., ‘Women’s Studies,’ ‘Asian American Studies,’ ‘Critical Disability Studies,’ etc. – are activist rather than scholarly disciplines,” the report concludes, claiming that they are rife with “grade inflation”. “‘Low hanging-fruit’ remedies to grade inflation include eliminating low-rigor disciplines (such as the Studies).”\nMinich flatly rejected the report’s conclusions.\n“I would vigorously dispute any characterization of area studies or ethnic studies as ideologically engaged in the indoctrination of students,” she said. “My goal in the classroom is never to tell students what to think. It’s to give them tools for how to think about a complicated world, and the fact that I feel that I’m being prevented from doing that seems to me to be a real problem.”\nTexas – along with other Republican-led states like Florida and Ohio – has long led conservative efforts to reshape US higher education. The state’s legislators were among the first to weaken protections for tenured faculty and to eliminate diversity and inclusion initiatives. Last month, a controversy over “gender ideology” in the classroom led to the resignation of the president of Texas A&M University’s main campus.\nUT Austin scrapped its diversity initiatives and laid off about 60 staff working on related programs before Trump returned to office. It also closed its Multicultural Engagement Center and cancelled its traditional bilingual graduation ceremony for Spanish-speaking students.\nThe university was among the first institutions the Trump administration offered preferential access to federal funding in exchange for an overhaul of its policies to align with the administration’s agenda, an offer since extended to all universities in the country. The University of Virginia, MIT, Brown, the University of Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania have turned it down.\nUT Austin leaders have not yet responded to the president’s offer. Earlier this week, about 200 students made their opposition to it clear as they chanted “do not sign” in front of the administration’s main building.",

    "body": "“He who saves his country does not violate any law,” Donald Trump posted after beginning his second term – emboldened, perhaps, by the supreme court’s bombshell ruling on presidential immunity last year, which many say gave the office-holder the powers of a monarch.\nMillions of Americans are expected to push back against the president’s growing power at No Kings protests across the US on Saturday. The demonstrations come as former intelligence and national security officials warn that the country is sliding towards “competitive authoritarianism”, in which elections and courts survive but are systematically manipulated by the executive.\nThe justice system is not a nice addition to democracy but a core, constitutive element of it. This is now imperilled not only by Mr Trump’s stacking of the judiciary, pardoning of January 6 rioters who assaulted police, and ignoring of rulings that restrain the executive’s actions, but also by its abuse for political ends. The US is descending from rule of law towards rule by law: from law as the restraint upon the executive, applied without fear or favour, to law as its weapon.\nThursday saw the announcement of the prosecution of John Bolton – the third high-profile political target of Mr Trump within a month to be criminally charged. Letitia James, the New York attorney general who successfully sued Mr Trump for fraud, was indicted for alleged mortgage fraud; the former FBI director James Comey, under whose watch the bureau investigated Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, for an alleged false statement to Congress. Both deny all charges.\nMr Trump said the quiet part out loud in a social media post apparently published unintentionally, which urged Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to take legal action against Ms James, Mr Comey and the Democratic senator Adam Schiff: “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\nThe indictment of Mr Bolton for alleged mishandling of classified information – he denies the charges and drew parallels to Stalinist purges – is somewhat different. The other indictments followed the installation of a former personal lawyer for Mr Trump as prosecutor. This case was pursued under the Biden presidency and a career prosecutor signed off the charges.\nYet the administration shrugged when the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, shared details of planned military strikes with relatives and a journalist via a commercial messaging app. Mr Trump has repeatedly made plain his enmity for Mr Bolton, a former national security adviser turned outspoken critic, including by axing his security detail. He regularly calls for the jailing of opponents, including judges who obstruct his administration, as well as JB Pritzker, governor of Illinois, and Brandon Johnson, Chicago’s mayor, after the Democrats opposed the deployment of troops to the city.\nMr Trump has sold personal vindictiveness as political righteousness, campaigning with the words “I am your retribution”. He has been remarkably successful. In a recent survey, a third of Republicans backed the idea that American citizens who oppose the president should be deported.\nThe administration has already presented Saturday’s protests as a threat to order. Mr Trump’s political triumph has been built on invoking crisis to distract from or justify the erasure of democratic safeguards. This is an old playbook, and no less frightening for its familiarity. It is the weaponising of a fundamental part of US democracy that is the real emergency.",

    "body": "Donald Trump had better hope the members of the Nobel committee are not paying attention to what’s happening inside the United States. If they did take a look, they’d notice a jarring pattern. While the US president likes to play the peacemaker abroad, at home he is Trump, bringer of war.\nIt’s easy for the first fact to conceal, or divert our attention away from, the second. This week was a case in point. It began with Trump travelling to Israel, where he was hailed as a latter-day Cyrus, a mighty ruler whose name would be spoken of for millennia to come, the man who had brokered what he himself boasts is an “everlasting” peace.\nNever mind that Trump’s success, for which he certainly deserves some credit, was in pushing Hamas and Israel to agree a ceasefire and release of hostages and prisoners, a fragile arrangement that does not address, let alone solve, the underlying Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He presented it as a triumph of the ages and one more notch on his peacemaker’s bedpost, taking the tally of wars he claims to have ended to eight.\nIndeed, buoyed up by his success, he is having another go at the one he thought would be easy but which, to his irritation, has proved as complex as all the hated experts and deep state naysayers warned it would be: Russia’s war on Ukraine. On Thursday he announced his plan to meet yet again with Vladimir Putin, this time hosted by Viktor Orbán in Budapest (which has the happy side-benefit of trolling the EU).\nUnfazed by the failure of their last meeting in Alaska, and by his own failure ever to stand up to Putin, Trump clearly believes he has pacific momentum and that the healing magic his touch brought to Gaza will similarly unite Moscow and Kyiv.\nBut what undermines this new, Nobel-ready look of Trump’s is not only the absurd braggadocio, or even the confusion of the style and optics of peacemaking for the substance and hard graft it requires. It is the fact that he is fomenting war at home on his own citizens. I am not speaking metaphorically. Increasingly, serious analysts not prone to hyperbole are warning that Trump seems bent on provoking a second American civil war. The evidence is piling up.\nThe most obvious is Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of America’s cities. He claims that his original decisions to send in the National Guard to Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, Portland and Memphis were motivated solely by concern over crime. In his telling, these places were “overrun” by violence and local police needed his help. But that doesn’t stack up.\nThe data shows that most of the cities Trump has targeted have lower rates of violent crime than other large cities that have remained untouched. (Of the 10 major US cities with the biggest crime problems, Trump has hit only one: Memphis.) So why would Trump be sending in the troops?\nOne explanation is that he lives in such a closed filter bubble, his sources of information so narrow, that he is not in possession of the actual facts. Earlier this month, he described Portland, Oregon as a “burning hellhole”, adding that “You see fires all over the place. You see fights, and I mean just violence. It’s just so crazy.” The people of Portland – cycling or taking their kids to the park, as normal – were bemused. It seemed Trump had been watching Fox News, confusing footage from the riots of 2020 with today.\nBut none of this is a mistake. For what the likes of Chicago, LA and Portland have in common is not imagined rates of runaway crime but something that angers Trump much more: they are Democrat-run cities in Democrat-led states. (The giveaway is that Cleveland, Ohio and Kansas City, Missouri have higher rates of violent crime but are under Republican governors. So they have been left alone.)\nThis is a political act by Trump, designed to intimidate potential strongholds of opposition. Some critics suspect the administration hopes to provoke violence from those whose cities now feel like occupied territory. Perhaps a riot or an attack on the military that can be instantly spun, as the assassination of Charlie Kirk was, as an act of leftist terrorism that merits a further crackdown, seizure of emergency powers or suspension of liberties.\nOthers believe this is about normalising the presence of troops on the streets before next year’s midterm elections, a crucial contest that could see Republicans lose the House of Representatives, handing Democrats a serious check on Trump’s power. In this view, troops will be in place either to scare away minorities and others who might usually vote for the Democratic party, or for the battle after polling day, to enforce an attempt by the White House to void results that don’t go their way. Think of a re-run of 6 January 2021 – except this time with the armed forces on hand to ensure Trump’s will is done.\nThe obvious objection to this scenario is that the US military would surely refuse to let itself be used as a partisan political instrument. But that is to miss what Trump and Pete Hegseth – now rebranded not as secretary of defence, but as secretary of war – are doing to the US military. Witness last month’s jawdropping meeting of hundreds of top US admirals and generals, gathered from across the globe. Trump could not have been clearer, instructing them that they now faced an “enemy from within”, that their job was to deal with “civil disturbances” and that they should regard America’s “dangerous cities as training grounds”. At one point, Hegseth said that any officer who disagreed with the new, Trumpian conception of the US military should “do the honorable thing and resign”.\nAll of this comes in the context of a president who is nakedly using the justice system to punish his critics – note the indictment issued on Thursday against his former national security adviser John Bolton – whose chief adviser called the Democratic party a “domestic extremist organisation” even before the Kirk killing; that sends masked agents to snatch people, including US citizens, off the streets; that is using the government shutdown to eliminate “Democrat agencies”, meaning those pockets of the independent civil service that might act as a restraint on presidential whim, while cutting funds to institutions, from the universities to public broadcasting, that might do the same; and that is imposing ideological orthodoxy on the entire federal bureaucracy, with the FBI’s firing of an employee who had displayed the pride flag only the latest example.\nTrump likes talking the peace talk when it comes to Palestinians and Israelis or Russians and Ukrainians. But inside the US, where red meets blue, he does not see a contest between rivals but rather a conflict with an enemy he admits he hates – one that has to be fought by any means necessary, even to the very end.\n-\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "body": "Why are we so obsessed with hair? Just a bunch of fibers sprouting out of your skin, yet we make a massive fuss over it. Those with it, flaunt it. News anchors, fashion models, that damned Jeremy Allen White. Boy, does he love to show off. His hair should be nominated for an Emmy, just on thickness alone. What did he do to deserve that floppy mess on top of his head? I thought this country was a meritocracy? Nope. He’s obviously benefited from a family history of thick locks.\nCall me greedy if you must, but I don’t just want some hair – the sad remnants of a life in decline – I want a lot of hair. I want so much hair that I have to employ a live-in barber to trim me up twice a day just to keep it all from consuming my entire face. I want people in the streets screaming at the top of their lungs. “Look at that hair! The guy under it isn’t so bad, either!”\nI wouldn’t dare classify myself as bald, though. Thinning? Sure. Most people are not tall enough to see my bald spot, nor can they clearly see the nearly imperceptible retreat of my hairline. Unless they spend even a second comparing photos of me today to my Guardian author photo, which is from nine years ago. You might not notice, but I do. I have to carve out an extra 20 minutes every morning just to fuss over my bald spot. I summon what little hope I have left to comb and fluff the thin area at the top of my head, praying I can figure out the cheat code for hiding my darkest shame. Eventually, I surrender – the rage over my metaphorical windmill subsiding as I accept reality.\nUnfortunately, for some, being angry and indignant is a prominent part of their personality. Donald Trump’s latest tirade is, at its core, about his own battle with the ravages of time. Literally and figuratively. Once again, Trump has come face to face with what he actually looks like, which would terrify and enrage just about anyone. When he’s not obsessing over the afterlife, Trump spends an inordinate amount of time kvetching about his appearance. First, it was a painting that made him look like a time-traveling Tudor monarch who just got kicked out of a Sizzler buffet line. Now, he’s directed his ire at Time magazine, which put him on the cover in tribute to his efforts to broker peace in Gaza. The headline, “His Triumph”, cements the fawningly positive positioning.\nThe staff at Time probably thought they were going to get a gentle kiss on the cheek from Daddy (the owner of Time is the billionaire Marc Benioff, who has recently come out as a Trump supporter), but instead they received a digital tongue lashing for the cover photo – shot from underneath, Trump’s obscene neck crease filling the frame. At the top of the cover, Trump’s signature metallic yellow wave of hair looks thin and wispy, like someone dumped a handful of dry angel hair pasta on his head as a college prank.\nAs is his right as an American with the power of free speech as enshrined in our constitution, Trump used Truth Social to register his displeasure. “They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one. Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”\nMaybe Ice got a hold of his hair and refuses to disclose its whereabouts. As for the crown, you’d think he’d appreciate the honor, but gratitude is not a Maga virtue. I understand the thing about the angles, though. Who wants to be photographed from underneath besides models for an obscure fetish blog and professional wrestlers?\nI recognize that the natural first reaction to realizing you’re losing your hair is to be angry about it. Surely, it must be someone else’s fault. It’s the angles or the lighting. The reality is what it is, though, and it’s better to live in the world than to imagine it as something else. The man is nearly 80. Hair loss at that age seems inevitable, unless you’re an obscure Kennedy cousin or a member of the Rolling Stones. But there have never been more ways to solve the problem of thinning hair.\nThere are transplant procedures, the tried-and-true Rogaine method, spraying Krylon paint on yourself and praying the temperature doesn’t rise above 70F, and various magical pills that supposedly offer painless hair regrowth. I was watching the Major League Baseball playoffs recently, which is a treasure trove of ads for bizarre medical treatments, alcoholic beverages and sitcoms no one watches. One of the ads was for a product called Nutrafol, which is a pill that promises to regrow hair “from within” – not exactly where I want hair to grow. I’m not looking to grow an afro in my colon, so maybe they should rethink their marketing strategy.\nThe Nutrafol website looks like you should be able to order Sweetgreen from it – bland fonts, tasteful product shots, and random photos of people looking up to the sky like a 747 is about to crash into their barn. The pills contain a variety of natural-sounding ingredients like “horsetail” (horses have beautiful hair!), kelp (not much hair down in the ocean, but sure), and something called “tocotrienol complex”, which sounds like the name of a synth band from the late 1980s.\nI can’t in good conscience endorse such a product in my position as a credible journalist, but you know who can? The president of the United States. The Trump administration has already vaporized most norms and rules of decorum for the highest office in the land, so why not reach a little bit deeper into our collective pockets for some more loose change? Spin this negative into a positive and let Trump – who has already successfully sold his fans hats, steaks, fake college educations, wine and an imploding economy – endorse a pill for bald guys. From pain comes profit. What’s more American than that?\n-\nDave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist",

    "body": "Two years of death and destruction in Gaza ended once Israel and Hamas signed off on Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan. A ceasefire is in place. Humanitarian trucks have begun to roll in. Hostages and prisoners are being exchanged. Israel has begun a first-phase pullback from the territories it controls, and under Trump’s plan its troops will eventually be deployed in a buffer zone along Gaza’s land border.\nGiven these developments – all part of the opening phase – dismissing the momentous changes in Gaza is to deny reality. There have already been disputes over the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, but there are unresolved longer-term problems that could derail the ceasefire and imperil the rest of the Trump plan.\nOne concerns Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza. Even after the IDF’s first pullback, it will control more than half of the territory, including the Philadelphi corridor adjacent to Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has insisted it must relinquish. The next withdrawal is supposed to reduce Israel’s military presence in Gaza to 40%, followed by another that cuts it to 15%.\nDisputes over the extent and pace of the IDF’s withdrawals could jeopardise the ceasefire. The plan heightens this risk by failing to specify a timeline for the IDF’s remaining disengagements – or who will ensure their implementation, and how.\nThese aren’t trivial omissions. Hamas had long insisted that Israel must leave all of Gaza as part of any ceasefire deal. Its negotiators settled for less because of intense pressure from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar, enlisted by Trump for that purpose.\nIf Israel balks at additional withdrawals, Hamas can’t count on Trump to act as enforcer. It doubtless remembers that in March Israel walked away from the multi-stage 15 January agreement, which the US supported, once it came time to negotiate a timetable for the departure of its troops – even though hostage releases remained incomplete. The White House did nothing in response, not even after Israel also imposed a three-month blockade on aid deliveries.\nMore recently, Hamas watched Benjamin Netanyahu ignore Trump’s call earlier this month for Israel to halt its bombing, issued after Hamas’s written response to his plan convinced him that its leaders were prepared for peace. Again, the US stood by as Israel continued its offensive in Gaza City, killing dozens of its inhabitants, including children, within a day of Trump’s appeal.\nThe Trump plan prohibits Israel’s occupation or annexation of Gaza. That proviso doesn’t, however, rule out an open-ended Israeli military presence – portrayed as temporary and justified by allegations that Hamas hasn’t met its disarmament obligations. But the more Hamas believes that Israel is seeking to delay its departure, the more likely it is to stall on disarmament.\nThough the plan calls on Hamas to surrender its weaponry and permit the destruction of its underground tunnel network and weapons production centres, it lacks monitoring and verification provisions.\nThis omission could give Israel leeway to delay withdrawing troops by citing Hamas’s non-compliance and provide Hamas room to deny the charge. How will the veracity of Israel’s claims and Hamas’s rebuttals be verified? How will Hamas’s obligations be enforced, and by whom?\nGiven the complete lack of trust between Hamas and Israel, the plan’s vagueness makes disputes over disarmament all but inevitable – and potentially fatal to the ceasefire.\nThis isn’t a far-fetched scenario. Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the US, said recently that Israel would remain in Gaza until Hamas disarms fully, and shortly after his cabinet approved the ceasefire plan, Netanyahu vowed to resume the war if Gaza wasn’t “demilitarised”. What’s more, Israel has not promised a total military withdrawal even if those conditions are met.\nHamas, for its part, fears being left without means to resist if it disarms. It also worries that the IDF will then have greater freedom to remain in parts of Gaza that lie beyond the buffer zone or to demand that the zone extend deeper into Gaza. Tellingly, Hamas’s statement accepting the ceasefire did not mention disarmament. Moreover, on Saturday, one of its senior officials stated that, “The demand that we hand over our weapons is not up for negotiation,” adding that disarmament was “out of the question”.\nAnother problem with the Trump plan is the international stabilisation force (ISF), which it says will be composed of troops from regional states and other Muslim countries, and will assume responsibility for Gaza’s security after the IDF hands over the areas it leaves. The plan offers no details on the size of this peacekeeping force, the scope of its responsibilities and the means it will use to contain disorder, whether from clashes between Hamas and Israel or violence pitting Hamas against armed groups (some rival clans, others backed by Israel), something that has already occurred. Plus, though a few states have signalled their interest, none has yet committed to providing troops for the ISF – perhaps because of these looming dangers.\nAnd assuming that Israel will countenance a robust peacekeeping force in Gaza – where it has acted without constraint since seizing the territory during the 1967 six-day war – is a leap of faith. Should Israel continue to intervene in Gaza, citing threats to its security, it’s hard to imagine the ISF resisting, particularly if the IDF goes further and reoccupies parts of the territory.\nGaza’s ceasefire isn’t fated to fail, but its foundation is fragile. If it cracks, the rest of the Trump plan – continued aid deliveries, the deployment of peacekeepers, a postwar governance structure and economic reconstruction – will remain aspirational. Worse, Gaza could revert to a killing field.\n-\nRajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "body": "“They have a ‘Hate America’ rally that’s scheduled for October 18 on the National Mall,” the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said on Fox News on Friday. “It’s all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people. They’re all coming out.”\nThe Republican Minnesota congressman Tom Emmer said the party’s “terrorist wing” was holding the “Hate America” rally. “Democrats want to keep the government shut down to show all those people that are going to come here and express their hatred towards this country that they’re fighting President Trump,” said the House majority leader, Steve Scalise. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, embellished the story on Fox, referring to the demonstrations’ “paid protesters” and adding: “It begs the question who’s funding it.”\nThese people are, of course, slandering the second round of No Kings marches, following those on 14 June, which dwarfed Trump’s pitiful birthday party military parade. This time the events – more than 2,500 of them, according to organizers, planned for every state – promise to be even larger.\nTrump’s allies are trying to overwrite the patriotic, historically resonant words “No Kings” with insinuations of treasonous violence.\nEveryone participating in the protests must prove them wrong. Nonviolence, both rigorously disciplined and open-hearted, must define 18 October.\nThe stakes are bigger than anything that happens tomorrow. Because these politicians are not just talking. This smear campaign is one skirmish in the all-fronts war on a vaguely defined leftwing entity the administration calls “antifa”. This war – declared in the 25 September national security presidential memorandum, Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence – is not just supported by propaganda. Disinformation is its essence.\nThe national security reporter Ken Klippenstein published a restricted-circulation FBI/homeland security bulletin on “domestic violence extremists” (DVE), released on 1 October, that links attacks on Ice buildings to peaceful anti-Ice demonstrations. Since June, it says, “small groups of threat actors, some of whom are DVEs, have leveraged large, lawful protests” in California and Oregon “to engage in violent activity” against Ice facilities and “violent confrontations with law enforcement”.\nLast week, at a White House “antifa roundtable”, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, claimed: “Antifa is just as sophisticated as MS-13, as [Tren de Aragua], as Isis, as Hezbollah, as Hamas, as all of them.” The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, thanked the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, “for getting to the bottom of these funding mechanisms and individuals who are perpetuating [sic] this violence on our American cities”.\nCommentators on the “Hate America” blitz, including some of the events’ organizers, have called it an attempt to silence dissent by scaring would-be marchers into staying home. My hunch is that diminishing the crowds is just half of the strategy. The other half is more pernicious. With Ice and the military already dispatched to terrorize Black and blue cities, such language may inspire civilian paramilitaries – many of them armed, organized and trained – to go into the streets and cause mayhem.\nThese militias took action on 6 January 2021. They are itching for another opportunity to attack the “enemy within”, and they don’t need explicit orders to do so. “Hate America” is the phrase that could impel them to act.\nIn larger cities like New York and San Francisco, the marchers will far outnumber any counter-protesters. In the cities occupied by federal troops, where local police don’t relish the optics of teargas wafting through crowds of elderly baby boomers and babies in strollers, there’s no guarantee the feds will restrain themselves. The national guard and Ice have already gassed and pepper-sprayed demonstrators apparently doing nothing more aggressive than standing around and yelling, or, like the Chicago pastor shot in the head with a pepper ball canister, nothing aggressive at all.\nEnter the freelance enforcers. And it’s in the red states, where gun laws are lax and progressives constitute a small minority, that the odds of aggression and goading to aggression by Maga loyalists are highest.\nMaga wants nothing more than violence at the marches. Any violent clash, no matter who starts it, will be a green light to the administration to step up the policing crackdown, including on Saturday. The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has been tossing around the word “insurrection” to describe peaceful opposition to the Trump agenda. The president could use anything construable as chaos to invoke the Insurrection Act.\nNonviolence is not the same as passivity; it’s the antithesis of surrender. It is not mild, not even friendly. Contradictory as it sounds, steadfast nonviolent resistance against a violent state is the most righteous expression of rage.\nIt’s reassuring that the national non-profit Indivisible, which is also reportedly in Trump’s sights, is among the groups at the helm of the No Kings events. Since its founding in 2016, the organization has been committed to nonviolence. “We reject all forms of political violence and intimidation, no matter the source or the target,” reads its website. “That’s not just a moral stance – it’s a strategic one. Movements that create lasting change do so by building trust, forging solidarity and demonstrating discipline, even in the face of threats or attacks.”\nAlmost all of the 250 partner organizations that appear on NoKings.org are as politically vanilla as progressives can get: the ACLU, Faithful America, the Sierra Club, the Feminist Majority.\nAlert to the administration’s provocations, Indivisible provides detailed information on running legal, safe and peaceful events. “We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values,” it says. Weapons of any kind are always prohibited.\nThe good news is that nonviolence is the 21st-century US left’s default behavior. With few exceptions, it is not just nonviolent; it is anti-violence. Prison abolition, disarmament, the feminist politics of care, pacifism – these are leftwing movements. By contrast, extreme-right causes, institutions and tropes – gun rights, the carceral state, the “warrior ethos” – spell out a politics of coercion, cruelty and punishment.\nOn 18 October, tens of millions of people in the streets, peacefully exercising the democratic rights that the Trump regime is laboring to eliminate, will give the lie to Maga’s hallucinatory network of bomb-throwing traitors. No Kings will show America who the real haters are.\n-\nJudith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books. Her Substack is Today in Fascism",

To them, inconvenient evidence is by definition “bias”. His followers and those who fear his fist are falling into line: media, universities and that infamous regiment of tech zillionaires who stood right behind him on inauguration day. The day after Trump’s election victory was certified by an electoral vote tally in Congress, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg announced that, starting with the US, the company would “get rid of factcheckers and replace them with community notes similar to X”.\nA similar hammer blow has just struck Full Fact, the exceptionally valuable UK factchecker whose word is a gold standard for honesty. Google has pulled its £1m funding. Along with the possible ending of sizeable donations from Meta, the charity tells me this amounts to a loss of a third of its funding.\nFull Fact’s CEO, Chris Morris, says: “We think Google’s decisions, and those of other big US tech companies, are influenced by the perceived need to please the current US administration, feeding a harmful new narrative that attacks factchecking and all it stands for. Verifiable facts matter and the big internet companies have responsibilities when it comes to curtailing the spread of harmful misinformation.” Morris pioneered the BBC’s reality check, now called BBC Verify, charting the BBC’s perilous course through the Brexit and pandemic years. As a member of the European governance body of the European Fact-Checking Standards Network, Full Fact has shared its falsehood-finding AI tool with factcheckers in more than 40 countries.\nThe “community notes” system that replaces factchecking at Google, Meta and X abandons a notion of objective truth verified by science or evidence. Instead, it crowdsources any comments on a piece of content and the algorithm finds a “consensus”: the Earth could be flat if most people say so.\nGoogle recently dropped its ClaimReview, a tagging system that lets search engines, apps and social media platforms find fact checks and display them with the original factual error: Google used to boast it reached billions of users. When I asked why it had gone, a spokesperson directed me to the company’s statement that it is “simplifying search results”, and pointed out that it also continues to offer dedicated tools such as Fact Check Explorer, “for people who specifically want to explore claims that have been reviewed”.\nThe anti-fact ideology was proclaimed in JD Vance’s full-throated assault on Europe in February in Munich, when he warned that European democracy was at risk from the enemy within. (Many might identify a different enemy.) He claimed that Joe Biden’s administration “threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation”. He described “misinformation” as an “ugly Soviet-era word” and suggested anyone using it doesn’t like the idea that “somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion”.\nVance seems to think factchecking is censorship. Full Fact responds that it “doesn’t restrict debate: it strengthens it by grounding it in truth”. The checkers never ask to remove or censor content from the internet. In its now at-risk partnership with Meta, it would simply attach a label to a post suggesting that readers might want to see what Full Fact says about it before sharing it further. Among the things Full Fact checks are harmful financial scams, false and misleading medical information that damages people’s health, and online videos that encourage suicidal thoughts among teenagers.\nThe word “misinformation” is now all but banned among any in the US relying on government approval: the US National Science Foundation, for instance, terminated grants worth many millions it had awarded to researchers studying misinformation. But as Full Fact says, “debating the language risks missing the real issue: our online information environment is under greater threat than ever before.” This dispute is also at the heart of debate on the UK’s Online Safety Act, designed to protect children and others from the worst harms. Nigel Farage pledged to abolish it on his trip to the US Congress last month where he said of UK free speech: “At what point did we become North Korea?”\nA long list of distinguished institutional and charitable funders back Full Fact. It is free to use and, like the Guardian, relies on individual supporters, who relish, as I do, avalanches of daily checks. Here’s a sample: No, the UK hasn’t pledged £40bn to Gaza’s reconstruction. No, James Cleverly didn’t (quite) say about China what Keir Starmer claimed he did in PMQs. No, police did not say immigrants are eating swans. No, immigration didn’t increase four-fold under the Tories, but it doubled. There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that London is under sharia law. A picture of beautiful Epping mums protesting in pink against an asylum hotel is an AI fake (but there were mums there). Its rolling government tracker is compelling: 59 out of 86 pledges happened or are in progress.\nIn her conference speech, Kemi Badenoch quoted Margaret Thatcher claiming that “the facts of life are conservative”, a dangerous line of thought when JD Vance seems to believe that facts belong to Trump. The critical value of independent checkers is to hold on to the truth that facts belong to no one. Right here, this is one of the Enlightenment’s frontlines against the gathering storms of unreason.\n-\nPolly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

    "body": "“The security blanket is covering us, but maybe we have a foot out in the cold.” That was the typically colourful warning from the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, this week to its gathering of finance ministers in Washington.\nAt its spring meetings in April, the IMF said the erratic trade policies emanating from the White House, half a mile away from its glass and steel HQ, amounted to a “major negative shock” for the global economy.\nSince then, experts’ worst fears have not materialised – global growth has held up; frantic negotiations, agile manufacturers and new trading links have prevented supply chains collapsing.\nBut the US economy has been cushioned against the full effects of the trade shift by the AI mega-boom – and the IMF issued a clear warning this week that it may not last.\nIn its Global Financial Stability Report, published on Tuesday, the IMF said markets appeared “complacent”, given the policy tumult of the past few months. It highlighted three reasons to be anxious: overstretched valuations for tech stocks; volatility in government bond markets as they absorb fast-growing debts; and risks in the burgeoning private credit sector.\nGeorgieva said it was this last worry, in particular, that exercised her. Since bank regulation was tightened in the wake of the catastrophic global financial crisis of 2008, other less heavily scrutinised non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), such as investment firms, have piled into the lending business.\nThe IMF frets that this huge “shadow bank” sector could unleash global chaos if loans start to go bad – particularly since many of the firms involved are funded via borrowing from mainstream banks.\n“Adverse developments at these institutions – such as downgrades or falling collateral values – could significantly affect banks’ capital ratios,” it said. In total, it found banks in the US and Europe have $4.5trn of exposure to NBFIs.\nThe recent collapse of the US car parts supplier First Brands and the sub-prime auto lender Tricolor, which had relied heavily on complex private credit financing, were regarded by some market veterans – including JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon – as a sign that more problems may be in store. “I probably shouldn’t say this but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more,” he told an analyst call this week.\nWithin days, market fears had turned to a pair of shaky regional banks – Western Alliance and Zions Bank – and the sell-off continued into Friday.\nThe Trump administration, not a fan of financial regulation, appears relaxed about the issue, and more concerned with hammering China for its perceived unfair industrial and trade policies.\nWashington is expected to use its chair status among the G20 group of countries next year to press for more international action to curb “imbalances” such as Beijing’s persistent trade surpluses – with the IMF playing a role in policing member countries’ policies.\nIn DC this week, though, it was the risks of more “cockroaches” emerging from the vast and globally connected US financial system that were exercising policymakers: especially veterans of the global financial crisis in 2008.\nAsked about the issue of private credit at her press conference on Thursday, Georgieva said: “We are asking the question, what should be done to have more oversight and a better view of what is happening there?” She added that the question “keeps me awake every so often at night”.\nFor Rachel Reeves, the whirl of meetings in the US capital was a welcome reminder that the UK is far from alone in facing pressures on tax and spend, skittish bond markets – and tariff chaos. The British chancellor’s energetic Canadian counterpart, François-Philippe Champagne, with whom she has struck up a friendship, also has a tough budget to land next month, as Mark Carney’s administration comes to terms with a new, harsher relationship with its neighbour to the south.\nAnd such is the political instability in France – driven by financial pressures – that Reeves would have met her fifth French opposite number since Labour came to power last year, had Roland Lescure not stayed home to face the no-confidence votes in his prime minister.\nReeves used the trip to start rolling the pitch for tax increases at next month’s budget – including on the wealthy – and was rewarded with sliding yields on UK government bonds, known as gilts. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to prices, determines the interest rate the Treasury pays to borrow from investors.\nAnalysts said the gilt moves were also part of a “flight to safety” as markets fret about the credit sector, but Treasury strategists were gratified nevertheless.\nMeanwhile, as if to underscore the IMF’s concerns about a “sudden, sharp correction” in markets, its global financial stability review was launched at a press conference on Tuesday morning to a background of plunging stock prices. The fall was driven by Donald Trump upping the ante with China, posting a warning on his Truth Social platform that the US could cut off – of all things – cooking oil imports in retaliation for Beijing not buying its soya beans. Wall Street later rallied to close up on the day.\nAcross town that same day the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, was telling an audience of investors at the Institute for International Finance conference that “we have to watch very carefully just how stretched valuations are becoming”. With typical understatement, he added: “There are very different potential paths at the moment.”\nAs the IMF was careful to point out, any reversal in the AI boom would have real-world impacts, as tech companies backed away from the investment that is powering the construction of vast datacentres across the US and beyond – and driving a wave of tech imports from Asia. “The decline in aggregate investment could be rather sharp,” it warned.\nAnd a crisis, if it came, would hit a politically fragmented global economy, in which many governments’ finances are already stretched – with debt on course to hit its highest level since the aftermath of the second world war.\nThe temperatures in DC were unseasonably chilly this week, but the IMF did its best to warn policymakers, preoccupied with domestic struggles, of the mounting risk the global backdrop could cool sharply in the months to come.",

    "body": "Australia’s rich deposits of minerals used for green energy technologies and military hardware are increasingly prized, especially because of rising anxiety about China’s stranglehold on the global supply chain.\nThe timing of the latest US-China trade conflict could be good for Anthony Albanese, who will arrive at next week’s White House meeting armed with a valuable bargaining chip to negotiate with the deal-making president.\nThe Australian government is expected to offer the US access to a proposed critical minerals stockpile, amid wider attempts to shield the country from the worst of Trump’s trade strikes and secure the Aukus submarine deal .\nBut one expert thinks the critical minerals fight puts Australia in a “really compromised position”, caught between the competing priorities of its strongest strategic ally and its biggest trading partner.\nWhy is the US so desperate for critical minerals? Such critical minerals are the raw materials used in batteries, solar panels, wind turbines and military weapons.\nAustralia mines roughly half of the world’s lithium – a critical ingredient for EV batteries – and about a quarter of global bauxite, along with vast amounts of cobalt, manganese and a subset of critical minerals, known as rare earths . The overwhelming majority of these resources are exported overseas – mostly to China – rather than refined, processed and manufactured into finished products domestically.\nAustralia is not alone on that front.\nRare earths: how these critical minerals impact Australian industry and global politics – video China controls about 70% of rare earth mining and 90% of processing, allowing it to manipulate global supply and prices.\nThe US has been desperate to break China’s market domination to guarantee a secure supply of the essential materials.\nSusan Park, a University of Sydney professor who specialises in the global energy transition, says the US relies on China for more than half of the 50 resources on its critical minerals list, including metals used for aircraft, submarines and drones.\n“The US wants to maintain its military dominance, and so it’s realised that it absolutely has to get rare earth elements from somewhere that it does not believe it is in geo-strategic competition with,” she says.\nA close ally with an abundance of the raw materials, Australia is an obvious partner.\n“We know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,” said the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who is in Washington before Albanese’s visit.\nWhat can Australia offer - and would it actually help? Speculation about a possible critical minerals deal before the Trump-Albanese meeting has focused on granting the US access to the government’s proposed $1.2bn domestic stockpile.\nThe “critical minerals strategic reserve ” was announced in April, as part of Albanese’s immediate response to Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariffs , but details remain scarce while the government consults with industry on its design.\nA discussion brief circulated to industry stakeholders in recent weeks by the Department of Prime Minister & Cabinet (PM&C), seen by Guardian Australia, says the stockpile will “secure access to a small set of critical minerals with high strategic value for the reserve”.\nThe brief asks for suggestions on which minerals would be “suitable” for the reserve in the next two, five and 10 years, indicating decisions about the material to be stockpiled have yet to be made.\nGovernment and industry sources familiar with the design process expect investors from places such as the US and European Union would be able to access supplies.\nThe prospect of a taxpayer-backed “price floor” has been floated, a measure the US is also pursuing in response to Beijing’s latest export controls.\nThe US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, also suggested the US could take direct stakes in rare earth ventures, with the Australian reporting that could include Australian projects.\nThe US appetite for critical minerals presents a potential boon for Australia, but Park says the latest Washington-Beijing conflict put the government in a “really compromised position”, given China is Australia’s largest trading partner, including for critical minerals.\nAbout 90% of Australia’s overall lithium exports – the value of which is expected to reach $8.2bn in 2030 – are shipped to China.\nAsked if the government was concerned China could retaliate if Australia sided with the US – as has previously occurred – Chalmers said: “No, we engage with our major trading partners in good faith, and in Australia’s national economic interests.”\n“So it’s possible for us to engage on both of those fronts, but more than possible, it’s necessary and important that we do that,” Chalmers said.\nCould Maga become a sticking point? While the “dig-and-ship” of critical minerals is a lucrative trade, there is much greater value if the resources can be processed onshore, cutting China out of that step in the supply chain.\nAustralia’s so-called “downstream” processing capacity is limited, a concession made in PM&C’s brief about the proposed stockpile.\nThe government hopes to kickstart the industry with tax production credit incentives announced in last year’s federal budget.\nDue to start in July 2027, miners would receive a 10% tax break on the cost of processing critical minerals.\nDespite the potential benefits for the US, Park says it could be difficult to get Trump on board with investing in downstream processing in Australia, given his America-first approach to manufacturing.\n“In terms of getting an agreement out of the US, this is the real sticking point,” she says.\n“The ‘Make America Great Again’ focus on jobs and domestic manufacturing – it is going to be a hard sell to try and have it here in Australia, as opposed to in the US.”",

    "body": "Alarm bells are ringing on Wall Street. The recent collapses of Tricolor, a used car seller and sub-prime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto parts supplier, have put the finance industry on edge, almost two decades after problems in the sub-prime mortgage lending market set the stage for the global financial crisis.\n“When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase CEO, ominously cautioned analysts this week, after the US’s largest bank disclosed a $170m charge tied to Tricolor’s bankruptcy. “Everyone should be forewarned on this one.”\nAs the car lending market shows signs of strain, business around repossessions is booming. “Right now, we’re overwhelmed with work,” George Badeen, who runs Midwest Recovery and Adjustment in Detroit, Michigan, said.\nThe so-called repo man, tasked with recovering vehicles from drivers who default on loan agreements, was eulogized in music by Bruce Springsteen and in the 1984 Alex Cox film Repo Man.\nRepossessions – especially in the sub-prime auto market – are on the rise, according to Badeen, who is also president of the Allied Finance Adjusters trade body. “We’ve seen some sub-primes making changes, which probably indicates they’re having issues,” he said. “They’re not financing cars like they were. Two years ago they were financing anybody.”\nWhile few are bracing for a crisis on the scale of the crash that pushed the world economy to the brink in 2008 – sub-prime auto lending is a fraction of the $1.7tn overall car lending business – the collapses of Tricolor and First Brands have drawn the car sector into the spotlight, amid fears they highlight credit stress in lower-income households, as well as problems in credit markets tied to auto debt.\nFirst Brands received approval for $500m rescue financing from a bankruptcy court, although Scott Greenberg, an attorney for First Brand’s lenders, told the court of concerns that they could be “lending good money after bad”.\nThe wider fear – and the one causing consternation among investors – is what the troubles inside this one market might indicate about broader pressures rippling throughout the wider economy. “Distress in auto lending broadly is often seen as a bellwether to changing circumstances in the US economy, because Americans particularly in the lower-income brackets tend to put their highest priority in auto payments,” said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.\n“Having a car is essential to being able to work,” he added. “So when we see stress in the auto financing market, we typically receive that as an indication that household finances are getting tighter.”\nAn estimated 100 million Americans hold auto loans, with 85% of new car purchases and 55% of used car purchases financed. It is the third-largest consumer credit market in the US, behind mortgages and student loans.\nProblems in the auto loan industry have been manifesting for several years, as car prices rose sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic while inflation soared and interest rate increases followed. Paying off a new car required 42 weeks of income in 2023, according to Cox Automotive, up from about 33 before the pandemic.\nHigh prices meant bigger loans. The average monthly repayment now stands at more than $750.\nCar repossessions surged to their highest level since 2009 last year, according to Cox, with 1.73m vehicles seized, up 16% from the year prior and 43% from 2022.\nCar owners were found to be missing payments at the highest rate in more than 30 years in January, when a Fitch Ratings index monitoring the share of sub-prime auto borrowers at least 60 days past due on their loans hit 6.5%.\n“The consumer has been distressed for a little while,” Bill Nash, CEO of CarMax, the biggest seller of used cars in the US, told analysts last month after its lower sales and profits unnerved shareholders. “I think there’s some angst.”\nAuto loans are short-term investments, and Kevin Armstrong, author of Repo Blood: A Century of Auto Repossession History, believes they are often extended to consumers who may not be credit-worthy. For this reason, he said, auto loan delinquencies are often seen as clues – “one of the canaries in the coalmine” – to the health of the broader economy.\nLoan operators are now “giving out massive amounts of loan modification to try to move back delinquencies” to stave off repossession orders, Armstrong said. But they may only be buying time. “There’s a massive amount of recidivism when it comes to loan delinquencies,” he added.\nArmstrong traces the rise in repossessions to the pandemic, when stimulus checks and extra unemployment aid allowed consumers to pay up for pricier cars. “When Covid hit, prices went through the roof,” he said. “I watched people paying outrageous amounts for cars that just weren’t going to hold their value, and the dealers laughing all the way to the bank. They got hosed.”\nNow, coupled with higher mortgage or rental payments, high grocery bills and higher auto loan payments, he added: “Consumers got stuck with loan payments they can’t afford.”\nUnder most loan agreements, the lender or leaseholder can repossess the car even if borrowers are only a few weeks behind in payments, in part because a borrower could try to hide the car if they know the lender is looking to repossess it – and potentially sell it at auction.\nThe job of repossessing a car is becoming harder, according to Badeen, with greater consumer rights awareness and a higher likelihood of confrontation. “We’ve had so much violence in recent years that we’ve had to train our people in what people like to call situational awareness and de-escalation,” he said. His company typically now sends tow trucks out with two people, one to pick up the car and another to keep watch.\nThe clouds gathering over the auto lending market could grow darker. Should Congress fail to agree on a continuation of Covid-era healthcare subsidies, the political issue at the center of the current federal government shutdown, that could put more pressure on the finances of auto borrowers.\n“That whole mess comes out of Covid. It has an impact on individual people that many people don’t understand,” said Badeen. “Everything intertwines in some way, shape or form.”\nIf a large sub-prime lender stumbles as a result of this pressure – Santander Consumer is the nation’s biggest, and was last year fined $550m to resolve claims it violated consumer protection laws by placing borrowers with sub-prime credit into auto loans it knew carried an unacceptably high probability of default – there could be wider turbulence.\nUnlike First Brands, Tricolor sought bankruptcy protection last month under the shadow of fraud allegations that have prompted two federal investigations. Charles Gibbs, the attorney representing Tricolor’s court-appointed trustee, told a Texas court this month that initial reports “indicate potentially systemic levels of fraud”.\n“Tricolor’s failure is not necessarily indicative of what is immediately ahead for the sector as a whole, because of the special circumstances, but I would still see it as an economic warning indicator,” said House.\nArmstrong, too, was reluctant to call the failure of the companies, and the rise in repossessions, a trend. “But it’s on the verge,” he added.",

    "body": "Government shutdown becomes third-longest in history with no end in sight on Day 17\nWhat to know on Day 17 of the government shutdown:\n- The government shutdown is on Day 17 with no end in sight, after senators failed for the 10th time to resolve the impasse in votes on Thursday.\n- The shutdown is now the third-longest funding lapse in modern history, eclipsed only by the shutdowns of 1995 and 2018-19. Shutdowns are a relatively recent phenomenon, having only begun in their current form in 1980.\n- Senate Majority Leader John Thune sent the upper chamber home for the weekend after Thursday's votes, meaning the funding lapse will continue until at least Monday. The House has been out of session since Sept. 19 with no plans to return until the shutdown is over.\n- Thune's office said on Thursday that he will bring up a bill next week that would pay federal employees and military service members who have continued to work during the shutdown. But passing the legislation would require help from Democrats, who blocked a long-term defense spending bill from advancing.\n- The agency that oversees the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile told a top GOP lawmaker that it plans to furlough 80% of its staff in the coming days to address a funding shortfall. \"These are not employees that you want to go home,\" said Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\nSupreme Court to run out of funding Saturday, close to the public \"until further notice\"\nThe Supreme Court is expected to run out of federal funding on Saturday, according to Patricia McCabe, the court's public information officer. Without new money appropriated by Congress, the high court is expected to make changes in its operations to comply with the Anti-Deficiency Act, she said. That law prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance or above the amount approved by Congress.\nThe Supreme Court's building will be closed to the public \"until further notice,\" she said.

The cancellation means the House will have been on break for more than a month whenever they return. The House last voted on Sept. 19 to pass Republicans' short-term funding measure.\nThe House was scheduled to be out Sept. 22 through Sept. 26 and return for two days beginning Sept. 29. But House Speaker Mike Johnson canceled votes on Sept. 29 and Sept. 30. He also canceled votes on Oct. 7 through Oct. 10 and Oct. 14 through Oct. 17.\nThe House was previously on recess from the end of July through Labor Day in September.\nNuclear agency says 1,400 employees set to be furloughed, with 375 continuing to work\nRogers' office shared the notice that the National Nuclear Security Administration provided on Thursday. It said that the money used to pay salaries and expenses is expected to run out on Saturday. Once it does, roughly 1,400 employees will be placed on furlough, and 375 employees will continue to work.\nThe agency also said it was reviewing contractors' plans to place facilities in \"minimum-safe\" status — that is, continuing \"only those functions necessary to ensure the safety of life or protection of property.\" NNSA will \"provide estimates of the number of contractor employees affected upon finalization of those plans.\"\nJohnson calls potential lawsuit over Grijalva's swearing in \"a publicity stunt\"\nAt his daily press conference at the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson reacted to Jeffries' comment that refusing to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona would lead to \"swift and decisive legal action\" by the state's attorney general.\n\"I thought Hakeem was a better attorney than that. It's a publicity stunt by a Democrat attorney general in Arizona who sees a national moment and wants to call me out. She has nothing whatsoever to do with what's happening in Congress,\" Johnson said.\nHe added: \"Rep.-elect Grijalva is to be congratulated for winning her late father's seat. We love that. We're going to administer the oath to her as soon as we get back to our regular legislative session, as I've said a thousand times.\"\nJohnson said he holds \"no ill will towards her at all.\"\n\"I'm going to congratulate her as I do every colleague who comes in, and we'll do it as soon as we can get the government open again, and get all these Americans who are suffering taken care of,\" he said.\nArmed Services chair says agency that manages nuclear stockpile could see deep staff cuts\nAt the House Republicans' daily press conference, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the federal agency that oversees the country's stockpile of nuclear weapons is at risk of making deep staffing cuts as the shutdown continues.\n\"We were just informed last night that the National Nuclear Security Administration, the group that handles and manages our nuclear stockpile, that the carry-over funding they've been using is about to run out,\" Rogers said. \"They will have to lay off 80% of their employees. These are not employees that you want to go home. They're managing and handling a very important strategic asset for us. They need to be at work and being paid.\"\nA spokesperson for Rogers clarified that the chairman meant the staff would be placed on furlough, as opposed to laid off permanently.\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration is part of the Department of Energy, and one of its core missions is \"to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing,\" according to its website.\nCBS News has reached out to the Department of Energy for more details about Rogers' comment.\nRead more here.\nJeffries says to expect \"swift and decisive legal action\" if Grijalva is not sworn in today\nDemocrat Adelita Grijalva won a special election to fill her late father's seat several weeks ago, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear her in, saying he will do so once the House is back in full session.\nDemocrats have accused Johnson of slow-walking her swearing in to deny the last signature needed to force a vote on requiring the Justice Department to hand over files related to Jeffrey Epstein. They have tried to earn recognition during the House's brief pro forma sessions to call for her to be sworn in, with no success. Jeffries said Democrats would try again on Friday.\n\"This has gone on now for weeks, and so it's my expectation that, if she is not sworn in today, during the pro forma session today, as the Arizona attorney general has made clear, expect swift and decisive legal action,\" Jeffries said.\nEarlier this week, Arizona's Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes sent a letter to Johnson demanding Grijalva \"be immediately sworn into office and admitted to her rightful seat.\" She asked for Johnson to provide assurances within two days that he would do so, and threatened legal action if he did not.\n\"Should you fail to provide such assurance, we will be forced to seek judicial relief to protect Arizona and the residents of its Seventh Congressional District,\" Mayes said.\nJeffries said Friday that he has not heard from Johnson regarding the letter. Johnson has said the delay in Grijalva's swearing in has nothing to do with the Epstein files.\nJeffries says Democrats will \"hold firm\" on health care demands\nSpeaking at the Capitol, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats remain united in their demands for an extension of health care tax credits to reopen the government.\n\"House and Senate Democrats are going to continue to hold firm as it relates to a basic common sense position that when we enact spending bills, we should be helping the American people, not hurting them,\" Jeffries said.\n\"We need to reopen the government, and we need to reopen the government now,\" he said later. \"Part of the problem is that House Republicans are nowhere to be found, literally, have been on vacation for three consecutive weeks. Have canceled votes for three consecutive weeks. They are in the legislative witness protection program.\"\nWhen is the next Senate government shutdown vote?\nThe Senate is not in session Friday and plans to return at 3 p.m. Monday.\nThune said Thursday that senators will have another opportunity to vote on the House-passed GOP funding bill when they return next week, but no votes have been officially scheduled. The previous 10 votes on the GOP funding legislation have failed to reach the 60 votes needed to advance.\nThree Democrats have voted consistently to advance the measure, but five more would be needed to reach 60 votes, a dynamic that has not changed since the shutdown began.\nA history of government shutdowns: The 14 other times funding has lapsed since 1980\nA government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.\nPresident Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.\nThe longest shutdown occurred from late 2018 into early 2019, when funding lapsed for 34 days. The second-longest came in December 1995, at 21 days. The 2013 shutdown lasted for 16 full days, which the current shutdown has now eclipsed.\nRead more about the history of shutdowns here.\nThune plans vote on bill to pay federal employees who work during shutdown\nThune's office confirmed Thursday evening that the South Dakota Republican plans to bring up a bill next week that would pay \"excepted\" federal employees, including active-duty military, who are required to work during the shutdown.\nThune referred to the bill, from Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, as the \"pay everybody\" bill.\nTypically during a shutdown, some essential federal workers are expected to keep reporting to work, but they don't get paid until after the government reopens.\nNikole Killion and Alan He\nDHS officers — including at ICE — will get paid during shutdown, Noem says\nLaw enforcement officers from the Department of Homeland Security will be paid if they work during the government shutdown, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on X on Thursday afternoon.\nThat includes \"sworn law enforcement officers\" from the Transportation Security Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and the Secret Service.\nIt's not clear who at the TSA will be included in the policy. The agency employs tens of thousands of security officers who work at airport checkpoints, as well as law enforcement personnel like air marshals. CBS News has reached out to DHS and TSA for clarification.\nNoem said law enforcement officers will get a \"super check\" by Oct. 22 that covers four days of lost pay, overtime and their pay for the next pay period.\nMembers of the military and FBI have also been promised pay during the shutdown. The legal authority to keep paying federal workers remains unsettled.",

    "body": "Trump says both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory after meeting with Zelenskyy: \"Let history decide!\"\nWashington — After his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House Friday, President Trump said both Russia and Ukraine should declare victory and \"let history decide!\"\nZelenskyy told reporters after the meeting that he and Mr. Trump decided not to publicly discuss whether the U.S. will provide long-range weapons, including Tomahawks, citing the \"escalation\" that could bring in Russia's war on Ukraine. Zelenskyy's comment came mere hours after Mr. Trump expressed openness to trading U.S. Tomahawks for Ukrainian drones.\n\"We decided that we don't speak about it because nobody wants — the United States doesn't want escalation,\" Zelenskyy said.\nMr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Friday that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was \"very interesting, and cordial.\"\nHe continued, \"I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\"\nMr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy took place a day after the president spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin and then announced that he and Putin would meet soon in Budapest.\nThe president expressed some reservations about reducing the number of Tomahawks that the U.S. possesses, though long-range weapons were expected to be a major point of discussion for Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.\n\"Tomahawks are a big deal,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during the meeting with his Cabinet and Zelenskyy. \"But one thing I have to say, we want Tomahawks, also. We don't want to be giving away things that we need to protect our country.\"\n\"Hopefully, we'll be able to get the war over without thinking about Tomahawks. I think we're fairly close to that,\" Mr. Trump said.\nAfter Zelenskyy suggested Ukraine might give the U.S. Ukrainian drones in exchange for the Tomahawk missiles, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if it was a trade that interested him.\n\"We are, yeah,\" the president responded. \"They make a very good drone,\" he replied.\nZelenskyy and Mr. Trump shook hands when the Ukrainian president arrived at the White House, and a reporter asked the president if he believes he can persuade Putin to end the war. \"Yup,\" Mr. Trump responded.\nIn their meeting, Mr. Trump was seated across from Zelenskyy, who wore a military-style jacket for the occasion. Mr. Trump complimented him, saying, \"I think he looks beautiful in his jacket.\"\n\"It's an honor to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,\" Mr. Trump said in the meeting, adding he thinks they're making \"great progress\" in ending the war.\nZelenskyy congratulated Mr. Trump on the \"successful ceasefire\" in the Middle East, but he added that he thinks Putin is \"not ready\" to end the war with Ukraine.\nMr. Trump brought up the possibility that Zelenskyy could join his upcoming meeting with Putin in Budapest, but then added that the meetings \"may be separated.\" A date has not yet been set for Mr. Trump's meeting with the Russian leader.\nA reporter asked the president if he's concerned Putin may just be trying to buy more time with the Budapest meeting. \"Yeah, I am,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But you know, I've been played all my life by the best of them. And I came out really well. So, it's possible, yeah.\"\nMr. Trump had previously said the Tomahawks would be a \"new step of aggression\" in the Russia-Ukraine war. They'd enable Ukraine to strike deep within Russia.\n\"I might say 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send the Tomahawks,'\" Mr. Trump told reporters earlier this week. \"We may not, but we may do it.\"\nThe last time the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents met in person was in late September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy spoke twice over the weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, ahead of Mr. Trump's whirlwind Middle East trip to mark the Israel-Hamas peace deal.\nRussia has given no indication it wants to end the war. And Ukrainian authorities said there had been another large-scale Russian strike hours before Mr. Trump spoke with Putin on the phone.\n\"The massive overnight strike — launched hours before the conversation between Putin and President Trump — exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace,\" Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Olga Stefanishyna said in a statement Thursday. \"While discussions about ending the war continue, Russia once again chose missiles over dialogue, turning this attack into a direct blow to ongoing peace efforts led by President Trump.\"\nMr. Trump in recent months has expressed frustration with Putin over the failure to end the war, though on a separate front, first lady Melania Trump said last week that she has worked with the Russian leader's team to return Ukrainian children to their families. Mr. Trump said the first lady took up that initiative on her own.\nU.S. and Russian advisers will be meeting next week in a location that hasn't been disclosed yet ahead of the anticipated Trump-Putin meeting. The president indicated that initial meetings leading up to the meeting with the Russian leader would be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",

Since the plan took effect last week, Hamas has been accused of delaying handing over the remains of Israeli hostages still believed to be in the Palestinian territory.\nHamas has handed over the remains of at least seven confirmed hostages since the peace deal took effect, not including the body handed over Friday, which still needs to be identified.\nWhile Hamas returned the 20 living hostages by the Monday deadline, the remains of only four deceased Israeli captives were handed over. Hamas transferred an additional four bodies on Tuesday, but the IDF said one of them was not a hostage. If the remains handed over on Friday are confirmed to be an Israeli hostage, that means the remains of at least 20 hostages are still unaccounted for.\nA senior U.S. adviser told reporters on a call Wednesday that \"nobody is getting left behind,\" noting they believe there are still many bodies buried under the mountains of rubble across Gaza. Senior U.S. advisers said the level of destruction also makes it difficult to move around in the Palestinian territory.\n\"It would have been almost impossible for Hamas to mobilize, even if they knew where all the 28 bodies were, to mobilize and get them home,\" one adviser said Wednesday.\nStrikingly, the adviser said the U.S. is sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas to assist in finding hostage remains. The adviser also said Turkey has offered to help search for and retrieve remains by sending in expert teams with experience rescuing people from the frequent earthquakes in the country.\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz said Thursday that American personnel would be part of the effort to recover the remains of the hostages that have yet to be turned over.\nDuring negotiations that led to the peace deal, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to Israeli media reports. President Trump also said in Egypt on Monday that not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.\nThe senior U.S. advisers who spoke to reporters on Wednesday urged patience and said they are not at a point where they feel that the agreement has been violated, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains still in Gaza.\nBoth the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the group that represents the hostage families, and Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz have previously said the entire peace deal should be shelved until all of the hostages' remains are returned by Hamas.",

    "body": "Skeletons found in well identified as Roman soldiers killed 1,700 years ago\nSeven fully preserved skeletons found in an ancient city in Croatia have been identified as Roman soldiers who would have lived 1,700 years ago, scientists said in a new paper.\nThe skeletal remains were found in 2011 during a dig at the Roman city of Mursa, located in modern-day Croatia, in a water well that had been repurposed as a mass grave, said the researchers, who are from a number of European archaeological institutions. The area was conquered by Romans during the first century B.C., and the city was an \"important trade and craft center\" that bordered an active military zone, according to the paper published this week.\nAll seven skeletons were identified as belonging to taller-than-average adult men. Four are younger adults, between 18 and 25, while the other three are middle-aged, between 36 and 50, the researchers found. All were \"robust\" but showed \"indicators of early-life stress\" such as wear on the teeth.\nThe skeletons were placed in different positions and at different depths, the researchers said, but all appear to have been buried at the same time. The remains seem to have been \"thrown in\" shortly after death, the researchers said. The men were likely soldiers who may have participated in a 260 C.E. battle for the city or died in a skirmish afterward, according to the researchers.\nSeveral of the skeletons had injuries, including blunt-force injuries on the facial bones of one and puncture wounds on the torsos of two others that were likely caused by weapons such as arrows or spear tips, according to the paper. The wounds and their locations were determined by analysis of the skeletal remains.\nThe researchers were also able to use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to learn more about the soldiers' day-to-day lives. They ate lots of grains, including wheat and millet, and vegetables, but little meat, the study found. Four of the skeletons underwent DNA analysis, which found that none appeared to be local to the area. One was likely from northern or Eastern Europe, while another was likely from the Byzantine Empire.\nRemains of Mursa have been explored by researchers for decades. Archaeologists have found a number of water wells, small pits and other evidence of civilization.\nMursa was affected by a number of conflicts, the researchers said. Many occurred during the Crisis of the Third Century, an era during which Rome nearly collapsed due to civil wars, foreign invasions and economic issues, according to CBS News' partner network BBC News. The city eventually \"ceased to exist as an urban settlement\" after attacks in 441 C.E., the researchers said.",

The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.\n\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"\nHe continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"\nGiuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.\nGiuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.\nIn an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.\n\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled — as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"\nAndrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.\nHis attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals — such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring — and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.\nWithin days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.\nAs well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.\nHe will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth.",

The charges were brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.\nAl-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel after hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.\nAl-Muhtadi's phone pinged a cell tower near Kibbutz Kfar Aza at about 10:01 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, the documents said, a few hours after the attack began. Kibbutz Kfar Aza is just a few miles from Gaza's border. Sixty people were killed there, and 19 were kidnapped, the court documents said. More than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage during the attack. The documents do not accuse al-Muhtadi of any killings or specific crimes.\nAl-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel within hours of hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.\nAl-Muhtadi allegedly submitted a U.S. visa application in June 2024, the court documents said. In the application, he said that he was not a member or representative of a terror organization, that he had no specialized skills or training, including firearm usage, and had never engaged in terrorist activities.\nHe met with a U.S. Embassy consular official in August and entered the United States through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Sept. 12, 2024, according to the documents. He lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several months, the documents said. Photos shared by al-Muhtadi on social media show him posing with a gun in his Tulsa apartment.\nIn early 2025, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents located al-Muhtadi living in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he worked in a local restaurant.\nA person with al-Muhtadi's name and birth date was being held at the St. Martin Parish Correctional Center near Lafayette, according to online records. He was booked into the facility on Thursday. He made his initial court appearance on Friday, according to court records. Online records did not make it clear if he had a lawyer.\nFederal prosecutors have previously charged six senior Hamas leaders with the deaths of at least 43 American citizens on Oct. 7. Those charged included former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in October 2024.",

    "body": "Zelenskyy expected to press Trump for increased long-range weapons and targeting help\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to press President Trump not only for long range Tomahawk missiles and upgraded air defense capabilities, but also for increased intelligence sharing to help his forces inflict more damage on Russia's energy sector.\nA Ukrainian and a U.S. lawmaker told CBS News that Kyiv wants to purchase equipment to upgrade its existing weapons systems, including for the F-16 jets it already possesses. On Thursday, Zelenskyy also met with executives from defense firm Lockheed Martin about the F-16 aircraft, as well as missiles. He also met with Raytheon, which makes Patriot missile systems, about potential joint manufacturing.\nEnergy supply is the less conventional weapon to be discussed Friday, and it's a key interest for Mr. Trump. CBS News confirmed the U.S. has been aiding Ukraine through intelligence support in its efforts to hit Russian energy supplies, according to sources familiar with the U.S. efforts. Energy is the main source of income for Moscow's war chest.\nAhead of the cold winter months, Ukraine and Russia have been targeting each other's energy sector to deprive — or at least make more costly — the supply of heat and electricity. The Ukrainian government says that Russia has attacked the infrastructure at Naftogaz, the largest gas and oil company in Ukraine, six times this month as part of its campaign.\nDuring his Washington visit this week, Zelenskyy had meetings with U.S. energy company executives that he said had been proposed by President Trump himself. He posted on social media videos of discussions with those executives and can be heard speaking in English about liquified natural gas terminals.\nZelenskyy also met with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and said that they discussed the Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy and the need to restore the facilities that were damaged in the attacks.\nThe Wall Street Journal was first to report on Oct. 1 that Mr. Trump had recently signed off on allowing U.S. intelligence and the Pentagon to aid Kyiv with strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Last week, the Financial Times reported that U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv had indeed already enabled strikes on important Russian energy assets far beyond the frontline.\nThat targeting indicates a more aggressive posture by the Trump administration than its rhetoric would indicate.\nAsked about the Financial Times' reporting, House Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the Ukrainian attacks on refineries had reduced Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other products by almost 20%.\nHimes, a member of the Gang of 8, the congressional leaders who are privy to sensitive classified information, said that despite Trump's often friendly rhetoric toward Russia, his actions had not necessarily matched up.\n\"His rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation.\"\nEnergy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy, who confirmed that 20% damage figure to CBS News, tallied at least 18 Russian refineries that have been hit by at least one Ukrainian drone strike, affecting nearly half of Russian distillation capacity. This has reduced Russia's ability to export refined products and has contributed to gasoline shortages within Russia.\nThe pain is clearly being felt by Moscow. On Sept. 30, the Russian government also announced an extension of its temporary ban on gasoline exports through the end of the year. Diesel, marine fuel and other gas oils were also banned.\nMr. Trump has been mulling whether to provide long-range weapons like Tomahawks to Ukraine, which is a step former President Joe Biden did not take. Both presidents have had concerns that strikes deep inside Russian territory that are facilitated by U.S. equipment would be perceived as escalatory and trigger a Russian response that could potentially draw in the U.S. or other NATO members.\nTrump indicated to reporters on Thursday that he may not provide Tomahawks: \"We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So, you know, they're very vital, they're very powerful. They're very accurate, they're very good, but we need them too.\"\nIn the meantime, Ukraine's own offensive drone technology has rapidly developed, enabling it to strike targets well inside the Russian territorial borders. Some of the hits on energy installations have been carried out by drones, according to Bloomberg News.\nA lawmaker familiar with developing Ukraine policy told CBS News that Ukraine's offensive drone technology is a potential game changer. Ukraine does not need U.S. permission to use drones it has produced to strike Russia, but it does need U.S. permission to strike into Russia with U.S.-provided weapons. The Trump administration's decision to provide long-range targeting intelligence would allow for increased effectiveness of the Ukrainian drones, which would make it less vital for the U.S. to provide weapons for the same purpose.\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that it is finally time to move in the next 30 days on the secondary sanctions bill that would further reduce Russia's ability to sell oil to buyers like India, China, and others. The bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and a veto-proof majority, so, if it makes it to Mr. Trump's desk, he would have to sign it into law.\nThere is also a second bill Congress being considered in the coming days that would designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for the crime of kidnapping of Ukrainian children, which could trigger further financial penalties. Republican Senators Katie Britt and Lindsay Graham as well as Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal are co-sponsoring the measure.\nLast week, first lady Melania Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally responded to her advocacy on behalf of Ukrainian children by promising to discuss future releases of children. Yale University investigators estimate that at least 35,000 Ukrainian children have been taken into Russia, and the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, given his direct role in the scheme.\nThe Trump administration is hoping that the increased economic and military pressure will jumpstart the stalled diplomatic track. On Thursday, President Trump said he expected to meet again soon with Putin, perhaps in Budapest, Hungary.\nUkraine remains skeptical of Putin's intentions. Ukraine's new ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, said that the massive overnight missile strike by Russia hours before Presidents Putin and Trump spoke by phone Thursday exposes \"Moscow's real attitude toward peace.\"",

Starmer called the move by authorities in Birmingham, England, to block Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an upcoming game against the city's Aston Villa team a misstep.\n\"This is the wrong decision. We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Friday.\nA safety advisory group made up of authorities who give advice on welfare, health and safety for events in Birmingham made the decision to ban traveling Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending the November 6 match earlier this week.\nU.K. police authorities supported the decision after classifying the game as a \"high risk\" public event.\nThe decision was made in line with \"current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offenses that occurred during the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel-Aviv in Amsterdam,\" said a statement Thursday from the West Midlands Police force, which covers Birmingham.\nFollowing Starmer's comments, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster asked the Safety Advisory Group to review its decision to ban the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans.\n\"Any decision or recommendation, is ultimately a matter for the Birmingham City Council SAG and the independent, objective and impartial, operational policing judgment, of West Midlands Police,\" Foster said.\nThe violence last year in Amsterdam cited by West Midlands police, which happened against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, drew global attention. Maccabi fans were among hundreds to march through central Amsterdam demonstrating in support of Israel before a game against the Dutch team Ajax. During the marches, flares were lit and Palestinian flags hung on some streets were torn down amid chants of \"death to the Arabs\" by some Maccabi Tel Aviv fans.\nIn the aftermath of that game, some local people in Amsterdam \"actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them,\" police authorities in the Netherlands said, sparking a furious reaction from the Israeli government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the violence as a \"premeditated antisemitic attack.\"\nSixty-two people were arrested and five injured amid the unrest, Dutch police said at the time.\nMaccabi Tel Aviv supporters do have a history of causing unrest at recent soccer games. A March report by an anti-racism group in Israel said the team's fans were the most prolific in singing racist chants during games over the last league season, according to Israeli news outlet Ynet.\nThe decision to block Israeli visiting supporters also came just weeks after a deadly terror attack on a synagogue in the northeast England city of Manchester. Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured during the attack, which happened on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.\nPolice later said one of the two victims was likely killed by police gunfire as officers raced to stop the suspect, who first rammed his car into people and then attacked with a knife outside the synagogue. Officers shot and killed the suspect, who investigators later identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent.\nThe ban on the Israeli soccer fans also comes in the wake of a suspected arson attack on a mosque in the town of Peacehaven, in southern Britain. Police said they are investigating that incident as a possible hate crime.\nBirmingham, the U.K's second largest city, has one of the largest Muslim populations in Britain.",

    "body": "Trump and Putin's ally Viktor Orbán enthuses over planned Ukraine war summit in Hungary\nHungary's far-right, nationalist leader Viktor Orbán has hailed President Trump's announcement that he'll hold a second summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to discuss the war in Ukraine, in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, as \"great news for the peace-loving people of the world.\"\nOrbán is one of the very few European leaders who has kept close ties with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nHe is also a key ally of Mr. Trump, having built a close relationship with the president over many years, helping to turn himself into a favorite European figure on the American right.\n\"The planned meeting between the American and Russian presidents is great news for the peace-loving people of the world. We are ready!,\" Orbán - whom the European Union has accused of turning Hungary into an autocracy - said in a social media post on Thursday. \"Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are underway. Hungary is the island of PEACE!\"\nMr. Trump is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday following a long phone call he had Thursday with Russia's leader. \"I believe great progress was made,\" Mr. Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social regarding his conversation with Putin.\nThe Kremlin said in a statement Friday that Orbán had spoken with Putin on the phone to express Hungary's \"readiness to provide conditions\" for the upcoming summit.\nThe date for the Trump-Putin summit in Budapest has not been confirmed, though Mr. Trump said Thursday that it would likely take place within a couple weeks.\nIt will be the two leaders' second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August.\nThat initial effort by Mr. Trump to end the Ukraine war yielded no tangible results. Putin has so far declined the president's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, the Russian military has continued its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities, targeting infrastructure and killing civilians.\nBefore his announcement on Thursday, President Trump had voiced increasing frustration with Putin's intransigence on negotiating an end to the war.\n\"I don't know why he continues with this war,\" Mr. Trump told reporters earlier this week in Washington. \"He just doesn't want to end that war.\"\nThe Kremlin, in a Thursday statement attributed to Putin aide Yury Ushakov, said the Russian leader had given Mr. Trump during their phone call \"a detailed assessment of the current situation,\" which included noting that on the ground in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, \"the Russian Armed Forces hold full strategic initiative along the entire line of contact.\"\nWhy Ukraine may be disappointed by Hungary as a summit venue\nOrbán's government has often taken an adversarial stance toward Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian cause since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago.\nWhile Hungary is a member of both the European Union and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, Orbán has been a fierce critic of Europe's financial and military support for Ukraine's efforts to repel the Russian invasion. Hungary has halted all sales of weapons to Ukraine since the war began, and Orbán's government has also prohibited weapons from Ukraine's Western partners from transiting through the country.\nEarlier this week, Orbán posted a promotional video on social media declaring that \"Hungary will follow its own path, protect its sovereignty, refuse to send its money to Ukraine, and remain a haven of peace. We will not pay for wars that are not ours!\"\nTension between Orbán and Zelenskyy has escalated dramatically in recent months.\nBudapest has fiercely opposed Ukraine's bid to join the European Union — a move Kyiv sees as a vital step in protecting itself against the potential threat of future Russian aggression.\nUnder EU rules, new states can only be admitted with the unanimous consent of all its existing members.\n\"Hungary has no moral obligation to support Ukraine's EU accession. No country has ever blackmailed its way into the European Union — and it won't happen this time either,\" Orbán said earlier this month. \"The EU Treaty leaves no room for ambiguity: membership is decided by the member states, unanimously.\"\nZelenskyy was quoted in May by the Ukrainian Interfax news agency as calling Hungary's opposition to Ukraine's bid \"dangerous\" for the EU, \"because that's the sovereign choice of another country. Just as we have no right to interfere in Hungary's affairs.\"\nKyiv has also accused Hungary of illegally flying drones into Ukrainian territory. In September, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a map on social media of an alleged Hungarian drone incursion with the caption: \"Our Armed Forces have gathered all of the necessary evidence, and we are still waiting for Hungary to explain what this object did in our airspace.\"\nOrbán appeared to acknowledge the incursion late last month in an interview on a podcast produced by his far-right Fidesz party, while also questioning Ukraine's independence, echoing a talking point often promoted by the Kremlin.\n\"Let's suppose they flew a few meters in there [Ukraine], and so what?\" Orbán said, according to the Reuters news agency. \"Ukraine is not an independent country. Ukraine is not a sovereign country. Ukraine is financed by us, the West gives it funds, weapons.\"\nSybiha, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, said in a social media post that Orbán's remarks showed he was \"intoxicated by Russian propaganda.\"\nWhile Hungary has participated in imposing several rounds of EU sanctions against Russia since the war started, Orbán has consistently called for greater economic relief for the Kremlin.\n\"It's time to talk about sanctions! Did they bring the war to an end? No. Did they cripple the [Russian] economy? No. Did Europe manage to replace Russian energy from other affordable sources? No,\" Orbán said in January. \"The sanctions engineered by the Brussels bureaucrats achieved one thing: they destroyed the competitiveness of the European economy.\"\nBudapest has defied other EU nations' efforts to wean themselves off a years-long reliance on Russian oil and gas — despite repeated calls from both Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to do so to squeeze Putin's ability to fund the war.\nResearch from the Center for the Study of Democracy, an independent policy think tank, shows Hungary has actually increased its reliance on Russian energy over the past three years. Hungary's purchases of Russian crude oil increased from 61% of its total imports pre-invasion, to 86% in 2024, the study showed.\nOrban is a key Trump ally\nWhile Hungary is not perceived as friendly to Ukraine, President Trump will arrive to a warm welcome in Budapest if the summit goes ahead.\nOrbán was the first and only EU leader to publicly endorse Mr. Trump's first successful bid for the U.S. presidency in 2016, and the two have had warm ties ever since.\nOrbán, who according to Human Rights Watch has used his party's supermajority in the Hungarian parliament to undermine the independence of the country's judiciary, crack down on independent media, demonize migrants and discriminate against LGBTQ people, was also effusive in praising Mr. Trump's return to the Oval Office in January.\n\"The Trump tsunami swept through the entire world,\" Orbán said earlier this year. \"It gave back hope to the world. We are no longer suffocating in the woke sea.\"\nIn 2022, the EU said Hungary, under Orbán's leadership, could no longer be considered a \"full democracy,\" calling it a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy.\"\nMr. Trump has also prolifically praised Orbán's strongman leadership, calling him \"a great man and a very special person.\"",

    "body": "King Charles and Pope Leo will pray together in the Sistine Chapel, officials say. Here's why it's historic.\nThe Catholic Church and Church of England will take a historic step on the path to unity next week when Britain's King Charles III and Pope Leo XIV pray together in the Sistine Chapel, officials said Friday.\nThe two churches have been divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests, which the Catholic Church prohibits. An ecumenical prayer service on Oct. 23 will mark the first time since the Reformation, in the 16th century, that the heads of the two Christian churches pray together. The service will draw on the shared concern for care of God's creation.\nBuckingham Palace and Vatican officials on Friday announced details of the two-day trip that Charles and Queen Camilla will undertake on Oct. 22-23. The visit was previously scheduled for April but was postponed after Pope Francis' final illness, shortly before his death.\nCharles, who is titular head of the Church of England, strongly wanted to visit the Vatican during the 2025 Holy Year, a once-every-quarter century celebration of Christianity. In doing so, he is following in the footsteps of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who visited during the 2000 Jubilee, said Monsignor Flavio Pace, secretary of the Vatican's office for promoting Christian unity.\nIn that visit, however, a proposal for Queen Elizabeth to pray with the pope was dropped over concerns it would upset factions within the Church of England, The Guardian reported at the time.\nDuring his visit, Charles will be given a formal new title and recognition at a pontifical basilica that has strong, traditional ties to the Church of England, St. Paul's Outside the Walls. The title \"Royal Confrater\" is a sign of spiritual fellowship and will be given to Charles along with a special chair decorated with his coat of arms that will remain in the basilica for Charles and his heirs to use, officials said.\nAnglicans split from the Catholic Church in 1534 when English King Henry VIII was refused a marriage annulment. While popes for decades have forged warm relations with the Church of England and the broader Anglican Communion on a path toward greater unity, the two churches remain divided on issues.\nSignificantly, the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, Sarah Mullally, will not join the king and queen since she hasn't been formally installed as the Church of England's spiritual leader. She is the first woman to hold the position, which is considered the first among equals in the broader Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members spread across 165 countries.\nIn her place, the archbishop of York will preside with Leo in the Sistine Chapel service, which will feature hymns sung by members of the royal choirs alongside the Sistine Chapel choir, Pace said.\nPace dodged a question about whether the Sistine Chapel service would have gone ahead as planned had Mullally been installed in time and joined the king and queen on the visit. He noted past joint statements of the Catholic and Anglican churches acknowledging their differences over women's ordination but insisting that such obstacles shouldn't prevent theological dialogue from continuing.\nCharles and Camilla's trip was originally scheduled for April as part of a joint Vatican-Italy state visit. After Francis got sick, the king and queen went ahead with the planned four-day leg in Italy, and briefly greeted Francis at the Vatican just a few weeks before he died.",

Michael Randrianirina's power was cemented after weeks of youth-led \"Gen Z\" protests culminated a dramatic few days of unrest, capped by former President Andry Rajoelina's impeachment by the country's highest court on Tuesday, for desertion of duty.\nAfter weeks of demonstrations over a lack of jobs, water and regular power cuts, representatives of the youth-led protest movement stood Friday beside politicians and foreign delegations, including representatives from the U.S., to witness the swearing-in ceremony for the 51-year-old coup leader.\nRandriairina said Friday that Madagascar had been propelled to a historic turning point, \"with a people in full fervor, driven by the desire for change and a deep love for their homeland,\" and he said his leadership would \"joyfully open a new chapter in the life of our nation.\"\nAt least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured amid the mass unrest over the last few weeks, according to United Nation figures. As the violence flared last weekend, Randriairina appeared in a video, calling on soldiers to side with the student protest leaders.\nHours after the video was posted online, soldiers were seen clashing with police in the capital. There was no sign of or word from then-President Rajoelina during the chaos, leaving rumors to swirl that he had fled the country.\n\"Nothing is working in Madagascar, there is no president, no president of the senate, no president of the government,\" Randriairina declared, appearing on the streets. \"Nothing is working, so we have to take responsibility, that's it.\"\nFrench media reported that forces from the country, which was Madagascar's colonial ruler until the late 1950s, had evacuated Rajoelina to Reunion Island, and that he later flew to Dubai.\nIn a statement cited by the French news agency AFP, Rajoelina said he left the country between October 11 and 12, after \"explicit and extremely serious threats\" to his life.\nOn October 14, the former president was impeached by the National Assembly, a move later approved Madagascar's highest court, and the military seized power.\nBoth the United Nations and the African Union have condemned the military's takeover, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying Thursday that \"the unconstitutional change of government in Madagascar\" should be reversed by a \"return to constitutional order and the rule of law,\" according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.\nThe African Union suspended Madagascar's membership and called for immediate elections and a return to civilian rule.\nRandrianirina had become a vocal critic of Rajoelina in recent years, and he was arrested and imprisoned in November 2023 for three months after for instigating a mutiny.\nAmid the international criticism, Randrianirina denied this week that he had initiated a coup, pointing to the constitutional court's backing of his new role. Speaking with journalists at various times this week, he was careful to repeatedly deny that it even was a coup, saying at one point: \"I don't think there was a coup. The army is just showing the Malagasy people that we still exist.\"\nAt the swearing-in ceremony, Randrianirina shed his military garb for a suit and tie and said he would appoint a civilian prime minister and hold elections within two years.\nHe has suspended most civil institutions in the country, however, and announced a new military council made up of army and police officers to lead the nation, which is home to some 32 million people.\nThis is the third military power transition Madagascar has seen since gaining independence from France, with previous coups putting commanders in power in 1972 and 2009.\nWorld Bank figures show up to 80% of the country's population lives below the poverty line, making it one of the world's poorest nations.\nIt is also the latest of several former French African colonies to fall under military control in just half of a decade, following coups in Mali, Gabon, Niger, Burkina Faso and Guinea.",

Authorities had closed two runways at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on Tuesday while officials tried to capture Amalka the dog.\nIn September 2023, a similar incident unfolded at one of the busiest transit hubs in the U.S. when a Chihuahua mix named Maia escaped from her carrier and ran onto an active runway at Atlanta's airport. The incident occurred while the dog was being transferred between Delta Air Lines and the airport after her owner was detained for not having the proper documents to enter the U.S. Maia was eventually found by a Good Samaritan after 22 days on the tarmac.",

Andic, 71, died in December after plunging more than 300 feet while hiking with his eldest son Jonathan in the Montserrat mountains near Barcelona.\nPolice initially ruled the death accidental, but they are now investigating Jonathan for a possible homicide, Spain's major daily newspaper El Pais reported on Thursday, citing \"different sources with knowledge of the investigation.\"\nThe family rejected the suggestion of any responsibility by Andic's son, saying in a statement cited by the Reuters news agency that it would \"continue to cooperate, as it has done until now, with the competent authorities. Furthermore, it trusts that this process will be concluded as soon as possible and that it will prove Jonathan Andic's innocence.\"\nJonathan, who was the only person with his father at the time of the incident, has provided \"inconsistent\" testimony in two declarations, which has \"fueled suspicion,\" authorities said, according to El Pais and other outlets.\nJonathan Andic is listed as the Vice-Chairman of the Mango Board on the company's website.

The data was first reported by ABC News.\nThe B-52 is a long-range bomber capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, according to the Air Force. It was used extensively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe mission follows a monthslong uptick in military activity in the waters off Venezuela. President Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the area. In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.\nThe military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he has authorized covert CIA operations in the South American country, and said his administration is considering strikes on drug traffickers by land.\nTensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan for narco-terrorism five years ago, and the administration increased the bounty for his capture to $50 million earlier this year.\nMaduro has denied ties to drug cartels and lashed out at the Trump administration for its strikes on alleged drug boats, accusing it of plotting regime change. Mr. Trump has not publicly said he is seeking the ouster of Maduro, whose 2018 and 2024 election victories were marred by widespread allegations of fraud.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not say whether the CIA has authority to take out Maduro, telling CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer.\"\nThe boat strikes have also drawn domestic pushback, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing that Mr. Trump needs congressional authority to carry out the strikes and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.\nThe Trump administration has asserted that it does not need permission from Congress. It has argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it called \"unlawful combatants,\" in a notice to lawmakers obtained by CBS News.",

In April, he was sentenced to 87 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay $373,949.97 in fines and restitution.\n\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\" the president's post said.\n\"I am forever grateful to President Trump for seeing the human side of the suffering that Congressman Santos went through. He was in solitary confinement and protective custody due to threats against his life. I am grateful that President Trump saw the humanity and did the right thing for the Congressman,\" Santos' attorney Joseph Murray said in a statement.\nIn a subsequent statement, Murray went on to thank Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Rep. Lauren Boebert, Rep. Tim Burchett and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, among others.\nSantos was elected to serve New York's 3rd congressional district in 2022. The next year, he was expelled from Congress after a House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" he violated the law.\nCongressman Nick LaLota, another Long Island Republican, who called Santos \"an embarrassment,\" and fought to get him thrown out of office, said he deserved to stay in prison longer.\n\"George Santos didn't merely lie — he stole millions, defrauded an election, and his crimes (for which he pled guilty) warrant more than a three-month sentence. He should devote the rest of his life to demonstrating remorse and making restitution to those he wronged,\" LaLota posted on social media Friday.\nSantos was accused of exaggerating or lying about parts of his backstory shortly after his election. He was charged with defrauding voters and donors in his district, which includes Nassau County and parts of Queens.\nAccusations against him ranged from falsely claiming he was a multi-millionaire to forging a diploma from Baruch College. He was also accused of soliciting donations to a fictitious nonprofit and engaging in credit card fraud to steal from elderly and cognitively impaired donors.\nAfter his sentencing, Santos released a lengthy statement on social media that said, in part, \"I believe that 7 years is an over the top politically influenced sentence and I implore that President Trump gives me a chance to prove I'm more than the mistakes I've made.\"\nA commutation is not a pardon, so Santos' record will not be wiped clean.",

He's offered everything,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States.\"\nMr. Trump made the comments during a meeting with his Cabinet at the White House and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Just two days ago, the president confirmed he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations in the country.\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. has conducted deadly strikes off the coast of Venezuela on vessels suspected of drug trafficking, killing more than two dozen people, according to figures released by the Trump administration. A boat the U.S. struck in the Caribbean on Thursday had survivors who are now on a U.S. Navy ship, a U.S. official told CBS News.\nIt's highly unusual for an American president to confirm the existence of an ongoing CIA operation, as Mr. Trump did on Wednesday. CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe asked him, \"Why did you authorize the CIA to go into Venezuela?\"\n\"I authorized for two reasons, really,\" Mr. Trump responded, accusing Venezuelans of having \"emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\"\n\"And the other thing are drugs,\" he added. \"We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela.\"\nThe U.S. has been turning up the pressure on Venezuela in the past few months. The Justice Department has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel that traffics drugs into the U.S. In August, the deparment increased the reward it's offering for information leading to his capture, raising it to $50 million.\nMr. Trump has also deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the region as part of what he has said is an operation to combat drug smuggling into the United States. CBS News has also learned there are about 10,000 U.S. forces built up in the Caribbean either on ships or in Puerto Rico.",

    "body": "Trump asks Supreme Court to allow deployment of National Guard in Illinois\nWashington — President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to allow the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois, teeing up a showdown over the president's power to send troops into jurisdictions over the objections of local authorities.\nThe Justice Department is asking the high court to freeze a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from ordering the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops within Illinois. A U.S. appeals court on Thursday upheld the decision as to the deployment of service members, but allowed the Guard to remain under federal service while legal proceedings continue.\nIn a request for emergency relief, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the order from a U.S. district court judge \"countermands the exercise of the President's Commander-in-Chief authority and projects its own authority into the military chain of command.\"\nHe argued that forbidding the deployment of federalized Guard troops \"eviscerates\" Mr. Trump's decision to call into federal service 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to protect federal immigration officers and government property. The president also federalized up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard to assist in the Chicago area.\n\"It deprives DHS officers of the protections that the President sought to give them from ongoing violence, prevents the Guard from ensuring the enforcement of federal law, and puts lives and property in danger,\" Sauer wrote. \"It also places the Seventh Circuit in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the President's Commander-in-Chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the President can deploy.\"\nMr. Trump has invoked a law known as Title 10 to federalize National Guard troops to protect immigration personnel and government facilities in several cities, where protests have sprung up in response to the administration's immigration agenda. The law allows the president to call the members of any state's National Guard into federal service if there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the U.S. government, or if the president \"is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"\nThe Trump administration has argued that demonstrations in some cities, including outside of Chicago, satisfy those conditions, allowing the president to exercise his authority under Title 10. In Illinois, government officials have argued that \"violence and the constant threat of violence\" have left regular federal law enforcement forces in Chicago unable to fully execute U.S. immigration laws, as well as those against assaulting and obstructing federal officers.\nThe administration has also said that violence targeting federal authorities and property in Illinois in recent weeks constitutes a \"rebellion or danger of rebellion.\"\nMr. Trump had threatened for weeks to mobilize the National Guard within Illinois amid confrontations outside a processing facility for immigrant detainees in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago. Then, in early October, the president said the situation in Chicago had become dangerous for federal agencies, and exercised his authority to call members of the Illinois National Guard into federal service.\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker denounced the move and called it \"un-American to demand a governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\"\nPritzker wrote Friday on X that Illinois \"will keep defending the sovereignty of our state.\"\nThe state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sued over the federalization of National Guard members, arguing that the directives are unlawful. The Trump administration has argued that courts cannot review the president's move.\nU.S. District Judge April Perry sided with the state earlier this month, finding that the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the events in Chicago to be \"unreliable.\"\nA panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit then issued a preliminary order temporarily blocking the deployment of Guard troops in Illinois, but said they could remain under federal control. In its decision Thursday, a unanimous panel of judges maintained that posture, finding \"the facts do not justify\" Mr. Trump's actions in Illinois.\n\"The spirited, sustained, and occasionally violent actions of demonstrators in protest of the federal government's immigration policies and actions, without more, does not give rise to a danger of rebellion against the government's authority,\" the judges wrote in an unsigned ruling.\nThey also noted that federal facilities, including the processing center in Broadview, have remained open amid the protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies, and said disruptions have been contained by local, state and federal authorities.\nClashes over the president's immigration policies have led the president to federalize and deploy members of the National Guard to the Los Angeles area, Portland and Memphis. A federal appeals court allowed Mr. Trump to deploy roughly 4,000 of California's National Guard to Los Angeles and is weighing a bid to allow the mobilization of troops to Portland.\nMr. Trump has also sent National Guard troops to the streets of Washington, D.C., and has threatened to deploy members to cities including Baltimore and San Francisco.",

    "body": "CBS News ends over 60-year presence at Pentagon after declining to sign new press requirements\nFor the first time in more than 60 years, CBS News will close out the week without a workspace in the Pentagon after declining — along with nearly every major news organization — to sign onto new press requirements that reporters' associations say could infringe on their First Amendment rights.\nDuring D-Day, CBS News radio correspondent Joseph F. McCaffrey reported live from the Pentagon about the strategy and General Dwight D. Eisenhower's background.\n\"Most of the plotting, the working, the split-haired timing was done in this building,\" McCaffrey reported on June 6, 1944. \"Although only a chosen few knew when the day would arrive, the atmosphere here in the Pentagon building has been tense for several weeks.\" Listen to the audio here.\nCBS News had radio correspondents in the building since the 1940s and a TV network booth, or mini-office, in an area designated for media since the 1970s. Over the past two decades, as the networks have been able to go live from the building, \"on-air\" lights flash on when major news breaks, and journalists relay information to the public live from the Pentagon.\nFor most of that time, CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin was the one breaking the news and reporting out every story. The Pentagon gave him his first press badge in 1983, his longtime producer Mary Walsh 10 years later. Since then, the duo has not only covered every military conflict, but also told stories about the military's service members and their lives.\n\"I'm proud of the work David Martin and I have done, telling stories of valor on the battlefield and courage and resilience at Walter Reed,\" Walsh wrote in an email before turning in her Pentagon press credential this week. \"I have been inspired and humbled by the fortitude of these men and women, their willingness to sacrifice everything for our country.\"\nMany of those stories emerged from relationships built because of CBS News' constant presence inside the Pentagon.\n\"Walking the halls of the Pentagon was my M.O. for 40 years. I don't know how else to cover a story except by being there,\" Martin wrote in an email. \"I would guess that 90 per cent of the stories I broke were a result of being in the hallways and visiting officials in their offices.\"\n\"Not every official was glad to see me but dealing with them face to face, day in and day out, developed a level of trust on both sides. Sometimes relationships got tense but never acrimonious,\" Martin wrote. \"Even when [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs] Colin Powell was yelling at me to get the hell out of his way, I knew I could go back and talk to him the next day.\"\nMartin's first day on the job as CBS News Pentagon correspondent was April 18, 1983, the day a previously unknown terrorist group called Hezbollah blew up the American embassy in Beirut.\n\"Nobody knew it at the time, but that was the start of the age of terror,\" Martin said.\n\"The next 40 years included the invasion of Grenada, Panama, the First Gulf War, the air war against Serbia, 9/11, the invasion of first Afghanistan and then Iraq, the Bin Laden raid and the withdrawal from Afghanistan — not to mention all the cultural issues, like women in combat. I cannot imagine covering any of those stories without a building pass,\" Martin wrote.\nBob Schieffer, the moderator of \"Face the Nation\" from 1991-2015, spent some of his first years at CBS News wearing a Pentagon pass.\n\"I came to work for CBS in 1969, and it was shortly after that, they just sent me out to the Pentagon because I was the rookie,\" Schieffer said in a phone interview.\nSchieffer was there for about six years and \"loved it.\"\n\"I'll tell you what I loved about it — it was like covering a small town in the middle of a big city,\" Schieffer said. \"You could get information, and you know, most of the time, it was information that not only helped you, it helped the public understand.\"\n\"They spend a lot of money at the Pentagon and rightly so, but I think people have a right to know about it, and not just get one public relations person who's going to put out a press release.\"\nCurrently, Charlie D'Agata is CBS News' senior national security correspondent covering the Pentagon and brings over two decades of experience covering the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the U.S. military involvement in war zones from Iraq and Afghanistan to Syria.\nBut it's not just the correspondents on camera who are giving up their passes.\nCBS News radio correspondent Cami McCormick has covered national security at CBS for over two decades. And teams of producers, camera operators, audio technicians and engineers crucial to bringing stories of the military to Americans across the country will also be turning in their passes.\nThe Pentagon says the intent of its new policy is to stop press leaks and exercise control over stories about the military reported by CBS News and other media organizations. It sent journalists a memo in September mandating they sign an agreement acknowledging they would need formal authorization to publish either classified or controlled unclassified information.\nThe department said in the memo that \"information must be approved before public release … even if it is unclassified.\" News organizations were given a deadline of 5 p.m. this past Tuesday to return the signed agreement. The vast majority declined to do so, though at least one outlet, the far-right One America News Network, agreed to the new restrictions.\nCBS News Pentagon journalists may have turned in their credentials this week, but losing access to the building isn't going to stop them from reporting what's going on in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth once promised would be \"the most transparent administration ever.\"\nCBS News stories from the Pentagon over the years:\n- \"CBS Evening News\": Battle of Wanat in Afghanistan\n- \"60 Minutes\": The New Cold War\n- \"60 Minutes\": Incoming\n- \"CBS Sunday Morning\": Aftermath\n- \"CBS Evening News\": Caisson horses at Arlington Cemetery\n- \"CBS Evening News\": U.S. troops at southern border\n- CBS News Radio: Broadcast from Pentagon on D-Day",

NHTSA's number for the recall is 25V-686.\nThis is Ford's third rearview camera-related recall this year. Nearly 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles were recalled in May because of a software problem that could cause the rearview camera image to malfunction when the car is in reverse, the NHTSA said. An additional recall in July due to a similar issue involved more than 200,000 vehicles.\nSteering issues\nFord Motor also recalled 115,539 vehicles from its Super Duty truck lineup because of a potential loss of steering issue involving the steering column upper shaft detaching from the steering column. As a result of the defect, drivers may experience a loss of steering control increasing the risk of a crash, the NHTSA said in the notice, dated Sept. 23.\n\"Dealers will inspect the steering column, and repair or replace the upper shaft as necessary, free of charge,\" the recall states.\nThe recall affects certain 2020-2021 F-250 SD, F-350 SD, F-450 SD models.\nLetters notifying owners of the safety risk were mailed Oct. 6, 2025. A final remedy is anticipated to be available December 2025, at which point additional owner letters will be sent.\nFord's number for this recall is 25S94. NHTSA's number for the recall is 25V-626.\nSeatbelt issue\nAn additional recall of 332,778 Ford vehicles involves a seatbelt issue which occurs when a corroded cable breaks, preventing the seat belt from restraining its wearer and putting passengers at an increased risk of injury in the event of a crash, according to a notice from the NHTSA, dated Sept. 12.\nCables can corrode when they interact with water and road salt, impeding the seat belt function.\nThe recall involves certain 2015-2017 Mustang models.\nAs a remedy, dealers are inspecting and replacing the front seat belt cables to make the cars safe, free of charge. Vehicle owners can expect to be notified of the safety risk this month.\nRemedy letters are expected to be sent in January, when a final solution is reached, according to the NHTSA notice.\nFord's number for this recall is 25S92. NHTSA's number for the recall is 25V-614.\nAffected vehicle owners for any of the recalls listed above can contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332; Owners can also contact NHTSA's vehicle safety hotline at 888-327-4236 (TTY 888-275-9171) or go to nhtsa.gov.",

    "body": "Arizona executes man convicted of killing a Phoenix family of 4 in 1993 murders\nA man convicted of killing four members of a Phoenix family over 30 years ago in an act of revenge over stolen goods was put to death Friday in Arizona's second execution of the year.\nRichard Kenneth Djerf, 55, died by lethal injection at 10:40 a.m. local time for the killings of Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna, their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18, and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who was in prison for more than 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.\n\"Those four innocent victims deserve justice, and their loved ones deserve closure,\" said Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, whose office sought the execution.\nProsecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics and a gun from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later, claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.\nAuthorities said Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat, then stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them.\nDjerf declined to make any last statement. He did not put up any resistance but took a few heavy breaths and emitted a brief snoring sound after the lethal drugs were administered, John Barcello, deputy director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, said during a news conference Friday.\nNo representatives of the victims were present, Barcello said.\nMaricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell said in a statement that a case such as Djerf's is a crime where \"justice demands the ultimate punishment.\"\n\"What this man did in 1993, torturing and murdering nearly an entire family, was pure evil,\" Mitchell said. \"Today was a day of final justice — not only for the memory of the four innocent lives he took, but also for the only surviving son and the extended Luna family, who have carried the weight of that loss every single day.\"\nA month ago, Djerf released a statement in which he acknowledged carrying out the killings and apologized for the pain he caused.\nIt took about 10 minutes for the execution team to insert the IV lines into his veins so the drugs could be administered. After the first of two pentobarbital shots were given, he made several sounds, including a grunt and puffing sound. About 15 minutes elapsed between the first pentobarbital shot and the declaration that he was dead.\nBarcello said Djerf's veins \"were not optimal\" and it required a few attempts to successfully place the IV.\n\"By all accounts, the process went according to plan and without any incident,\" Barcello said.\nArizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.\nThe state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.\nThere was a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by difficulties in obtaining the needed drugs and criticism that a 2014 execution was botched: Joseph Wood was injected with 15 doses of a two-drug combination over two hours, leading him to snort repeatedly and gasp hundreds of times before he died.\nExecutions resumed in 2022, and three prisoners were put to death that year. They were paused again in 2023 after Gov. Katie Hobbs ordered a review of the capital punishment protocol and Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to pursue any executions.\nThe review ended in November 2024, when Hobbs fired a retired federal magistrate she had appointed to examine execution procedures, and the state corrections department announced changes in the lethal injection team.\nIn March, 53-year-old Aaron Gunches, who was convicted of murder, was put to death by lethal injection in Arizona. It was the first execution in the southwestern U.S. state in more than two years.\nWith Djerf's execution, there are now 107 prisoners on Arizona's death row.\nHis execution was the fourth in the country this week and the 39th of the year. On Wednesday, a Mississippi man, Charles Crawford, convicted of kidnapping, raping and killing a 20-year-old community college student in 1993, was executed. Alabama inmate Anthony Boyd is scheduled to be executed later this month for a 1993 murder, but he continues to maintain his innocence.\nFive more executions are scheduled in the U.S. this year — two in Florida and one each in Alabama, Oklahoma and Tennessee, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",

The tariffs on parts are also meant to discourage vehicle manufacturers from using only foreign materials.\nThe 25% tariff on all truck imports will apply to all Class 3 to Class 8 vehicles, senior administration officials said on a call with reporters ahead of the signing, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration will also provide a credit for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts into the U.S. so they can make the vehicle in the U.S., in order to offset the tariffs, one of the senior administration officials said.\n\"The idea here is we want to incentivize domestic manufacturing of vehicles, and one way to do that is to say, 'Alright, we understand that not 100% of a vehicle can be used with goods that are already here in the United States,'\" the official said. \"And so, for the parts that do need to be imported, we are essentially allowing a credit so that they can offset any tariff liability that they would accrue because they're importing parts just to manufacture in the United States.\"\nThe credit will depend on what portion of the vehicle's parts are imported.\n\"So we've designed this program to allow automakers who are building things here, like the president wants, that are making their vehicles here with American labor, paying American workers good-paying wages, they are able to continue to be cost competitive and expand production here,\" a second official said.",

    "body": "Gold prices rose to a new record high this week, topping $4,300. Here's why.\nAs economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.\nThe going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.\nGold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad — with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.\nStill, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.\nGold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 — trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.\nSilver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.\nA lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.\nMuch of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike — pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.\nAs a result, hiring has plunged while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.\nThe U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed — and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.\nSeparately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point — and projected it would do so twice more this year.\nInvestments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world — particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\nAnd on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency — with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.\nGold jewelry sticker shock\nMany jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own — sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.\nAt the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore — particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.\nLarger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.\nAdvocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven — arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.\nOf late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.\n\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell recently told CBS News.\nInvestments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\nStill, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.\nNot always a reliable inflation hedge\nCritics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim — and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up — meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\" the commission noted.\nThe frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences — with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.\nMercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people's bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks — putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.\nThe Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world.",

King, the youngest child of King, contacted the company on behalf of his estate.\nAt the estate's request, \"OpenAI has paused generations depicting Dr. King as it strengthens guardrails for historical figures,\" OpenAI and King Estate Inc. said in a joint statement posted on X.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment beyond what the company posted on social media. The King Center, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., also declined additional comment.\nThe tech company launched Sora 2 in September, an AI video generation app that allows users to create hyperrealistic and fantastical content with \"cameos\" of themselves, friends and others who grant permission. It quickly jumped to the top of Apple's app store.\nUsers can control the use of their own likeness on Sora 2. OpenAI, however, has not specified its policy on generating videos with images of deceased people. The company said Thursday that authorized representatives and estate owners can request that a public figure's likeness not be used in Sora 2 videos.\n\"While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,\" OpenAI and King's estate said.\nSora 2 has also stirred controversy after content creators generated a flood of video clips that included copyrighted characters, such as animated TV character SpongeBob Squarepants and Mario from the Nintendo video game. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed the issue in a blog post earlier this month, noting that the company will give copyrights owners \"more granular control over generation of characters.\"",

It was the second clade I case thought to be locally acquired, following a similar report by the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services, also in L.A. County, earlier this week.\nCompared to clade II mpox, which was the cause of the 2022 global outbreak and continued sporadic clusters in the United States, clade I mpox is more likely to cause severe illness and death, health officials say. Fatality rates for clade II range from less than 1% to 4% while rates for clade I range from 1% to 10%, according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Clade II is also not generally seen in children, but clade I is being reported in more children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nAt least six other cases of clade I mpox have been reported in the U.S., including in New York, but they were identified in people who had recently traveled to affected areas in central and eastern Africa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The strain also has been detected in Washington via wastewater testing.\n\"The identification of cases of clade I mpox, which may cause more severe illness than the more common clade II, is concerning,\" Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement Thursday. \"Mpox continues to be spread largely through close, intimate contact with symptomatic people, mainly during sexual activity.\"\nThe health department's release added the virus can be spread through \"close person contact (sex, massage or cuddling) and within households or by sharing personal items.\"\nWhile the risk to the general public remains low, officials are recommending certain groups, including gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men, take preventative measures.\n\"Early detection, testing and vaccination are vital to controlling the spread of this virus,\" Davis said. \"Getting both doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine provides the best protection against mpox.\"\nBoth clade I and clade II may present with flu-like symptoms followed by a rash, officials say. The CDC adds symptoms usually start within 21 days of exposure.\nJohns Hopkins adds rashes for clade I tend to cover more of the body, including face and torso, while rashes from clade II do not always cover the body.",

And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.\n\"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals – they're all encouraging more protein after lifting,\" said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.\nThe protein boom\nProtein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, according to Mintel, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.\nChains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"\nProtein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.\n\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.\nAnsari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.\nBut \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.\nIdeally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.\nConsumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.\n\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"\nFor some people — including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes — protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.\n\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.\nHow much protein is really needed in a diet?\nFor growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.\nGovernment guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein — this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.\n\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"\nByrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.\n\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.\nHigh-protein foods\n\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.\nSome protein-rich foods include:\n- Meats, with options like chicken and turkey leaner than beef\n- Fish and seafood, like tuna, salmon, shrimp and scallops\n- Greek yogurt and cottage cheese\n- Eggs, or egg whites for less cholesterol\n- Milk or soy milk\n- Tofu and tempeh\n- Beans, lentils, chickpeas and edamame\n- Whole grains\nMegan Meyer, a science communication consultant with a doctorate in nutritional immunology, said she aims to have both snacks and meals that include protein.\n\"Some of my favorite protein-rich snacks include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, a handful of nuts, meat sticks and hard-boiled eggs,\" she said. \"My go-to proteins for meals include lean meats like chicken breast, canned tuna, beans, lentils and tofu.\"",

    "body": "How much lead is in your diet? What to know about reducing exposure\nFrom cinnamon to protein powders, reports about high levels of lead in our food are raising questions about how to reduce exposure.\nThis week, a Consumer Reports investigation found some protein powders and shakes contain unsafe levels of lead. The Food and Drug Administration also recently identified four additional makers of ground cinnamon that contain elevated levels of lead, making a total of 16 labels the agency has identified as having concerning amounts of lead.\nThough lead is a naturally occurring metal, it can cause negative health effects, experts warn.\n\"There's lead in the normal environment, that's why we don't want to add more to it,\" Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a general internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, told CBS News. \"It's very important to overall try to keep lead exposure to the lowest possible, based on eating healthy foods and avoiding products like supplements that add unnecessary lead to your diet.\"\nIn addition to contaminated food and drinks, sources of lead exposure also include chipping or peeling lead paint and ingesting or breathing in lead dust from certain jobs or hobbies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nHealth effects of lead\nThe CDC says lead exposure can lead to a range of health problems, especially for children, including:\n- Damage to the brain and nervous system\n- Slowed growth and development\n- Learning and behavior problems\nFor adults, lead can also cause long-term harm, according to the World Health Organization, including:\n- Increased risk of high blood pressure\n- Cardiovascular problems\n- Kidney damage\n\"Lead exposure during pregnancy can cause reduced fetal growth and preterm birth,\" the WHO added.\nHow much lead is too much?\nWhether someone would experience the negative effects of lead depends on the amount of exposure.\n\"If lead builds up for an adult — let's say they're exposed to it not just in the supplements, but also in pottery or other things they're using or eating or maybe at their work site, they're exposed to dust that might contain lead — these things can all add up and absolutely cause problems in adults as well,\" Cohen said.\nOn average, people in the United States take in about six micrograms of lead a day by eating and just going about their lives, Cohen explained.\n\"So for me, anything above six micrograms is a lot,\" he said. The FDA's recommended limit for lead is 8.8 micrograms a day for adults and women of childbearing age, and 2.2 for children.\nThe problem is certain products that aren't regulated by the FDA, like supplements, can contain much higher levels. So if someone is taking these supplements regularly — over weeks, months or years — Cohen said it could build up over time, which is cause for concern.\nCan I test my lead levels?\nWhile there is blood work that can test lead levels, it's not something Cohen would recommend relying on.\n\"It wouldn't prove, for example, that if you had a normal lead level that you weren't getting excessive lead from your supplements,\" he explained, because it could take time before the levels built up to a high enough level to raise concerns to doctors.\n\"We'd really want to try to prevent getting the excess lead before it becomes a clinical problem,\" he said.\nYou can do this by reducing the amount of supplements you take that could contain unknown lead levels. For protein, for example, prioritize whole foods, such as unprocessed or minimally processed meats, eggs, beans and tofu, instead of products that could have unknown ingredients, like protein powders.\nBut if you're not ready to put down the powders, Cohen said you can look for certain third-party testing labels on products to better ensure safety.\nThe United States Pharmacopeia, or USP, for example, is one Cohen considers a high-quality operation.\n\"The majority of these I wouldn't necessarily rely on,\" he said. \"Each of those third-party certification programs can define their own cutoff for lead safety. So if a product were certified by USP, I would trust that it had a safe level of lead, but other third-party certifications, we wouldn't necessarily know how much lead is in the product.\"\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also lists a variety of ways to reduce lead exposure both outside and in your home, from washing food and hands properly to getting professional testing for lead-based materials in your home.",

    "body": "Mental health distress among the nation's LGBTQ+ youth is increasing, study finds\nMental health distress among LGBTQ+ youth in the United States has been increasing amid a surge in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, but strong support networks and access to health care were shown to ease symptoms for some, a study found.\nThe findings were published Thursday by The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services. Researchers followed 1,689 LGBTQ+ young people between the ages of 13 and 24 between September 2023 and March 2025.\nThe study is the first to follow a sample of LGBTQ+ young people over an extended period of time, said Ronita Nath, vice president of research for The Trevor Project.\n\"We know that LGBTQ+ youth are at a significantly higher suicide risk than their cisgender heterosexual peers, but most research only captures their experiences at one point in time, which really limits our understanding of how risk and protective factors play out over months or years,\" Nath told CBS News.\nThe participants of the study were asked to complete a 139 question survey about a range of risk and protective factors on three separate occasions between six month intervals.\nResearchers found mental health distress increased substantially throughout the study's first year. LGBTQ+ youth reporting recent anxiety symptoms rose from 57% to 68%. Those reporting depressive symptoms climbed from 48% to 54%. Suicidal ideation among LGBTQ+ youth grew from 41% to 47%, the data shows.\nThe findings show how experiencing discrimination or support preceded changes in mental health, suggesting they drive rather than coincide with negative or positive health outcomes, Nath said.\nTrevor Project data shows living in an LGBTQ+-affirming home was linked to 37% lower odds of suicidal thoughts. Receiving high support from family was associated with 62% lower odds of suicidal ideation when controlled for age, sexual orientation, gender identity and race/ethnicity.\nData also indicates conversion therapy, or attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, remains a harmful experience for LGBTQ+ youth contributing to mental health distress.\n\"While we may think it's a relic of the past, this data indicates that these dangerous practices are still happening and actually may be on the rise,\" Nath said.\nReports of being threatened with conversion therapy doubled in the first year of the study, and exposure to the practice rose from 9% to 15% among participants.\nLast week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging a Colorado law banning conversion therapy treatments for minors. Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in any practice, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.\nTransgender and nonbinary youth between ages 13 and 17 reported the poorest mental health outcomes. They were twice as likely to report anxiety and suicidal ideation compared to their cisgender peers, a pattern that persisted over the course of the study.\nLegislation restricting legal and medical protections for transgender and nonbinary youth may be contributing to the worsening outcomes, Nath said.\n\"Access to medical, legal, and social supports for gender transition, which includes hormones, puberty blockers, accurate identification documents contributed to improved mental health among transgender and nonbinary youth, which I think highlights the potential harm created by legislation reducing access to transgender health care,\" she said.\nThe ACLU is tracking at least 25 laws passed across the U.S. to limit access to affirming health care for trans youth.\nWhile mental health outcomes worsened, suicide attempts among the LGBTQ+ youth surveyed declined from 11% to 7%. Still, that rate remains higher than national estimates for cisgender heterosexual youth.\n\"LGBTQ+ young people are not inherently prone to higher suicide risk, but that, they're placed at higher suicide risk because of how they're stigmatized and denied support,\" said Nath.\nNath emphasized the overarching takeaway from the study is how support from family and community can affect the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth.\n\"Across all our analysis, supportive family environments, accepting friends, and greater cumulative family support actions all reduce the likelihood of later anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, which really does echo decades of research on the protective power of family acceptance,\" she said.\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can connect to a crisis counselor at The Trevor Project by texting \"START\" to 678-678 or calling 1-866-488-7386.\nFor more information about mental health care resources and support, The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) HelpLine can be reached Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. ET, at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or email info@nami.org.",

    "body": "States jostle over $50 billion rural health fund as Trump's Medicaid cuts trigger scramble\nWashington — Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.\nRather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders — some from as far away as Hawaii.\n\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"\nRural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.\nYet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.\nIt's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.\nApplications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.\nHalf of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.\nThe application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"\nIn September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"\nSmaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.\n\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.\nBut Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.\nOne of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.\nThe company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.\n\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"\nKFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"\nInstead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"\nBrock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"\n\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.\nSlabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money — including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.\nMore than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 — a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.\nState applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.\n\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.\nStates are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.\nIn Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.\n\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.\n\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.\nNeither Montana nor Wyoming — vast, rural states — sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.\nWyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.\nDuring the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.\n\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.\nThe audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.\n\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"\nKFF Health News Montana correspondent Katheryn Houghton contributed to this report.\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

Audible has a 30-day free trial available right now.\nIntroduction\n\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.\nIt was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.\nI'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.\nNaturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.\n\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.\n\"This is Tim Curry.\"\nThat was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.\nI stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that — I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.\nBefore long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.\nUnintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly — a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde — hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.\n\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all — you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.\nI stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.\nShe snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.\nAware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.\n\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"\nI took my passport back and gestured to my friends.\n\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.\nBy definition — as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone — there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.\nBut if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.\nVagabond.\nVagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.\nVagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame — a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.\nThose of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others — because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.\nOf course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.\nIn Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.\nThat part doesn't define me, of course.\nI'm very trustworthy.\nYou believe me, don't you?\nOver the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.\nMuch of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.\nLooking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.\nThat's the vagabond's way.\nAnd yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.\nContrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.\nSo, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn — and my privilege — to malign my own reputation.\nWhy expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.\nMore than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.\nI'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?\nHowever, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts — or at least to hold them at bay.\nToday, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and — with some notable exceptions — enjoy remembering the times I've had.\nYou should know what you're in for, however.\nI'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.\nBefore we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:\nThis will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.\nI must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.\nNor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities — but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.\nI also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am.

If you have ever seen those replies that come in from AI, it's got no soul. It's got no personality.\"\nHe says the questions he gets today are more playful and imaginative.\n\"People are now asking questions that are a little more fun, rather than, 'How hot is the sun?' Stuff you can just look up.\"\nOne example he highlights: \"If aliens came and exploded the moon, what effect would that have on us?\"\nTyson notes that while the moon might not be crucial now, it may have helped early life by creating isolated tide pools. \"Without the moon, astronomers would be very happy, because the sky would be dark all the time,\" he said.\nLikelihood of life elsewhere\nOn the topic of aliens, Tyson is clear about the science and the skepticism.\n\"Everyone that studied the question of life in the universe… would not deny the likelihood of life elsewhere,\" he said. But he doubts they have visited Earth.\n\"We all grew up when no one had cameras, so everything was an eyewitness testimony. Everybody has got a high resolution camera video, and nobody's got some alien walking off their flying saucer.\"\nThe book also dives into quirky scientific curiosities, like how leap years actually work.\n\"So someone said, 'How accurate is the leap year correction?' Because one day every four years, you have a leap day. Turns out, that over corrects. So every 100 years, you have to take away a leap day that would otherwise be there. And that under corrects. Now you have to add a leap day back every 400 years to correct for the other two leap days.\"\nHe even addresses the famous \"Superman\" scene where reversing Earth's rotation supposedly turns back time. Tyson's verdict is blunt: impossible.\n\"Your time is not linked to the rotation of the Earth, they have nothing to do with each other,\" he explained. \"But if he did that, the oceans, which are not attached to the Earth, would have kept moving ... he would have killed a billion people in North and South America.\"\nHis brother, an artist, did the illustrations for the book.\n\"It's a romp through the universe, celebrating people's curiosity,\" Tyson said.\n\"Just Visiting This Planet, Revised and Updated for the Twenty-First Century: Further Scientific Adventures of Merlin from Omniscia,\" goes on sale Tuesday.",

    "body": "Fall foliage colors muted in several regions due to drought\nPortland, Maine — Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.\nSoaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.\nBut dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.\nThat's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.\nIt all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.\n\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"\nDespite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.\nClimate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.\n\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"\nLeaf-peepers undeterred for most part\nThe tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.\nBeckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.\n\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"\nChris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.\n\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.\nLeaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.\nBut there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.\nCrispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.\n\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.\nIn Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.\n\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\"",

The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.\n\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.\nSea ice loss\nBecause all the marine mammals native to the Arctic — seals, whales and polar bears — rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.\nThe three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report — harp, hooded and bearded seals — have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.\nThe same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.\n\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.\nGlobal bird decline\nThe update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.\n\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.\nDeforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.\n\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.\nThe annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.\n\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"\nGreen sea turtles\nOne success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.\nStill, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.\nThe overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.\nAnd even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.\nBut in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"\nExtinct species\nThe latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.\nThree Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species.",

In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"\nThe store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.\nAlso on Tuesday, a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, just outside his house.\nA Spanish tourist on Sunday was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in scenic Shirakawa-go village in central Japan.\nBetween April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.\nThe impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.\nThat depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture, told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.\nJapan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat — which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals.",

The court denied a request from Bryant's lawyers, who asked for a delay because they work with the federal court system and the U.S. government is shut down.\nEarlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review Bryant's death sentence.\nWhile Bryant is being put to death Nov. 14 for one killing, prosecutors said he also shot and killed two other men he was giving rides to as they were reliving themselves on the side of the road during a few weeks that terrorized Sumter County in October 2004.\nBryant will be the 50th person executed in South Carolina since the state restarted the death penalty in 1985 and the seventh inmate put to death in less than 14 months since the state was able to obtain a drug for lethal injection and reopen the death chamber after an unintentional 13-year pause.\nBryant will have until Oct. 31 to choose if he wants to die by lethal injection, firing squad or in the electric chair. Since the long pause, four inmates have chosen lethal injection and two have died by bullets.\nA total of 38 men have been executed so far this year in the U.S., with an inmate scheduled to die Friday by lethal injection in Arizona. At least five other executions are set in the U.S. during the rest of 2025.\nTaunts written in blood on the wall\nBryant admitted to killing Willard \"TJ\" Tietjen after stopping by his secluded home in rural Sumter County and saying he had car trouble.\nTietjen was shot several times. Candles were lit around his body. Someone took a potholder made by his daughter when she was child, dipped the corner in blood and wrote \"victem 4 in 2 weeks. catch me if u can\" on the wall, authorities said.\nTietjen's daughter called him several times, getting more worried when he didn't answer. On the sixth call, she testified a strange voice answered.\nThe person on the other end told her she had the right number. Then she demanded to speak to her father.\n\"And he said 'you can't, I killed him.' And I said, 'this isn't funny, who are you?' He said, 'I'm the prowler.' And I said, 'excuse me, who are you?' He said, 'I'm the prowler,'\" Kimberly Dees testified before a judge who determined Bryant's sentence.\nKillings terrorized a South Carolina county\nProsecutors said Bryant also killed two men — one before and one after Tietjen. He gave the men rides and when they got out to urinate on the side of lonely, rural roads he shot them in the back.\nAs deputies frantically looked for the killer, many of the 100,000 people in Sumter County lived in fear over the random attacks. Officers stopped nearly everyone driving on dirt roads and told people to be leery of anyone they did not know asking for help.\nBryant used drugs to blunt pain from alleged sex abuse\nBryant's lawyers said he was troubled in the months before the killing, begging a probation agent and his aunt to get him help because he couldn't stop thinking about being sexually abused by four male relatives when he was a child.\n\"He was very upset. He looked like he was being tortured. It's like his soul was just laid wide open. In his eyes you could see he was hurting and suffering and he was living the abuse over again as it was coming out,\" aunt Terry Caulder testified.\nBryant tried to help himself through the pain by using meth and smoking joints he sprayed with bug killer, his defense attorneys said.\nPrevious inmates executed have said methods are cruel\nThe six inmates executed in South Carolina since September 2024 have argued the state's methods are cruel and unusual punishments, but have not been able to stop their deaths.\nWith the firing squad, attorneys for the inmates say the three volunteers with rifles nearly missed the heart of the second man killed, Mikal Mahdi. They suggested Mahdi was in agonizing pain for three or four times longer than experts say he would have been if his heart had been hit directly.\nIn contrast, the autopsy on Brad Sigmon, the first man killed by firing squad in the state, showed three distinct bullet wounds and his heart was obliterated, according to Dr. Jonathan Arden, a pathologist hired by attorneys for condemned inmates.\nCondemned inmates have also scrutinized the lethal injection procedures, which appear to now use two doses of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. They said inmates drown in a rush of fluid into their lungs but are paralyzed and cannot react.\nWitnesses to the four executions have not seen any signs of struggle and report the prisoners appear to have lost consciousness in about a minute.\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, South Carolina currently has 29 inmates on death row. No clemencies have ever been granted in the state.\nThe state's longest-serving death row inmate, Fred Singleton, died of natural causes last week at 81 years old.",

So far, just a handful have ever been identified.\nNow, researchers at the University of Mumbai in India, with help from citizen scientists and the world's largest low-frequency radio telescope, have pinpointed \"the most distant and the most powerful ORC known to date,\" according to the London-based Royal Astronomical Society. The group published a study on the new finding in the October issue of its scientific journal, the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nWhile ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.\n\"ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen — and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand,\" Ananda Hota, the founder of the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, a platform where citizen scientists helped spot the ORC, said in a statement.\n\"The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning,\" Pratik Dabhade, of the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, who co-authored the study, said in a separate statement. \"These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities – they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments.\"",

Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.\nThe weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.\nThe ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.\nThe satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.\n\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"\nFinlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.\nThe ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.\nThe satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.\n\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\"",

The booster peeled away and made a controlled entry into the Gulf as planned, with the spacecraft skimming space before descending into the Indian Ocean. Nothing was being recovered.\nIt was the 11th test flight for a full-scale Starship, which Musk intends to use to send people to Mars. NASA's need is more immediate. The space agency cannot land astronauts on the moon by decade's end without the 403-foot Starship, the reusable vehicle meant to get them from lunar orbit down to the surface and back up.\nThe previous test flight in August — a success after a string of explosive failures — followed a similar path with similar goals. More maneuvering was built in this time, especially for the spacecraft. SpaceX planned a series of tests during the spacecraft's entry over the Indian Ocean as practice for future landings back at the launch site.\nLike before, Starship carried up eight mock satellites mimicking SpaceX's Starlinks. The entire flight was meant to last just over an hour, originating from Starbase near the Mexican border.\nSpaceX is modifying its Cape Canaveral launch sites to accommodate Starships, in addition to the much smaller Falcon rockets used to transport astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA.",

    "body": "Notable Deaths in 2025\nA look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.\nShe excelled at comedy and drama, starring in such acclaimed films as \"Annie Hall,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"Manhattan\" and \"Reds.\" But Academy Award-winning actress Diane Keaton (Jan. 5, 1946-Oct. 11, 2025) constantly upended expectations, whether it was her love of playing \"jerks\" (as she called them), or her work as a director, photographer, and fashion icon.\nShe was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, and after acting and singing in school and college productions, she dropped out and headed to New York, where she studied under Sanford Meisner. She ended up taking her mother's maiden name (since Actors Equity already had a Diane Hall registered).\nAt 22, Keaton made her Broadway debut in the musical \"Hair.\" She then met Woody Allen at an audition for his comedy \"Play It Again, Sam\"; they appeared together on stage and in the 1972 film version, directed by Herbert Ross. And in Keaton, Woody Allen found his foil. The two teamed up for his 1973 sci-fi comedy \"Sleeper,\" and the 1975 comedy \"Love and Death.\" \"I just liked being his stupid sidekick,\" Keaton told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"I loved it. He would say things like, 'You can't even do a joke?' And he's right, so he was very smart about it. And then he would, like, have me set up the joke for him. That's what I'm good at – being the idiot!\"\nTheir pairing in \"Annie Hall,\" a comic masterpiece about the end of a couple's love affair, fixed Keaton in the public imagination as a woman of spirit, quirks, intelligence and humor. It was filmed two years after she and Allen had ended their romantic relationship. Yet, she wrote in her memoir \"Then Again,\" that – as natural as her performance in \"Annie Hall\" appeared – the story was not simply a recreation of their relationship: \"My last name is Hall. Woody and I did share a significant romance, according to me, anyway. I did want to be a singer. I was insecure, and I did grope for words.\" She won the Oscar for best actress, in the same year she was praised for her dramatic performance in \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar.\"\nKeaton and Allen would reteam for \"Manhattan,\" \"Radio Days\" and \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" and the drama \"Interiors.\" But before Allen had made her a comedic treasure, Keaton became a star in her second feature film. She said she did not know why she was cast to play the wife of Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather.\" \"I would always fail,\" she said of auditions, \"because they would always say to me, 'You're too kooky.' And so you don't get the part because you're too 'kooky,' because I was a little off-center - Oh, you're making fun. Oh that's really not nice! - but, yeah, I felt I was miscast.\"\nShe didn't quite feel that way once she saw the finished film. \"The only thing I thought about it, when I saw me – not the movie, the movie is absolutely brilliant – was, the wig is horrible!\" she laughed.\nThe film and its sequels also offered her the opportunity to work with Al Pacino, with whom she developed a long-term, on-and-off relationship. She was also involved with Warren Beatty, who directed her in his epic \"Reds,\" in which she played journalist Louise Bryant.\nKeaton's films in the 1980s, '90s and 2000s were a remarkable mix of dramas and comedies. She starred in the family dramas \"Shoot the Moon\" and \"Marvin's Room,\" the John Le Carré thriller \"The Little Drummer Girl,\" and the romantic drama \"Mrs. Soffel.\" Then, she played for laughs in \"Crimes of the Heart,\" \"Baby Boom,\" \"The First Wives Club,\" the \"Father of the Bride\" films, \"Sister Mary Explains It All,\" \"Morning Glory,\" \"The Family Stone,\" \"Book Club,\" \"And So It Goes,\" and \"Something's Gotta Give,\" which earned Keaton her fourth Academy Award nomination.\nShe also directed the documentary \"Heaven\"; episodes of \"China Beach,\" \"Twin Peaks\" and \"Pasadena\"; the CBS Schoolbreak Special \"The Girl With the Crazy Brother\"; a Belinda Carlisle music video; and the features \"Hanging Up\" and \"Unstrung Heroes.\"\nHer bestselling books included the memoirs \"Then Again\" and \"Brother & Sister\"; \"Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty\"; \"Saved: My Picture World,\" a photography collection; and \"Fashion First.\"\nKeaton never married, and didn't start a family until she was in her fifties, when she adopted a daughter, Dexter, and, five years later, a son, Duke.\nKeaton was the recipient of an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 2017, and in 2022 she added her own hand and footprints to those outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. \"I don't think about my film legacy,\" she said then. \"I'm just lucky to have been here at all in any way, shape or form. I'm just fortunate. I don't see myself anything other than that.\"\nJane Goodall\nThrough her groundbreaking observations while living among chimpanzees in the jungles of Tanzania, anthropologist and conservationist Jane Goodall (April 3, 1934-Oct. 1, 2025) transformed the study of the animal world after witnessing chimps fashioning and using tools, which at the time was believed to be unique to humans. Her field research also documented the distinct personalities of the chimps she studied. Through her books, articles, documentary films and public appearances over six decades, Goodall changed how the world perceived homo sapien's closest relative in all their emotional and social complexity.\nHer fascination with animals began in childhood, spending hours in a tree reading \"Tarzan.\" \"There was no TV back then,\" Goodall told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"That's when my dream began. I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it. No intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"\nWorking in Nairobi as an assistant to Louis Leakey, the paleoanthropologist raised money for Goodall to spend six months studying chimpanzees in the Gombe rain forest in Tanzania bringing her \"fresh pair of eyes and fiery spirit,\" she said. \"I clearly was passionate. I clearly had an understanding of animals. And he felt that women might be better in the field, that we might be more patient. Also, he wanted somebody who hadn't been to college, so he wanted an unbiased mind.\"\nLiving among the chimpanzees, she eventually gained the animals' trust. She witnessed chimps fashioning and using tools — using twigs to fish for termites. She also detected chimps having distinct personalities and share \"human\" emotions, like pleasure, sadness and fear. She documented the bond between mother and child, and sibling rivalry. \"A lot of people refused to believe it,\" Goodall said. \"Why should they believe this young girl? She hadn't even been to college!\"\nBut National Geographic sent cameraman Hugo van Lawick, and his film corroborated her findings. He also photographed Goodall — and became her husband.\nShe later founded the Jane Goodall Institute, and devoted decades of her life to education about and advocacy for protecting the environment. She gave lectures and toured; she was typically on the road 300 days a year, and was in California on a speaking tour when she died.\nFour years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap? Why is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? … If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all. You know, even if you just pick one thing, like eating less meat. Just do something.\"\nClaudia Cardinale\nItalian actress Claudia Cardinale (April 15, 1938-Sept. 23, 2025) starred in more than 100 films and TV productions, and was best known for her roles in Federico Fellini's \"8½,\" and Luchino Visconti's \"The Leopard.\" She was also a U.N. goodwill ambassador for women's rights.\nThe daughter of Sicilian parents, her career began after winning a beauty pageant in Tunisia at age 17. That led to a trip to the Venice Film Festival, and offers to appear in movies. She turned them down, at first. \"It's like a man,\" she told The Guardian in 2013. \"When he's going after you, if you say yes immediately, after a little time he goes away. If you say no, he desires you for a long time.\"\nOften compared to Brigitte Bardot, Cardinale found success working with such directors as Mario Monicelli (\"Big Deal on Madonna Street\"), Luchino Visconti (\"Rocco and His Brothers,\" \"The Leopard,\" \"Conversation Piece\"), Sergio Leone (\"Once Upon a Time in the West\") and Werner Herzog (\"Fitzcarraldo\").\nShe appeared in some Hollywood productions, including \"The Pink Panther\" with Peter Sellers, \"Circus World\" with John Wayne, \"Don't Make Waves\" with Tony Curtis, and \"The Professionals\" with Burt Lancaster. But she refused to sign exclusivity contracts with American studios, and so the majority of her appearances were in international films.\nA staple of Italian and French cinema, she continued working into her 80s. Of her roles, which extended from the sultry to the grand dame, she proudly said in 2013, \"I was never naked and I never did anything to change my face. I don't like that at all. I like to be what I am, because you cannot stop time.\"\nSonny Curtis\nSongwriter, musician and Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Sonny Curtis (May 9, 1937-Sept. 19, 2025) was an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly, and wrote such popular hits as \"I Fought the Law,\" \"Walk Right Back,\" and the theme song of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\"\nBorn in West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\" But he started dreaming up songs while working the fields: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"\nWhen he was 14 he met young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock, and the two started playing guitars together. They became fast friends and formed a band, all while absorbing the music that would shape rock 'n' roll, from Lead Belly and Little Richard to Ray Charles. They wound up opening for Elvis Presley when the entertainer came to town in 1956.\nThe band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money. So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman, while Holly formed a new band, The Crickets. \"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis told \"Sunday Morning.\"\nHe would serve as a pallbearer after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 at age 22. Curtis joined The Crickets, while his songs were recorded by the likes of the Everly Brothers, Bobby Goldsboro, Andy Williams, Ricky Skaggs, and The Clash.\nIn 1970, while he was writing commercial jingles, he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it,\" he said.\nHe was asked to write a theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' … 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"\nWithin hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to demo his song for producer James L. Brooks. \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him,\" Curtis recalled. \"He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"\nBut when it came time to record it, he said, \"As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"\nRobert Redford\nAcademy Award-winning actor-director Robert Redford (Aug. 18, 1936-Sept. 16, 2025) was one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen. His startlingly-magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were,\" \"The Sting\" and \"All the President's Men,\" and his nonchalance about his striking good looks, made him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.\nHe became as well known for founding the Sundance Institute, using his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985 the institute hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen Brothers, Ryan Coogler and Jordan Peele, and for such audience favorites as \"Sex, Lies and Videotape,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild,\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\" In 1989 the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"\nYet, according to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable. \"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid opposite Paul Newman, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul.\"\nHis performance changed all that. Four years later, Redford and Newman re-teamed in Hill's Oscar-winning caper, \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).\nRedford's remarkable screen presence was a highlight of a slew of pictures: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda, and \"Brubaker.\"\nBut his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama, \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal. \"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"'You know, Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work [which] led to something that spared us the loss of our first amendment. That to me is worth making.\"\nRedford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"\nHe moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself — behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People,\" starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. The film won best picture, best supporting actor for Timothy Hutton (in his film debut), and best director for Redford.\nWhile he continued appearing on screen (\"The Natural,\" \"Out of Africa\" with Meryl Streep, \"Legal Eagles,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Truth,\" \"All Is Lost,\" \"A Walk in the Woods,\" \"The Old Man & the Gun\"), he returned to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"\nMeanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its eponymous film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January, and to its workshops and screenwriting labs.\nIn 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot:\" \"There's only the trying. The rest is not our business. It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"\nGiorgio Armani\nThe clothes designed by Giorgio Armani (July 11, 1934-Sept. 4, 2025) very much reflected relaxed elegance – a supercool attitude that blurred divisions between men's and women's clothing. Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.\nArmani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.\nBorn in Piacenza, Italy, Armani's was a childhood ravaged by World War II, his family's home destroyed by bombs. Though he hadn't dreamed of a career in design, a temporary job in a department store made him realize he had a knack. Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.\nIn 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman who became his partner in work and in life. Galeotti encouraged Armani to begin designing on his own.\nArmani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s. His liningless sports jacket, paired with a T-shirt, was an instant success, while his women's pantsuit was revolutionary. He landed on the cover of Time magazine, and his clothes found their way into countless films (including \"American Gigolo\"), and on the red carpet.\nAfter the death of Galeotti in 1985, Armani continued the company, building it into a $10 billion empire encompassing not just fashion but also home design, bars and restaurants, perfumes, cosmetics, and even a basketball team, Olympia Milano.\nA perfectionist, Armani would worry about every detail, no matter how small. When asked what he felt when releasing a new collection, Armani replied, \"I am terrified.\"\nTerence Stamp\nThe magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"\nBorn in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.\nAt a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.\nHis performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.\nHis film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.\nHe published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"\nIn 1987, Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\"\nJames Lovell\nWhen astronaut James Lovell (March 25, 1928-Aug. 7, 2025) was launched aboard Apollo 8, just four days before Christmas 1968, NASA's flight director believed they only had a 50% chance of coming home safely. \"Some of the odds of trying to be successful in that mission are overwhelming, and perhaps at that time we didn't even understand what the odds were,\" Lovell told \"CBS Evening News\" in 2018.\nThat Christmas Eve, they became the first human crew to circle the moon. \"We're like three schoolkids looking into a candy store window, watching those ancient old craters on the far side, slowly slip underneath us,\" Lovell told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018.\nBut the truly moving sight was when they viewed their home planet rise above the surface. \"I could put my thumb up to the window, and completely hide the Earth,\" Lovell said. \"You have to think about that – over five billion people, everything I ever knew, was behind my thumb!\"\nA U.S. Naval Academy graduate and test pilot, Lovell joined the space program in 1962, becoming one of NASA's most traveled astronauts during its first decade. Lovell flew into space four times: aboard Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13.\nIt was that last mission, in 1970, that proved the most harrowing. Apollo 13's service module, carrying Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" Swigert and Lovell radioed.\nWith the landing mission scrapped, Lovell and his crewmates moved into the cramped lunar lander to use as a lifeboat, as hundreds of flight controllers and engineers worked to guide the damaged spacecraft back home. With the crew's life support dwindling, the world watched gripped in suspense over their four-day journey back to Earth.\nLovell's calm demeanor during the mission (which was dramatized in the film \"Apollo 13,\" starring Tom Hanks) fixed his public image, underscoring the heroism of astronauts working in the deadly environment of space. Though disappointed he never got to walk on the moon, Lovell understood that, in some ways, the failed mission was a success. \"Going to the moon, if everything works right, it's like following a cookbook. It's not that big a deal,\" he told the AP in 2004. \"If something goes wrong, that's what separates the men from the boys.\"\nLoni Anderson\nShe was originally hired to play a \"dumb blonde\" receptionist on the CBS sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati,\" but actress Loni Anderson (Aug. 5, 1945-Aug. 3, 2025) wanted something different. \"I liked the show, but I didn't like the role, and so I refused,\" she told Australia's Studio 10 in 2019, describing the character of Jennifer Marlowe as window dressing. When asked how she would do it, Anderson replied, \"Let's make her look like Lana Turner and be the smartest person in the room.\" Blonde, but not dumb.\nAnderson starred on \"WKRP\" from 1978 to 1982, playing a receptionist whose efficiency kept the sagging station up and running. The role earned her two Emmy nominations and three Golden Globe nominations.\nA native of St. Paul, Minnesota, Anderson's first film role was an uncredited appearance in the Steve McQueen western \"Nevada Smith\" (playing a brunette bar girl). She guest-starred on such TV series as \"S.W.A.T.,\" \"Police Woman,\" \"Phyllis,\" \"Police Story,\" \"Barnaby Jones,\" \"The Bob Newhart Show\" and \"The Incredible Hulk.\"\nFollowing \"WKRP,\" Anderson starred in the series \"Partners in Crime,\" \"Easy Street,\" \"Nurses,\" and \"My Sister Is So Gay,\" and the TV movies \"The Jayne Mansfield Story,\" \"A Letter to Three Wives,\" \"Blown Away,\" \"Sorry, Wrong Number,\" and \"White Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd.\" She co-starred with Burt Reynolds (who later became her third husband) in \"Stroker Ace,\" and appeared in \"A Night at the Roxbury.\"\nIn the early 1990s she returned to the role of Jennifer Marlowe in \"The New WKRP in Cincinnati.\"\nIn her 1995 autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels,\" Anderson wrote about her marriage and tabloid divorce involving Reynolds, describing the growth of \"a woman who survives.\"\nTom Lehrer\nTom Lehrer (April 9, 1928-July 26, 2025) was a math prodigy (earning a Harvard degree at age 18), and was perhaps the only mathematician with a recording contract. But while he was teaching at Harvard and MIT, he was best known to the public as a musical satirist, recording songs in the 1950s and '60s about politics, marriage, race, religion, the Boy Scouts, the Cold War and the environment. His ditties included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler,\" \"Be Prepared,\" and \"The Vatican Rag,\" while \"I Got It From Agnes\" hinted at the spread of a sexually-transmitted disease among his friends (and his audience). He also wrote holiday music, such as \"(I'm Spending) Hanukkah in Santa Monica.\"\nLehrer began penning comic songs and performing them in revues at Harvard, and made his first record, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" in 1953. In addition to mocking current events, he also mocked musical styles. His song \"The Elements\" mimicked a melody of Gilbert & Sullivan's to list the periodic table.\nHis 1959 live recording, \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" was nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical).\nHe also contributed songs to the satirical TV news series \"That Was the Week That Was,\" the BBC's \"The Frost Report,\" and \"The Electric Company,\" and his music became the basis of an Off-Broadway revue, \"Tomfoolery.\"\nLehrer largely abandoned his moonlighting music career to return to teaching math; he was on the faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz into his late 70s. However, long after he'd stopped touring, his recordings earned another life via Dr. Demento's long-running radio show, inspiring artists such as \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. And while his body of work was quite small — fewer than 100 songs — they filled out several compilations, including a box set, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer.\"\nIn 2020, he relinquished his copyright to his songs, granting the public permission to use them in any format. Posting the lyrics and sheet music online, he wrote, \"Help yourselves, and don't send me any money.\"\nIn a 2015 Library of Congress interview he was asked about the longevity of his \"Songs by Tom Lehrer\" recording: \"One of the reasons for its appeal is that it's simple: just piano and voice. Most records are 'produced' by someone, but I didn't even know what a record producer was. That may be one of the reasons that children like it, even if they don't understand it. I heard that Joan Baez — whom I've never met — was asked in an interview if she sang lullabies to her baby. She said that doesn't work, but she sings 'The Old Dope Peddler' to him and he goes right to sleep.\"\nCleo Laine\nBritish singer Dame Cleo Laine (Oct. 28, 1927-July 24, 2025) possessed one of the most distinctive voices in jazz. She used her remarkable four-octave vocal range not just for jazz but also for pop, Broadway and opera.\nBorn Clementina Dinah Campbell, she had piano, voice and dance lessons as a child, performing from as young as age 3. For years after leaving school, she faced rejections from singing auditions, until 1951, when she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven. As Dankworth recalled for \"Sunday Morning\" in 1990, \"We were just completely overwhelmed, because there was a finished article — a singer who sung like herself and didn't sing like a watered-down version of Ella Fitzgerald or Doris Day or whatever it may be.\"\nIn 1958, a year after divorcing her first husband, Laine married Dankworth — and quit the band. But he continued as her manager, and Laine moved on from London cabarets to concert halls around the world.\nLaine was never pigeonholed, embracing music of virtually every style, from a Kurt Weill opera, to an album of Shakespearean sonnets, to Jerome Kern's \"Show Boat\" and Stephen Sondheim's \"Into The Woods.\" The 1986 album \"Cleo at Carnegie\" won her a Grammy Award; that same year, she earned a Tony nomination for \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\"\nLaine and Dankworth also founded a camp in Wovendun, outside of London, as a school for musicians. There, they shared lessons from their long careers. As Laine remarked to one young singer, \"Don't ever copy anybody. Find your flaws, if you like, and work on them and make them part of you. Dismiss. Listen to them, learn, take bits, like the drama of it or the technical ability or whatever, but not their sounds. I beg of you, don't do that, and you'll go far.\"\nOzzy Osbourne\nSinger Ozzy Ozbourne (Dec. 3, 1948-July 22, 2025) was a founding member and frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, who later became a demonic solo act — as well as the frontman of an MTV reality series starring his family, \"The Osbournes.\"\nGrowing up in Birmingham, England, John Michael Osbourne — a fan of The Four Seasons, Chuck Berry, Little Richard and The Beatles — teamed up with bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as part of a group that called itself the Polka Tulk Blues Band. The four then reconstituted as Black Sabbath, taking the name from an Italian horror movie. The group released five albums in four years, including their debut, \"Black Sabbath\" (recorded in two days), \"Paranoid,\" \"Master of Reality,\" \"Vol. 4\" and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\" The music was industrial, with guitar jams, drum riffs, and dramatically shifting tempos that propulsed a screaming Osbourne to rail and wail about war, the establishment, religion, skinheads and drugs. Only the singles \"Paranoid\" and \"Iron Man\" charted, but the albums themselves all went platinum.\nOsbourne's excesses, such as missing gigs and rehearsals, got him fired from the group, and so he began a solo career, releasing \"Blizzard of Ozz\" in 1980. Twelve more studio albums followed.\nAmong his hits were \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again,\" \"Bark at the Moon,\" \"Shot in the Dark,\" \"Mama, I'm Coming Home,\" \"Road to Nowhere,\" \"See You on the Other Side,\" \"Back on Earth,\" \"Gets Me Through,\" \"I Don't Wanna Stop,\" \"Let Me Hear You Scream,\" and \"Under the Graveyard.\"\nHe was inducted twice into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame — first with Black Sabbath in 2006, and again as a solo artist in 2024.\nIn 2002, MTV debuted \"The Osbournes,\" a reality show which offered a glimpse behind the heavy metal singer's public image: that of a sweet-natured husband to Sharon, ingesting Diet Cokes and admonishing his kids, Kelly and Jack, from smoking or drinking. While he continued to release albums and make appearances, he was hobbled by injuries from a bike accident (requiring multiple surgeries) and a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.\nOn July 5, 2025, in Birmingham, the original Black Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years for what Osbourne said would be his final concert — a tribute that assembled musicians from Aerosmith, Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Alice in Chains and others. Weeks before his farewell concert (a charity event dubbed \"Back to the Beginning\"), Osbourne told The Guardian that he was ready to hang it up: \"I don't smoke dope or do any of the rock star lifestyle any more. I'm kind of like a homebody. I never go out. I never hang out in bars — I don't drink. So what the **** is out there for me? I hate going shopping with my wife. I feel like stabbing myself in the neck after half an hour. But it's time for me to spend some time with my grandkids. I don't want to die in a hotel room somewhere. I want to spend the rest of my life with my family.\"\nChuck Mangione\nTwo-time Grammy-winning musician Chuck Mangione (Nov. 29, 1940-July 22, 2025) achieved international success in 1977 with his jazz-flavored single \"Feels So Good.\" The flugelhorn and trumpet player released more than 30 albums during a career that included composing music for the closing ceremony of the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid.\nA graduate of the Eastman School of Music (where he would return as director of the school's jazz ensemble), Chuck originally partnered with his brother, pianist Gap Mangione, as The Jazz Brothers, performing in the style of be-bop artists like Dizzy Gillespie. After a few albums, the brothers went their own ways. Chuck played with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, before headlining 25 albums.\nHe won a Grammy in 1977 for the album \"Bellavia.\" He earned his second Grammy, and a Golden Globe nomination for best original score, for the movie \"The Children of Sanchez.\"\n\"Our music has been criticized and knocked for this or that,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 1987. \"People say we are a jazz group, people say we're not a jazz group; and I think one of the hippest things that people have said to me is that, through our music, we become a steppingstone for them to get into the more sophisticated music of the Zen masters of jazz, like the Monks and the Dizzys and other people, because that kind of music is not something that's instantly palatable by everybody.\"\nMalcolm-Jamal Warner\nFor eight seasons actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner (Aug. 18, 1970-July 20, 2025) played Theo Huxtable, the only son of Bill Cosby's Cliff Huxtable, on the top-rated \"The Cosby Show,\" earning an Emmy Award nomination. He also appeared in a spin-off series starring Lisa Bonet, \"A Different World.\"\nWarner was only 14 when \"Cosby Show\" started, but as he explained to CBS News in 2014, he already had a mature outlook about his life and blossoming career. \"When the show first came out, out of the box it was a phenomenal success and my mom sat me down and basically said, 'Baby, it's great that this show is doing so well, but this show could be over next year. What are you going to do when the show's over?' So, she really impressed upon thinking about beyond … however long the show runs.\"\nWarner maintained a rich career post-\"Cosby Show.\" He starred in the series \"Here and Now,\" \"Malcolm & Eddie,\" \"Jeremiah,\" \"Listen Up,\" \"The Resident,\" and \"Read Between the Lines\" (opposite Tracee Ellis Ross). He also appeared on \"Sons of Anarchy\" and \"Suits,\" and played O.J. Simpson's friend Al Cowlings on \"American Crime Story.\" His film and TV movie roles included \"The Tuskegee Airmen,\" \"The List,\" and \"Fool's Gold.\" His stage appearances include \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" in the role made famous by Sidney Poitier. He also directed episodes of \"Cosby Show,\" \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" \"Kenan & Kel,\" \"Malcolm & Eddie,\" and others.\nA poet and musician, Warner won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance (for \"Jesus Children\"), and was nominated for best spoken word poetry album (\"Hiding in Plain View\").\nIn 2015, Warner told The Associated Press that the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby \"tarnished\" the show's legacy. (Cosby's conviction was later overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.)\n\"My biggest concern is when it comes to images of people of color on television and film,\" Warner said. \"We've always had 'The Cosby Show' to hold up against that. And the fact that we no longer have that, that's the thing that saddens me the most, because in a few generations the Huxtables will have been just a fairy tale.\"\nFelix Baumgartner\nTempting death was no small matter for extreme athlete Felix Baumgartner (April 20, 1969-July 17, 2025), who once leaped from 24 miles above Earth, on the very edge of space, to complete the world's first supersonic skydive.\nOn Oct. 14, 2012 — the 65th anniversary of Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier — Baumgartner became the first human to break the sound barrier in a high-altitude free-fall parachute jump. Wearing a pressurized suit and jumping out of a capsule carried aloft by a helium balloon, Baumgartner reached a maximum speed of 843.6 mph (faster than Mach 1) during a nine-minute descent, before opening his chute about 5,000 feet above the New Mexico desert.\nAt one point during his jump, Baumgartner went into a 13-second spin while still supersonic.\nAfterwards he said, \"When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you do not think about breaking records anymore, you do not think of about gaining scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.\"\nBorn in Austria, \"Fearless Felix,\" a former military parachutist, skydiver and BASE jumper, was part of the Red Bull Stratos team. He jumped from skyscrapers, flew across the English Channel in a carbon fiber wing, and leapt from the hand of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil. In recent years, he performed as a helicopter stunt pilot.\nBaumgartner's altitude record was broken two years later by Google executive Alan Eustace, who made a free-fall jump from 135,890 feet (or 25.7 miles). But of his own freefall from the stratosphere, Baumgartner said, \"Sometimes we have to get really high to see how small we are.\"\nAlan Bergman\nLyricist Alan Bergman (Sept. 11, 1925-July 17, 2025) shared three Academy Awards, four Emmys and two Grammys with his wife, Marilyn Bergman. Together they created enduring hits for such artists as Frank Sinatra (\"Nice 'n' Easy\"), Dean Martin (\"Sleep Warm\"), Ray Charles (\"In the Heat of the Night\"), Peggy Lee (\"Pieces of Dreams\"), Charley Pride (\"All His Children\"), Diane Krall (\"Soldiers in the Rain\"), and the Barbra Streisand-Neil Diamond duet \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers.\"\nThey won two Grammys and an Oscar for their music for the Streisand-Robert Redford romance \"The Way We Were,\" and won two more Oscars for \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" (from \"The Thomas Crown Affair\"), and for the song score of \"Yentl.\" Their 13 additional Academy Award nominations included music for \"The Happy Ending\" (the song \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\"), \"The Promise,\" \"Tootsie,\" \"Best Friends,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"Sabrina.\"\nThey collaborated with such composers as Michel Legrand, Marvin Hamlisch, Quincy Jones, John Williams, Henry Mancini, and Cy Coleman. The Bergmans also wrote lyrics for the Broadway musical \"Ballroom,\" and composed TV theme songs for \"Maude,\" \"Good Times,\" and \"Alice.\"\nIn 2010 the Bergmans described their creative partnership to \"Sunday Morning\": \"It's pitching and catching,\" said Alan. \"One is the creator and the other is the editor, and those roles change within seconds. We find that those words have to sit on those notes just right so, you know, so that they sing.\"\nBut balancing work and marriage was more delicate, said Marilyn, like \"the way porcupines make love: carefully … The secret of a good collaboration is the secret of a marriage. They're the same things. There has to be respect. There has to be trust. You have to really like each other.\"\nConnie Francis\nPop star Connie Francis (Dec. 12, 1937-July 16, 2025) had more than a dozen Top 20 hits, including \"Who's Sorry Now?,\" \"Lipstick on Your Collar,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Where the Boys Are.\"\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, she began appearing on stage at age 3. Signed by MGM Records, her 1957 cover of \"Who's Sorry Now?,\" promoted by Dick Clark on \"American Bandstand,\" hit #4 on the charts. She told Billboard magazine earlier this year that she hadn't wanted to record the standard, but did so at the insistence of her father. It nonetheless offered her a creativity she hadn't experienced before: \"By the time I was 14, I did demonstration records, and a publisher would say, 'Connie, give us some of that great Patti Page sound, give me some of that great Kay Starr sound, give me some of that great Teresa Brewer sound.' I didn't have a style of my own yet. But on 'Who's Sorry Now,' I was so turned off on the song that I didn't try to imitate anybody else. I just sounded like myself for the first time. And it was a hit.\"\nShe followed with \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" \"My Happiness,\" \"Lipstick on Your Collar,\" \"Frankie,\" \"Among My Souvenirs,\" \"Mama,\" \"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own,\" \"Many Tears Ago,\" \"Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart,\" \"Together,\" \"(He's My) Dreamboat,\" \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You,\" \"Second Hand Love,\" \"Vacation,\" \"I Was Such as Fool (to Fall in Love With You),\" \"I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter,\" and \"Follow The Boys\" – all in a six-year period.\n\"Where the Boys Are,\" the theme song of her 1960 film debut (in which she played a student on spring break in Florida), was written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield. Francis also recorded versions in other languages (including Italian, Spanish, German and Japanese), which topped the charts in several other countries.\nBut despite having 16 gold records before she turned 25, Francis' 1984 autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?,\" touched on much of the sadness and tragedy she experienced, such as the breakup of her romance with singer Bobby Darin (Francis' disapproving father pulled a gun on him). She was married four times (three marriages each lasted less than a year). A baby boy died after 10 days, and she had two miscarriages. A friend of hers was murdered in her home in 1967. Her singing voice was dramatically affected by cosmetic surgery.\nIn 1974, while appearing at the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island, a man broke into her hotel room and raped her at knifepoint. The fallout of the attack halted her singing career, ended her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil. And in 1983 her father had her committed to a Florida psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point, Francis swallowed dozens of sleeping tablets, but recovered after three days in a coma.\n\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told the Associated Press in 1984.\nBut after her brother was shot to death in 1981, she reached an epiphany — that her damaged voice was still golden. She returned to performing, making a comeback at the Westbury Music Fair, seven years after the rape. ″I don't want people to feel sorry for me,″ she told The New York Times just before her Westbury concert. ″I have my voice, a gift from God I took for granted before. He gave it back to me.″\nIn early 2025, seven years after she retired, her recording of \"Pretty Little Baby\" became a social media sensation, streamed 10 billion times on TikTok. \"I'm flabbergasted,\" she said of the response. \"To think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me.\"\nMartin Cruz Smith\nBestselling author Martin Cruz Smith (Nov. 3, 1942-July 11, 2025) was a reporter briefly after college, and also worked as a Good Humor man. \"That was the best,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002. \"I discovered that one other thing I could do besides sell stories was sell Popsicles.\"\nHe wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.\nAn international blockbuster, it inspired a film starring William Hurt. But the Soviets were not amused; Smith was blacklisted from the U.S.S.R. \"I could not get back in at that point. I was persona non grata,\" he said.\nBut he worked his way onto a Soviet factory ship in the Bering Sea and somehow charmed the captain. Smith's brief stay aboard the Sulak, out of Vladivostok. became the basis of his sequel to \"Gorky Park,\" \"Polar Star.\"\nArkady Renko would make appearances in a total of 10 novels, including \"Red Square,\" \"Havana Bay,\" \"Wolves Eat Dogs,\" \"Stalin's Ghost,\" \"Three Stations,\" \"Tatiana,\" \"The Siberian Dilemma,\" and \"Independence Square.\" What was billed as the final Renko novel, \"Ukraine Square,\" was published in July.\nSmith worked to keep himself interested as a writer because, he said, \"writing is so boring. I mean, you're up there alone, nobody's there, and sometimes you kind of swivel round just to see if anybody showed up, and no one ever shows up; it's just you. So, you know, if you aren't really fascinated by it, it's not going to happen.\"\nHe abandoned his Russian hero for long periods over the years to tackle other characters and settings (including in \"Stallion Gate,\" \"Rose,\" and \"The Girl From Venice\"), but kept going back, in part to reflect on the changes in Russia between Brezhnev and Putin. While he was preparing for the release of his \"December 6\" — a non-Renko novel set in Tokyo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor — Smith said he could feel the presence of his most famous character lurking over his shoulder: \"You know, I can feel him sort of pacing; you know, smoking cigarettes and pacing … 'When is he going to be done with this Japanese book and we can get back to work?'\"\nDavid Gergen\nPresidential aide and political commentator David Gergen (May 9, 1942-July 10, 2025) worked as an adviser to four presidents, both Republican and Democrat, in a career spanning decades in government, academia and media. Asked in 2022 by \"Sunday Morning\" about having served presidents of different parties, he said, \"If you wanna see the results, I can show you the scars on my back!\"\nBorn in North Carolina, Gergen graduated from Yale University and Harvard Law School. A Navy veteran, he became a speechwriting assistant for Richard Nixon in 1971. He also worked in the Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations, as a communications director, and counselor to the president, among other roles.\nA bipartisan voice in a partisan town, he became a Washington legend for his clear and steady appraisal of the times during critical moments in U.S. history. In 1999 he founded the Harvard Kennedy School's Center for Public Leadership. He also worked as an editor at U.S. News & World Report, taught at Duke University, and was a senior political analyst for CNN and on PBS, where he joined in weekly discussions with columnist Mark Shields.\nHe talked with \"Sunday Morning\" about the evolving notion of leadership, reflected in a photograph of President John F. Kennedy leaning over his desk. \"That Kennedy [image] really was the Great Man Theory, you know, in a picture. It's sort of at dusk, lonely figure, the burden of the world on his shoulders. Look at Obama: from my point of view, the iconic picture of the Obama presidency is when he's down in the Situation Room, we're closing in on Osama [bin Laden], and there are all these people surrounding him, all of his advisors. We've moved from a singular person theory of leadership to a more collective action. A constructive collaboration becomes essential in a really complicated world that's moving so quickly.\"\nMichael Madsen\nActor Michael Madsen (Sept. 25, 1957-July 3, 2025) was best known for his standout performances in the films of Quentin Tarantino — projecting menace and insouciance with a chaser of violence, in \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Kill Bill: Volumes I and II,\" and \"The Hateful Eight.\"\nMadsen, the brother of actress Virginia Madsen, acquired more than 300 film and TV credits, including \"Diner,\" \"WarGames,\" \"The Natural,\" \"The Doors,\" \"Thelma & Louise,\" \"Donnie Brasco,\" \"Free Willy,\" \"Wyatt Earp,\" \"Die Another Day,\" and \"Sin City,\" and the TV series \"24.\"\nBut it was his associations with Tarantino that stood out most. In 1992 he played Mr. Blonde, who danced while torturing a police officer and speaking into a severed ear, in \"Reservoir Dogs.\" He then appeared as an assassin in the \"Kill Bill\" films, and a killer in \"The Hateful Eight.\" He also acted opposite his \"Reservoir Dogs\" co-star Tim Roth in \"Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,\" but Tarantino cut their scenes when he trimmed the film down from four hours.\nMadsen took stock of his public image with the Hollywood Reporter in 2018: \"Fame is a two-edged sword. There are a lot of blessings but also a lot of heavy things that come with it. I think it has a lot to do with the characters I've played. I think I've been more believable than I should have been. I think people really fear me. They see me and go: 'Holy s***, there's that guy!' But I'm not that guy. I'm just an actor. I'm a father, I've got seven children. I'm married, I've been married 20 years. When I'm not making a movie, I'm home, in pajamas, watching 'The Rifleman' on TV, hopefully with my 12-year-old making me a cheeseburger. …\n\"I guess it's part of the whole bad-boy package. But I'd rather have a movie like 'Reservoir Dogs' than not have it. There are a lot of actors that are a lot more recognized or famous that me, who get paid a lot more than me who haven't done even one film that you'd remember. So I feel blessed and lucky that, that whatever I've done, I've done a couple of films that will be around for a long time and are respected.\"\nDave Parker\nThe 6-foot-5 outfielder Dave Parker (June 9, 1951-June 28, 2025), nicknamed \"the Cobra,\" was one of the best players of his era, part of two World Series championship teams: the Pittsburgh Pirates' \"We Are Family\" squad in 1979, and the Oakland A's in 1989.\nBeginning in 1973, Parker played 19 seasons in the majors, 11 for the Pirates. He was the National League MVP in 1978. He also played four seasons in his hometown with the Cincinnati Reds, and later wore the jerseys of the Milwaukee Brewers, California Angels and Toronto Blue Jays.\nParker was a seven-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove right fielder, won National League batting titles in 1977 and '78, and led the NL with 125 RBIs in 1985. He finished his career as a .290 hitter with 339 homers and 1,493 RBIs.\nHe was set to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame next month.\nParker, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2012, told reporters that he burst into tears upon learning of his selection to Cooperstown. \"Yeah, I cried,\" Parker said after receiving the news. \"It only took a few minutes, because I don't cry.\n\"I was a five-tool player. I could do them all,\" Parker said. \"I never trotted to first base. I don't know if people noticed that, but I ran hard on every play.\"\nBill Moyers\nBill Moyers (June 5, 1934-June 26, 2025) became one of television's most acclaimed journalists, after having served as a White House press secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson. His transition to the other side of the microphone, in the midst of the Vietnam War, led to a career as the publisher of a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper; bestselling author; correspondent and commentator for CBS and NBC; and host of news and current affairs programming on public television. Among his honors were more than 30 Emmy Awards, 11 Peabody Awards, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism (twice), and induction into the Television Hall of Fame.\nOrdained as a Baptist minister, he gave up the ministry and instead worked as an aide to then-Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. That led to roles in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, including deputy director of the Peace Corps. Moyers resigned as White House press secretary in December 1966, as the Vietnam War raged. He later wrote, \"We had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.\"\nIn 1967, Moyers became publisher of the Long Island newspaper Newsday. When he left after three years (and two Pulitzers), he spent the summer traveling 13,000 miles around the U.S., a trip which became the basis of his bestseller, \"Listening to America: A Traveler Rediscovers His Country.\"\nHe headlined the public television series \"Bill Moyers' Journal,\" covering topics as varied as government corruption, drug addiction, media consolidation, religion, modern dance and the environment. He was chief correspondent of \"CBS Reports\" from 1976 to 1978, and in the '80s returned to CBS as a senior news analyst for \"CBS Evening News.\" He also contributed reports to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" and was later an NBC News commentator and MSNBC host.\nMoyers referred to himself as a \"citizen journalist\" operating outside the establishment.\nAmong his PBS series and specials were \"Creativity with Bill Moyers,\" \"The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis\" (about the Iran-Contra scandal), \"Moyers: God and Politics,\" \"Beyond Hate,\" \"Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\" \"Healing and the Mind,\" \"In Search of the Constitution,\" \"Facing Evil,\" and \"Now.\"\nIn a 1997 conversation with Dallas public television station KERA correspondent Lee Cullum, Moyers spoke of a societal shift in America's sense of honor and its inverse, shame. \"While I know many honorable people, we've lost the other side of the coin — we've lost the shame that produces honor,\" he said. \"It's almost impossible to imagine anything today that is so shameful that it costs the wrongdoer in public. … Until we return to a sense of shame, that there are some things we cannot espouse as a society, and that if they are occurring then we have to be penalized for perpetuating them — we have to return to a sense of shame, I think, before we will restore a sense of honor.\"\nLalo Schifrin\nHe won four Grammy Awards, was nominated for six Oscars, and received an honorary Academy Award in 2019, with more than 200 TV and film credits to his name. But Argentinean jazz pianist Lalo Schifrin (June 21, 1932-June 26, 2025) is best known for a single piece of music, perhaps the most recognizable TV theme ever created: the title music for CBS' 1960s espionage series \"Mission: Impossible.\"\n\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the Associated Press in 2006. \"So, I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful — because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"\nSchifrin, who'd studied at the Paris Conservatory with Olivier Messiaen, was a jazz musician and classical conductor, who had worked with such legends as Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, George Benson, Zubin Mehta and Daniel Barenboim.\nHe had won a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\"; that same year he earned a nomination for the score of \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\"\nBut the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme — energetic, in 5/4 time, with a cool flute, bongo drums, and a banging bass riff — was on an altogether higher level. The show won Schifrin two Grammys, for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show.\nHe followed that series with themes composed for \"Mannix,\" \"Medical Center,\" \"Starsky & Hutch,\" \"Petrocelli,\" and \"Chicago Story.\"\nWhen \"Mission: Impossible\" was rebooted for movie screens in 1996, director Brian De Palma kept Schifrin's iconic music.\nSchifrin also wrote the score for the Paul Newman film \"Cool Hand Luke\" — propulsive music that would be used by ABC owned-and-operated stations for their local newscasts. In 2008 Schifrin told the Television Academy that when Warner Brothers — the copyright holders of \"Cool Hand Luke\" — informed him that \"Eyewitness News\" would be using his theme, his response was, \"'Fine, no problem.' I laugh all the way to the bank!\"\nHe earned Oscar nominations for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror,\" and \"The Sting II,\" as well as a best song nomination for \"People Alone,\" from \"The Competition.\" Other credits included \"Dirty Harry\" and its sequels, \"Rollercoaster,\" \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour,\" and the TV miniseries \"A.D.\" He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors — Plácido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras — sang together for the first time.\nRep. Carolyn McCarthy\nFollowing a mass shooting on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train that left her husband dead and her son, Kevin, severely wounded, Carolyn McCarthy (Jan. 5, 1944-June 26, 2025), a nurse, became a crusader for gun control.\nOn Dec. 7, 1993, a gunman opened fire on a train leaving New York City. By the time passengers tackled the shooter, six people were dead and 19 wounded.\nMcCarthy, then a Republican, jumped into politics after her GOP congressman, Daniel Frisa, voted to repeal an assault weapons ban. When she approached local Republicans about a primary challenge, they were not keen, and so, at 52, the political rookie ran on the Democratic ticket, campaigning largely on the issue of gun violence — and won.\nHer surprise victory in 1996 made McCarthy a national figure, and a familiar voice against guns in the wake of repeated tragedies, from school shootings at Columbine and Sandy Hook, to the near-fatal shooting of fellow Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Though she also worked in the areas of improving health care and education, her public face was largely shaped by her advocacy against gun violence.\nShe faced strong opposition from the National Rifle Association and other supporters of gun rights, and most of the legislation she sponsored to restrict the sales of guns or ammunition failed. One that did pass and get signed into law: a bill to improve background checks on potentially ineligible gun purchasers, such as felons and the mentally ill, signed by President George W. Bush in 2008.\nShe served in Congress until 2015. In January 2025, President Biden awarded her the Presidential Citizens Medal, America's second-highest civilian honor.\nIn 2012, following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., McCarthy offered a commentary on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" in which she stated, \"The Second Amendment is the law of the land — it's an American right to own a gun. But it's also our responsibility to protect public health and enact reasonable safety restrictions, like we do with cars or food or medicine, because too many of us are dying from gun violence every day. No parent should have to send their child to school and wonder if there will be a mass shooting there that day. … That's why I hope that we as a nation come together and take action to prevent these types of tragedies in the future.\"\nBobby Sherman\nSinger and actor Bobby Sherman (July 22, 1943-June 24, 2025) was a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s, with such Top 10 hits as \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" His squeaky-clean image made him a a regular feature on the covers of Tiger Beat and other teen magazines. In 2005, TV Guide listed him at #8 among \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"\nSherman grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing with a high-school rock band. In 1964, while he was studying child psychology at a community college, his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party where he stepped up and sang with the band. Guests, including Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, inquired if he had representation. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called and set him up with the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\"\nHe had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10.\nHe starred in the TV series \"Here Come the Brides\" (also singing the theme song, \"Seattle\"), and \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family.\"\nIn 1988, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other locations.\n\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"\nBut performing wasn't entirely out of the picture in his later life; in 1998, Sherman joined the \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.\nLou Christie\nKnown for his signature falsetto, 1960s singer Lou Christie (Feb. 19, 1943-June 18, 2025) had hits with \"Lightnin' Strikes,\" \"Two Faces Have I,\" \"Rhapsody in the Rain,\" and \"I'm Gonna Make You Mine.\"\nBorn Lugee Alfredo Giovanni Sacco in Glenwillard, Pennsylvania, Christie studied music before joining a group called the Classics, recording for small labels, before becoming a back-up singer in New York.\nHis \"Lightnin' Strikes\" went to #1 in 1965. In all, he released 12 albums, and continued hitting the high notes on oldies tours.\nIn 2021, Christie was asked by the Hazelton Standard Speaker how, at 78, he kept his falsetto voice. \"I don't do anything to maintain it,\" he said. \"I'm not a smoker. And I don't go out to loud places. My vocal range is the same as it was. I sing everything in the same key that I recorded in. I don't know how I do that. I don't think about it. I try to take care of myself. I'm not a junk eater. I don't think I've had a bottle of soda pop, or whatever you want to call it, in the past 10 years. My throat has been unbelievable to me, you know, and I just know it's something special and I just take care of it. I had a high voice when I was young and then my voice changed down to a lower register. I never lost my octaves.\"\nBrian Wilson\nAs a founding member of the '60s rock group the Beach Boys, singer-songwriter Brian Wilson (June 20, 1942-June 11, 2025) created the sun & surf sound that has been the soundtrack of summer ever since.\nIt began in 1961, on Labor Day weekend, when Wilson's parents went out of town. Using the money they'd left for food, Wilson and his brothers decided to rent some musical instruments. \"And then we starved, but we had a good, you know, time,\" Wilson told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002.\n\"We\" was Wilson; his brothers, Dennis and Carl; cousin Mike Love; and their buddy, Al Jardine.\n\"Surfing,\" the song they recorded that day under the name the Pendletons, went to #1 on the local charts. [It was helped by their own multiple calls to the radio station, changing their voices to impersonate masses of listeners.] It landed them a record contract, and their promotion manager suggested a new name — the Beach Boys — which the group didn't learn of until the record was released.\n\"Surfin' Safari\" was the first of their 29 studio albums. And never mind that Brian Wilson himself never surfed; his songs like \"Surfin',\" \"Dance, Dance, Dance,\" \"California Girls,\" \"I Get Around,\" \"Fun, Fun, Fun,\" \"Surfer Girl,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" \"Good Vibrations,\" \"Barbara Ann,\" and \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" (for which Wilson rewrote the lyrics from Chuck Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\") were instrumental in conjuring the \"California Sound\" — music evocative of carefree days at the beach — which earned them 35 Top 40 hits.\nTheir manager, the Wilsons' father, Murray, drove them hard. \"He was a huge problem,\" Love told \"Sunday Morning in 2012. \"Emotionally, he was abusive, emotionally and physically to his kids, and he was unbearable at times. Brian and I'd actually fired him.\" But Brian admitted he also pushed himself hard. \"Yeah, I drove myself. I wanted to be a perfectionist,\" he said. In 1964, Wilson suffered a nervous breakdown, quit touring, and retreated to the studio, while the rest of the group stayed on the road.\nWilson's songs were more harmonically and texturally complex than most pop music. Like the Beatles, who were the Beach Boys' most obvious artistic competitors, Wilson used rich vocal harmonics, orchestral and electronic instruments, and studio overdubbing to create dense textures on albums such as 1966's \"Pet Sounds\" (his response to the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\"). With songs connected by themes of love and loss (such as \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows\"), \"Pet Sounds\" was named by Rolling Stone magazine the second greatest album of all time. But it was a source of contention within the band itself. \"Mike and the guys didn't like it,\" Wilson told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"\nBut by the late 1960s, Wilson was struggling to write — his follow-up album to \"Pet Sounds,\" called \"Smile,\" was shelved — and he plunged into a severe depression. The band splintered. He was plagued by substance abuse and obesity. Along the way, Wilson's marriage fell apart, and he was estranged from his daughters, Carnie and Wendy (who, with another daughter of rock legends, Chynna Phillips, formed the trio Wilson Phillips).\nIn desperation, Wilson went under the round-the-clock care of an unorthodox psychologist, Eugene Landy, whose years-long grip on the songwriter was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Wilson's will had been revised, with Landy named as his main beneficiary. They won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient.\nEventually, Wilson got well enough to record again. He released 13 solo albums beginning in 1988, and performed with Carnie and Wendy. He also had to come to terms with the deaths of his brothers, Dennis (in a 1983 drowning) and Carl (in 1998, from cancer). He married Melinda Ledbetter in 1995, and they had five adopted children together.\nAnd in 2012, to mark the band's 50th anniversary, Brian Wilson reunited with Beach Boys members Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks and Bruce Johnston for a Grammys appearance. And when they returned to the studio together for the first time in nearly two decades to make a new album, \"That's Why God Made the Radio,\" the bitterness had fallen away — and the good vibrations were back.\nSly Stone\nWith his band Sly and the Family Stone, musician Sly Stone (March 15, 1943-June 9, 2025) invented his own hybrid of rock 'n' roll, R&B and funk, becoming one of the most influential musicians of the late 1960s and early '70s, with such songs as \"Dance to the Music,\" \"Everyday People,\" and \"Hot Fun in the Summertime.\"\nBorn Sylvester Stewart, he grew up in California, singing gospel with his siblings. He performed with school bands and worked as a radio DJ and record producer before founding Sly and the Family Stone in 1966. Stone said he picked the racially-mixed blend of men and women to inspire audiences. (Among the players: trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Greg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham Jr. His own siblings — Freddie, frontman of Freddie & The Stone Souls; Vet; and Rose — would also join.)\nAs he told the Guardian in 2013, \"I wanted people to look onstage and see the world and how the world can get along. If they could see us, see we were having fun, it might make it easier for them to catch on.\"\nThey released three albums (\"A Whole New Thing,\" \"Dance to the Music,\" and \"Life\") that were blends of psychedelic rock and soul, before their fourth, 1969's \"Stand!,\" with the songs \"I Want to Take You Higher,\" \"Sing a Simple Song,\" and the #1 hit \"Everyday People,\" put them on the map. That summer they played the Harlem Cultural Festival (footage of which was preserved in the documentary \"Summer of Soul\"), and at Woodstock. Stone's joyous performances and musical innovations made the band stand out.\nBut his music gradually grew darker. Their follow-up album, 1971's \"There's a Riot Goin' On\" (which included the tracks \"Family Affair,\" \"Runnin' Away,\" and \"Thank You for Talkin' to Me Africa\"), hit #1 with its trenchant social commentary and drum machine beats. But the making of the album was turbulent: Stone struggled due to drugs, and the band was falling apart. He often missed gigs (although he managed to make it to his own wedding, to Kathy Silva, at Madison Square Garden in 1974).\nBy the 1980s, Sly and the Family Stone had dissolved, and Stone was rarely seen by the public. He made a few comeback attempts, but was mostly out of view. In 2006, he appeared at a Grammys tribute with his original group and left before it was over. In 2011, the New York Post wrote that Stone was homeless, living in a van in Los Angeles.\nBut he eventually cleaned up his act. According to his longtime manager Arlene Hirschkowitz, by 2019, Stone was sober, and in 2023 he published a memoir (co-written by Ben Greenman), with a title taken from his classic 1969 song, \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again).\"\nLoretta Swit\nEmmy Award-winning actress Loretta Swit (Nov. 4, 1937-May 30, 2025) was best known for bringing Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.\nAfter small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.\nAs the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married – and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine – everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"\nShe won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.\nA native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"\nOn stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.\nHoulihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\"\nSebastião Salgado\nThe style of Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebastião Salgado (Feb. 8, 1944-May 23, 2025) was marked by rich black-and-white imagery of imperiled nature and impoverished humanity. Though he insisted he was \"just a photographer,\" Salgado's genius was in focusing on real people and the dignity of their toil: miners in Brazil, India and Indonesia; fishermen in the Mediterranean; cane cutters in Cuba; firefighters engaging with oil well conflagrations in Kuwait; slaughterhouse workers in South Dakota.\nBorn in Aimorés, Brazil, Salgado emigrated to France in 1969 while Brazil was under a military dictatorship. In Paris, he dedicated himself to photography. His pictures were distributed by Sygma, Gamma and Magnum, of which he later became president. In 1994 Salgado and his wife founded the Amazonia Images agency to distribute his work.\nSalgado's main projects included the \"Amazonia\" series; \"Gold,\" about the extraction of gold from the earth; \"Genesis,\" a tour of the world at its most primordial; and \"Exodus,\" which depicted refugees and migrants.\nIn 1995, Salgado, overseeing his exhibition titled \"Workers\" at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, described to \"Sunday Morning\" his images that captured men and woman whose labor was being increasingly replaced by mechanized industrialization: \"I believe it's a story of humanity, the way that we work, that we produce, from the beginnings until now … I believe that all humanity must know about it because if you want to build something for the future, we must know the past, and we must know what's happening at the present moment.\"\nIn addition to photography, Salgado was also an environmental activist, working to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, and founding a nature reserve. He and his wife also created Instituto Terra, which to date has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimorés.\nSalgado was the subject of the 2014 Oscar-nominated documentary \"The Salt of the Earth,\" co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado.\nGeorge Wendt\nActor George Wendt (October 17, 1948-May 20, 2025) earned six Emmy Award nominations for playing his most recognizable character: the affable barfly Norm Peterson – just one of the denizens of the Boston bar known as \"Cheers.\"\nAfter spending six years at the Second City improv troupe in Chicago, Wendt was not optimistic about auditioning for \"Cheers,\" as he recounted in a 2012 oral history for GQ: \"My agent said, 'It's a small role, honey. It's one line. Actually, it's one word.' The word was 'beer.' I was having a hard time believing I was right for the role of 'the guy who looked like he wanted a beer.' So I went in, and they said, 'It's too small a role. Why don't you read this other one?' And it was a guy who never left the bar.\"\nCoach: \"How's life treating you Norm?\"\nNorm: \"Like it caught me in bed with its wife.\"\nAfter \"Cheers,\" Wendt starred in his own sitcom, \"The George Wendt Show,\" and appeared on \"Seinfeld,\" \"Frasier,\" \"The Naked Truth,\" \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" \"The Ghost Whisperer,\" \"Harry's Law\" and \"Portlandia.\"\nWendt later appeared on Broadway in \"Art,\" \"Hairspray,\" \"Elf,\" and \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (playing a bartender). He starred in a national tour of \"12 Angry Men,\" and in productions of David Mamet's \"Lakeboat,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" \"The Odd Couple,\" \"Never Too Late\" and \"Funnyman.\"\nJill Sobule\nDuring her more than three decades of recording, singer-songwriter-guitarist Jill Sobule (Jan. 16, 1959-May 1, 2025) released more than a dozen albums, EPs and compilations that addressed such complex subject matter as the death penalty, anorexia, the French Resistance, teen mental health, religion, and LGBTQ+ issues. Her 1995 song \"I Kissed A Girl\" was the first openly-gay-themed song to make it into the Billboard Top 20 despite being banned by many Southern radio stations.\nOther hits included \"Too Cool to Fall in Love,\" \"Supermodel\" (from the movie \"Clueless\"), and \"Bitter.\"\nBorn in Denver, Sobule was praised for her witty and poignant writing, which first attracted attention with her 1990 album, \"Things Here Are Different.\" After two record companies dropped her and two indie labels she was tied to went bankrupt, Sobule turned to crowdfunding, with a website, jillsnextrecord.com, to raise $75,000. \"I think I got it within six weeks,\" Sobule told \"CBS Evening News.\" In addition to small dollar gifts, one donor wrote in saying, \"'I'm really not a fan of your music, but I think this is a great new model, so I'm giving you $50.'\" The resulting album, \"California Years,\" was released in 2009. She turned to crowdsourcing again for the 2018 album \"Nostalgia Kills.\"\nSobule performed with such artists as Neil Young, Melissa Etheridge, Billy Bragg, Warren Zevon and Cyndi Lauper; appeared with \"SNL\" comedian Julia Sweeney in a stage show, \"Jill and Julia\"; and played herself performing a song on \"The Simpsons.\" She also starred in \"F*CK7thGrade,\" a 2022 autobiographical off-Broadway show described as \"a queer musical memoir\" that was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.\nIn April, in an interview with Cincy Music, Sobule was asked about the changes she has seen in the recording business during her career. \"The demise of the music industry as we once knew it, hasn't been great,\" she said. \"Thinking of the sad-ass checks from Spotify. But it has also made one become creative in other endeavors. For example, musical theater. I do tell my theater pals that I have moved on from the music industry, as I've been told off-Broadway theater is so lucrative. They just laugh.\"\nRuth Buzzi\nComedian Ruth Buzzi (July 24, 1936-May 1, 2025) rose to fame on NBC's \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" playing frumpy Gladys Ormphby, a hair-net-wearing spinster wielding her purse against the advances of a dirty old man (or, indeed, anyone).\nBuzzi, who appeared on \"The Garry Moore Show\" and had guest spots on \"The Monkees\" and \"That Girl,\" had played several characters on \"The Steve Allen Comedy Hour,\" when she was noticed by \"Laugh-In\" creator-producer George Schlatter. In his memoir, \"Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy,\" Schlatter wrote, \"I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.\"\nShe threw herself into several characters on the sketch comedy show, from drunken barflies to Hollywood gossip columnist Busy Buzzi and Alice Capone (a takeoff on Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone). But Gladys Ormphby was the one with the most mileage. She brought her Ormphby character (and her purse) to the \"Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts,\" \"Sesame Street,\" a Weird Al Yankovic music video, and a Canada Dry ginger ale ad.\n\"Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\" Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \"So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who's been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that's almost everyone at some time or other.\"\nBuzzi won a Golden Globe, and earned two Emmy nominations, for \"Laugh-In.\"\nShe was also in the original Broadway cast of \"Sweet Charity\" with Gwen Verdon in 1966, and had numerous TV and movie credits over the years, with appearances in \"Love, American Style,\" \"Medical Center,\" \"You Can't Do That on Television,\" \"Alice,\" \"Freaky Friday,\" \"The Jamie Foxx Show,\" \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" and more.\nThe hairnet and costume of Gladys was, Buzzi said, headed to the Smithsonian, but the character was never far away. \"So many people ask me to hit them with my purse,\" she told the Jamestown, N.Y. Post-Journal in 2017. \"In fact, a few years ago we were at a Beverly Hills party and in walked Elton John. He immediately made his way over to me and said, 'For God's sakes, Ruth, please hit me with your purse. That's been on my bucket list for years!'\"\nPope Francis\nIn 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled an end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"\nAnd the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\nHe spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.\nHis charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"\nThe 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.\nHis writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.\nHis first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! … Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"\nAnd despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.\n\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"\nIn 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"\nHe then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\"\nJean Marsh\nActress Jean Marsh (July 1, 1934-April 13, 2025) won an Emmy for her performance as Rose Buck, a Cockney parlor maid, in the British TV series \"Upstairs, Downstairs,\" a show she co-created.\nIt was during a vacation in the south of France when she and actress Eileen Atkins (both of whom had been raised in working-class environments) came up with the storyline of \"Upstairs, Downstairs.\" Set in Edwardian London, it traced the lives of the well-to-do Bellamy family and the servants in their Belgravia townhouse. The show ran from 1971-75 and was an international hit, earning Marsh three Emmy nominations and a win.\nA BBC sequel, begun in 2010 and starring Claire Foy, featured Marsh (the only actor to appear in both series) as Rose, this time promoted to housekeeper. She earned a fourth Emmy nomination, but her participation was limited in the second season, having suffered a minor stroke. Marsh and Atkins also created a 1990s BBC series, \"The House of Eliott.\"\nAsked once about royalties she may have earned from creating and starring in \"Upstairs, Downstairs,\" Marsh noted the differences between Hollywood and British TV: \"If it had happened in America, I'd be Mary Tyler Moore. As it is, I'm Mary Tyler Less,\" she told UPI in 1982.\nBorn in London, Marsh attended dancing school and the Aida Foster Theatre School. She made her West End debut at age 12, and appeared in repertory productions before traveling to Broadway in 1959, to star as Hero in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" opposite John Gielgud. She also starred with Laurence Olivier in a TV production of \"The Moon and Sixpence.\"\nMarsh's other TV roles included a 1959 \"Twilight Zone\" episode, \"The Lonely,\" in which she played an android, gifted to a condemned man confined to a solitary life on an asteroid. She starred as Sara Kingdom, an assistant of \"Doctor Who\" during the BBC series' third season. She appeared in \"Danger Man,\" \"I Spy,\" \"The Saint,\" \"Jane Eyre\" (as Rochester's wife), \"UFO,\" \"The Waltons,\" \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"Nine to Five,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Fatherland,\" and \"Sense & Sensibility.\"\nIn films she appeared in \"Cleopatra\" as the wife of Marc Antony; \"Charlie Bubbles,\" with Albert Finney; Alfred Hitchcock's \"Frenzy\"; \"The Eagle Has Landed\"; \"The Changeling\"; \"Return to Oz\"; \"Willow\"; and \"Danny the Champion of the World.\"\nShe returned to Broadway in the '70s in Alan Bennett's \"Habeas Corpus,\" and \"Whose Life Is It Anyway?\" opposite Tom Conti.\nShe also wrote fiction, including novels based on \"The House of Eliott.\" Marsh described her writing process to This Is Bristol in 2011: \"When I write, I am never really sure where the story is going. The only way I can describe the process is that my characters sometimes do things without my permission. When I was writing 'Fiennders Abbey,' one of them died without my permission, and I remember being quite upset. I had to take a break and have a glass of wine.\"\nJay North\n\"Hey, Mr. Wilson!\" Jay North (Aug. 3, 1951-April 6, 2025), who began appearing on kids' TV shows when he was 5, had already played small roles on \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" when he was cast, at age 6, as the bright-eyed troublemaker in the TV adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip \"Dennis the Menace.\" The series ran on CBS for four years beginning in 1959, but Dennis continued to strike terror in the heart of his elderly neighbor, George Wilson, for years after in syndication.\nThe stardom came at a cost to the child. He told the Los Angeles Daily News in 1993 that he had been abused by his aunt and uncle, who would be with him on set while North's single mom was at work. \"If it took me more than one or two takes, I would be threatened and then whacked,\" North said.\nHis other TV and film credits in the 1960s and early '70s included \"Wagon Train,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"Maya,\" and voice work for \"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" and \"The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show.\"\nAfter appearing on stage in \"Butterflies Are Free,\" North had a brief stint in the Navy in the 1970s, and tried to return to show business with more mature, darker roles. Aside from a 1985 Yugoslavian World War II film, \"Wild Wind,\" North's appearances were mostly playing off his child actor past. He satirized his Dennis the Menace role on HBO's \"Not Necessarily the News,\" and played himself in a 1999 episode of \"The Simpsons\" and the David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\"\nHe also helped counsel other child and former child actors through the nonprofit organization A Minor Consideration.\nVal Kilmer\nThe smoldering intensity of actor Val Kilmer (Dec. 31, 1959-April 1, 2025) radiated off movie screens with his memorable turns as brooding artists, obsessive criminals, doomed lawmen, and a fighter jock nicknamed Iceman. He starred in such films as \"Top Gun,\" \"Heat,\" \"Tombstone\" and \"The Doors.\"\nWhile attending New York City's Juilliard School (he was admitted at age 17), Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began.\" In 1983 he starred on Broadway in the play \"Slab Boys,\" opposite Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. He made his movie debut in the 1984 spoof \"Top Secret!\" (from the creators of \"Airplane!\"), followed by \"Real Genius.\"\nOne of his most memorable characters, that of pilot Tom Kazansky in 1986's \"Top Gun,\" almost didn't happen. Kilmer wrote in his 2020 memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry,\" that he initially turned down the role: \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me.\" Script changes led to his signing up.\nAs a charismatic leading man, Kilmer commanded the screen playing Doc Holliday in the western \"Tombstone,\" a demolition expert in the bank heist film \"Heat,\" and rock idol Jim Morrison in \"The Doors.\" Other films included \"Willow,\" \"Thunderheart,\" \"True Romance,\" \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"The Saint,\" \"Alexander,\" \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\" \"Déjà Vu,\" \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans,\" \"Joe the King,\" \"Spartan,\" \"Twixt,\" and \"Wonderland.\"\nKilmer wrote, directed and starred in a one-man stage show in which he played humorist Mark Twain, titled \"Citizen Twain.\" He also published two books of poetry. Following treatments for cancer, Kilmer repeated the role of Iceman in the 2022 sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\nA low point may have been when he donned the Batman costume to star in the 1995 film \"Batman Forever.\" He explained in the documentary \"Val\" that the suit constricted his performance: \"It was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"\nKilmer's reputation for being difficult on set would dog him (John Frankenheimer, who replaced the fired director of \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" told Entertainment Weekly that there were two things he would never do: \"Climb Mount Everest, and work with Val Kilmer again\"). But he was also praised by fellow actors for his immersion into his characters.\nIn a tribute to Kilmer, actress Jennifer Tilly recalled the audition process for Oliver Stone's \"The Doors\": \"It was kind of a cattle call. They paired together potential Jims with potential Pamelas. And they were running behind so we were spilling out of the casting office, sitting on the porch, the lawn, and the driveway. All of a sudden, a sixties convertible came screeching up, blaring Doors Music at top volume. And a guy jumped out and strode inside: He had wild hair and he was barefoot, shirtless, and wearing nothing but a pair of tight leather pants. We all looked at each other like… Who is this guy? We were more than a little shook by the sheer audacity of his entrance. Well of course it was Val Kilmer and from that minute on, nobody else stood a chance.\"\nRichard Chamberlain\nActor Richard Chamberlain (March 31, 1934-March 29, 2025) became a star and teen heartthrob playing the title character of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare,\" and later became known as \"king of the miniseries\" for his starring roles in such hits as \"Shogun\" and \"The Thorn Birds,\" for which he won two Golden Globes.\nBorn in Beverly Hills, Chamberlain originally studied to be a painter. But after serving in the Army during the Korean War, he decided to pursue acting. Small roles in \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mr. Lucky,\" and the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" lead to his role as Dr. James Kildare.\nThe show, which ran for five seasons, featured Chamberlain as the handsome and caring attendant to a panoply of guest-star patients seeking aid and comfort for a variety of afflictions. While the show inspired numerous medical series to follow, its star received 12,000 pieces of fan mail a week, in addition to requests for medical advice. \"I didn't entirely buy the fact that I was thought enchanting by a lot of people,\" he told The Associated Press in 2014. \"But I enjoyed it tremendously, even as a part of me went, 'Realllly?!'\"\nHis roles in \"Dr. Kildare\" and the romantic drama \"Joy in the Morning\" led to his being named Photoplay magazine's most popular male star in 1963-65.\nAfter the series was cancelled, Chamberlain moved to England, where he starred in \"Petulia\" opposite Julie Christie, and the BBC adaptation of Henry James' \"The Portrait of a Lady.\" He also played \"Hamlet\" on stage, a performance he repeated in a 1970 TV adaptation. Other films and TV movies included \"Julius Caesar\" with Charlton Heston, \"The Madwoman of Chaillot\" with Katharine Hepburn, Ken Russell's \"The Music Lovers,\" \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels, \"The Count of Monte-Cristo,\" \"The Man in the Iron Mask,\" and \"The Last Wave.\"\nIn 1978 he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" a 26-hour miniseries based on James Michener's novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun\" (another epic miniseries based on James Clavell's novel about an American visitor to feudal Japan), and 1983's \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's romantic bestseller. Chamberlain played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest who falls in love with Rachel Ward's Meggie Cleary. The ABC production, also starring Barbara Stanwyck, attracted a reported 100 million viewers. He reprised his role of de Bricassart in a 1996 TV movie, \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"\nOther film and TV credits included \"King Solomon's Mines,\" \"Wallenberg: A Hero's Story,\" \"The Bourne Identity,\" \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"The Drew Carey Show,\" \"Will & Grace,\" and the 2017 revival of \"Twin Peaks.\"\nHaving starred in the film musical \"The Slipper and the Rose,\" Chamberlain appeared on stage as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady,\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"\nIt was decades into his career, in 2003, that Chamberlain revealed, in his autobiography \"Shattered Love,\" that he was gay.\nIn his memoir, Chamberlain wrote of how he was forced to hide his sexuality by escorting actresses to movie premieres and other public events. No longer playing \"a cat-and-mouse game\" with the press, he could now be open. \"I was one tough interview,\" he told The New York Times in 2003. But now, ''I have no image to defend.\"\nHaving experienced a troubled childhood, an alcoholic father, and a lingering \"sense that there was something wrong with me,\" Chamberlain told The AP in 2014 that he was at a happy stage in his life because he had accepted himself. \"I think love is the source of wisdom, of strength, of intelligence,\" he said. \"It's a presence that exists within us and without us. I think it's all of that. It's not a box of chocolates.\"\nGeorge Foreman\nBoxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.\nIn 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.\nAt the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"\nThree years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"\nBut money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first — too old, too fat, too slow, they said — but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.\nThat same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.\n\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.\nAnd he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.\n\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"\nMarried five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember — it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"\nIt also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\"\nAlan Simpson\nA political moderate, Republican Senator Alan Simpson (Sept. 2, 1931-March 14, 2025) served three terms representing Wyoming, from 1979 to 1997, and played a key role in rallying GOP support around the party's legislative agenda.\nAt 6-foot-7 (he was the tallest Senator up to that time) with a quick wit, Simpson was able to bridge partisan impasses, and foster relationships across the aisle at a time of increasing political acrimony. \"The word 'politics' is interesting,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, \"because it comes from the Greek, you know that? Poly, meaning many, and tics, meaning blood-sucking insects!\"\nSimpson maintained his own views even when they crossed Republican orthodoxy. A deficit hawk, Simpson also supported abortion rights. He served on the Immigration Subcommittee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, among others.\nAfter leaving the Senate, Simpson taught about politics and the media at Harvard University and the University of Wyoming. In speeches he urged college students to become politically involved.\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden awarded Simpson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nOne of Simpson's closest friends was a Democrat, Norman Mineta, a Congressman from California who also served as Commerce Secretary under President Bill Clinton and as Transportation Secretary under President George W. Bush.\nThe two had met as Boy Scouts when Mineta and his family were imprisoned as Japanese-Americans in the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center near Simpson's hometown of Cody, Wyo., during World War II. Simpson and Menieta bonded over playing pranks on the other Scouts, including a bully whose tent they sabotaged: \"It was raining to beat hell and we kinda channeled the water down into this guy's tent,\" Simpson told \"Sunday Morning.\"\nThe two friends would not see each other until decades later, when Mineta (who had become Mayor of San Jose, Calif.), won election to Congress. \"And there we were, and we started right over just like that,\" Simpson said.\nMineta said, \"We'd have fights in the sub-committee, the full committee, and yet we'd slap each other on the back and say, 'Come on, let's go have dinner, let's go have a drink.' And they don't do that [today]. They just don't have that kind of personal relationship.\"\nIn 1988 Simpson and Mineta joined forces to help pass the Civil Liberties Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, which for the very first time formally apologized to Japanese-Americans, and granted reparations to those who had been imprisoned.\nJoseph Wambaugh\nBestselling author Joseph Wambaugh (Jan. 22, 1937-Feb. 28, 2025), a former Los Angeles police officer, wrote 11 novels about crime and policing as well as non-fiction works, several of which were adapted for films and television, including \"The New Centurions,\" \"The Blue Knight,\" and \"The Choirboys,\" as well as the true-crime stories \"The Onion Field\" and \"Echoes in the Darkness.\" He was also the co-creator of the anthology series \"Police Story,\" which debuted on NBC in 1973.\nOther novels included \"The Black Marble,\" \"The Glitter Dome,\" \"The Delta Star\" and \"The Secrets of Harry Bright.\" He was the winner of three Edgar Awards.\nThe son of a police officer, Wambaugh (a Marine veteran who originally intended to become an English teacher) drew on his own experiences as an L.A. police officer for his writing, as well as stories heard from other veterans of the force. He was a detective sergeant when his first novel, \"The New Centurions,\" was published in 1971.\nBy the time \"The Onion Field\" was published, his celebrity had become so great it interfered with his police work. He quit the LAPD after 14 years on the job and began writing full-time.\nIn a 1997 symposium at the University of California, Wambaugh said, \"Police procedurals generally tell how a cop acts on the job, and I was more interested in how the job acts on the cop, and the cop's head. So, from the very beginning that was my interest. That's what I wrote about, and that's what made my stuff different, because some of my stories, police stories, have virtually no action whatsoever. No gunplay. Nothing much happening, except what's happening inside the head of the man or woman doing the job.\"\nDavid Johansen\nMusician and vocalist David Johansen (Jan. 9, 1950-Feb. 28, 2025) was known both for his role in the glam-protopunk band the New York Dolls, and for his stage persona as an over-the-top pompadour-styled lounge singer who performed swing and blues-infused pop under the name Buster Poindexter.\nWhile the New York Dolls didn't achieve mainstream success (internal strife and addictions tore at the founding members, who produced two albums before breaking up), it influenced other groups in the '70s, including the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Kiss and Guns N' Roses. In 2004 Johansen reconstituted the Dolls with new players (four of its members had died by then) for England's Meltdown Festival, which led to three more albums.\nIn the 1980s, Johansen, as Buster Poindexter, had a hit with \"Hot, Hot, Hot,\" and a cover of \"Hit the Road, Jack.\" By 2000, he was back to recording under his own name, with the albums \"David Johansen and the Harry Smiths\" and \"Shaker.\"\nHe also acted in the films \"Candy Mountain,\" \"Let It Ride,\" \"Freejack,\" \"Married to the Mob,\" the Bill Murray comedy \"Scrooged\" (as the Ghost of Christmas Past), and the TV series \"Oz,\" and hosted a weekly show on Sirius Satellite Radio.\nIn a 2014 profile for Interview Magazine, Johansen said he began the Buster Poindexter character while performing a series of cabaret shows at Tramps, a Lower East Side bar. \"I used that moniker because I didn't want people to be coming in and yelling for songs that I was famous for; I could just do what I wanted,\" he said. Then, \"without any publicity or anything, it became very popular, so I started doing weekends there. It wasn't a plan or anything, it just happened.\"\nHe was insouciant about reactions to the lounge music he performed as Buster: \"Well, like a lot of stuff I do, 10 years later it becomes popular,\" he told Interview.\nBoris Spassky\nIn 1972, Soviet-era world chess grandmaster Boris Spassky (Jan. 30, 1937-Feb. 27, 2025) lost his world championship title to American Bobby Fischer in a televised tournament in Reykjavik, Iceland, that became an international sensation during the Cold War.\nThen 29 years old, Fischer, a chess genius from Brooklyn, lost and forfeited the first two games, then beat Spassky in the third. Fischer would overcome Spassky in the 21-game tournament, becoming the first American to attain the world chess title, after the Soviet Union had dominated the game for decades. [Fischer would later forfeit the title by refusing to defend it.]\nIn a 2016 interview with Sport-Express newspaper, Spassky said that when he played his third match against Fischer, he was pressured by the chairman of the Sports Committee to stop the tournament early: \"He instructed me what to do: 'File a protest against this, against that, then just fly away ...' But I resisted – I wanted to play! What a fool I was.\"\nIn 1974, in New York City, Spassky simultaneously played 41 competitors, ranging from chess experts to novices (including a six-year-old). Beginning each game with the move Pawn-to-King 4, Spassky won 40 matches and drew one.\nHe emigrated to France in 1976, but in 2012 he returned to Moscow.\nIn his 2016 interview, Spassky said his years in the late 1960s and early '70s as world champion were his unhappiest, because of the responsibility he held from winning: \"You can't imagine how relieved I was when Fischer took the title off me,\" he said. \"Honestly, I don't recall that day as unhappy. On the contrary, I've thrown off a very strong burden and breathed freely.\"\nGene Hackman\nTwo-time Oscar-winner Gene Hackman (Sept. 1, 2023-death announced Feb. 27, 2025) was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as \"The French Connection,\" \"The Conversation\" and \"Unforgiven,\" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three \"Superman\" films.\nHailed as one of the best actors of the era, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (\"I Never Sang for My Father\"), crime dramas (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mississippi Burning\"), thrillers (\"The Conversation,\" \"No Way Out\"), and triumphant tales of sports (\"Hoosiers\"), to comedies (\"Get Shorty,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums\"). Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a sinister, unforeseeable edge, the way an animal's behavior is not entirely predictable.\n\"The French Connection\" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers — like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale. He won his first Academy Award, and his star power led him to both big-budget studio fare (headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure\"), and small character dramas (such as \"Scarecrow,\" opposite Al Pacino).\nIn 1992, the year he appeared in Clint Eastwood's revised western \"Unforgiven\" (as the brutal sheriff \"Little\" Bill Daggett), he also starred on Broadway in \"Death and the Maiden\" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols.\nHackman was less \"method-y\" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character — fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years – took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: \"Vesuvius.\"\nWhen he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with, and decided to try writing one — a pirate story. Picking different starting points, Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a café to go over their work. \"I would have some pages, he would have some pages,\" Hackman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2000. \"We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work, and decided where we were going to go from there.\"\n\"The Wake of the Perdido Star,\" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well, but received mixed reviews. He told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me — and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\"\nHe retired from the screen in 2004, and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He turned down most interview requests, but in 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of \"The French Connection,\" he shared with the New York Post the revelation that he'd only watched the film once. \"Filmmaking has always been risky — both physically and emotionally — but I do choose to consider that film a moment in a checkered career of hits and misses,\" he wrote in an email.\nMichelle Trachtenberg\nAs a child actress, Michelle Trachtenberg (Oct. 11, 1985-Feb. 26, 2025) starred in 1996's \"Harriet the Spy,\" playing Louise Fitzhugh's diminutive detective. She went on to star in two popular TV series, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Gossip Girl.\"\nTrachtenberg was 8 years old when she began playing Nona Mecklenberg on \"The Adventures of Pete & Pete,\" which ran from 1994 to 1996 on Nickelodeon. She also appeared with Matthew Broderick in the film \"Inspector Gadget.\"\nIn 2000 Trachtenberg joined the cast of \"Buffy,\" playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of Sarah Michelle Gellar's vampire slayer. (She and Gellar had both worked together on \"All My Children\" in the mid-'90s.) Trachtenberg received a Daytime Emmy nomination in 2001 for hosting Discovery's \"Truth or Scare.\"\nOn \"Gossip Girl,\" Trachtenberg played the scheming Georgina Sparks. \"It's definitely a lot more fun than playing the good girl,\" she told Seventeen magazine in 2009. \"I never understood why some actors don't want to play villains or evil characters.\"\nHer other TV credits included \"Six Feet Under,\" \"The Circuit,\" \"Mercy,\" \"Love Bites,\" \"Weeds,\" \"NCIS: Los Angeles,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" and \"Sleepy Hollow.\" Movie roles included \"Euro Trip,\" \"Ice Princess,\" \"Beautiful Ohio,\" \"17 Again,\" \"Black Christmas,\" \"Mysterious Skin,\" \"Sister Cities,\" and \"Killing Kennedy,\" in which she played Marina Oswald, wife of the president's assassin.\nRoberta Flack\nGrammy-winning singer and pianist Roberta Flack (Feb. 10, 1937-Feb. 24, 2025) was one of the top recording artists of the 1970s, with such hits as \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and \"The Closer I Get To You.\"\nClassically trained, Flack earned a full scholarship at age 15 to Howard University, then taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools and performed in jazz clubs. She was discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" With her soft soprano voice, Flack's performances were measured and reflective, turning up-tempo songs into warm, soulful ballads.\nSigned to Atlantic Records, her debut album, \"First Take\" — a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz – was released in 1969. One track was a love song by English folk artist Ewan MacColl — music Flack had taught during her years as an educator.\n\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" would make her a star, when her cover of the song, used in the Clint Eastwood film \"Play Misty for Me,\" was released in 1972 as a single and spent six weeks at No. 1. It won her a Grammy for record of the year. The following year she became the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song.\"\nFlack had a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love,\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-'90s, the Fugees won a Grammy for their cover of \"Killing Me Softly.\"\nIn 2015, Flack talked with the Guardian about the cover of \"Killing Me Softly\": \" I love hip-hop. In fact I love music, period. Lauryn Hill recorded 'Killing Me Softly' [with the Fugees] and did an excellent job. She's a genius musician and so is Wyclef Jean who co-produced it. I'm not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it; I'm a music lover who has enough experience and common sense to know that it's good they recorded it and had a hit.\"\nOverall, Flack won five Grammys and eight more nominations, and received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020. She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York.\nClint Hill\nOn Nov. 22, 1963, Secret Service Agent Clint Hill (Jan. 4, 1932-Feb. 21, 2025) was accompanying the presidential motorcade when shots were fired in Dealey Plaza, striking President John F. Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connolly. Images from that day show Hill jumping atop the presidential limousine to protect first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who had begun climbing out of the open-top vehicle.\nHill, assigned to the first lady, was riding on the left running board of the follow-up car when he jumped off, and pulled himself onto the trunk of the limousine as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy back into her seat as the limousine sped off to Parkland Memorial Hospital.\nHaunted by memories of the assassination, Hill, who'd joined the Secret Service in 1958, retired early, and in a 1975 interview with \"60 Minutes,\" told Mike Wallace he blamed himself for JFK's death, saying that if only he'd reacted \"five-tenths of a second faster,\" the president would be alive. \"And I'll live with that to my grave.\"\nTwenty years later, in a follow-up interview for \"60 Minutes,\" and in a book, \"Five Days in November,\" Hill shared his sense of failure in protecting the president that led him, in 1990, to return to Dallas. \"I walked the area of Dealey Plaza, I went up into the School Book Depository, I went up to the sixth floor, and I did everything I could to examine exactly the situation: the angles, the weather, all the conditions that existed that day. I came away with the conclusion that on that particular day, all the advantages had gone to the shooter — we didn't have any — and that I had done everything I could to try to prevent the assassination from happening. But I still feel today a sense of failure and responsibility because that was our job: to keep the president safe, to protect him at all costs. And on that particular day, we were unable to do that.\"\nThe sense of failure fueled a depression that he said damaged his relationships with his family and friends and contributed to the demise of his marriage. \"I drank heavily and I smoked a lot,\" he said. \"It was the only thing that would relieve the pain and the anguish that I had, thinking about what had happened in Dallas in 1963. A friend of mine was a doctor, came to me and said, 'Look, Clint, if you don't change what you're doing, you're going to die. You have a choice to make: live or die.' And I chose to live. And so, it was those words from that doctor that made me realize life was too precious to give up on.\"\nHill co-authored several books, wrote a 2005 memoir, \"Between You and Me,\" and became a public speaker about his experiences. He also remarried.\nIn his follow-up conversation with \"60 Minutes,\" Hill read a letter that had been written to him by a viewer following his 1975 interview: \"It is a day I shall never forget, nor shall I forget the people so deeply involved in the events of that day. And as I watched you on '60 Minutes,' I wanted to reach out and wrap you in my arms to offer some comfort. But no one who suffered that tremendous loss that day can even feel comfort, and I know you feel that.\"\nTom Robbins\nAuthor Tom Robbins (July 22, 1932-Feb. 9, 2025) was a literary prankster whose screwball novels included \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,\" \"Another Roadside Attraction,\" \"Still Life with Woodpecker,\" \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" and \"Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas.\"\nA dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate), Robbins joined the Air Force for a tad, and moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early 1960s. He was writing for the Seattle Times when a Doubleday editor advanced him $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction\" (published in 1971). It became a hit in paperback, and was followed by \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,\" featuring Sissy Hankshaw, a young lady with ridiculously enormous thumbs who becomes a proficient hitchhiker. It sold more than 1 million copies.\nLabeled \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters\" by People magazine, Robbins produced farcical works that captured the wide-open spirit of the 1960s. He understood the era, having lived it so fully — dropping acid, hitchhiking coast to coast, and traveling from Tanzania to the Himalayas. He published eight novels, a novella, and a 2014 memoir (\"Tibetan Peach Pie: A True Account of an Imaginative Life\"). His last novel was 2003's \"Villa Incognito.\"\n\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in \"Tibetan Peach Pie.\" \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"\nIn the 1990s, when the FBI sought clues to the identity of the Unabomber, they happened upon Robbins' 1980 novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker,\" whose plot features an outlaw bomber. Robbins alleged that the agency sent two agents, both attractive women, to interview him. \"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"\nTony Roberts\nBeyond his frequent appearances on the New York stage, Tony Award-nominated actor Tony Roberts (Oct. 22, 1939-Feb. 7, 2025) was familiar from acting in several Woody Allen films, including \"Annie Hall.\"\nHe made his first Broadway appearance in \"Something About a Soldier,\" in 1962. When his then-girlfriend got the position of understudy to Elizabeth Ashley in \"Barefoot in the Park,\" she convinced producers to hire Roberts as the understudy to Robert Redford's understudy. Then came a fateful Broadway Show League softball game: \"The guy I was understudying got up at the plate and hit a single, but he tried to stretch it into a double, slid into second base, and then was holding onto his ankle in great pain. His broken ankle was my big break,\" he told Broadway World in 2015. \"I played Redford's role for two weeks and when he left the cast sometime later, I replaced him.\"\nRoberts earned a Tony nomination for the musical \"How Now, Dow Jones,\" and a second for the Woody Allen-scripted \"Play It Again, Sam.\" Other stage credits included \"Take Her, She's Mine,\" \"Never Too Late,\" \"The Last Analysis,\" \"Don't Drink the Water,\" \"How Now, Dow Jones,\" \"Promises, Promises,\" \"Sugar\" (an adaptation of the film \"Some Like It Hot\"), \"Absurd Person Singular,\" \"They're Playing Our Song,\" \"Doubles,\" \"Arsenic and Old Lace,\" \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway,\" \"The Seagull,\" \"The Sisters Rosensweig,\" \"Victor/Victoria,\" \"Cabaret,\" \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,\" \"Xanadu,\" and \"The Royal Family.\"\nHe joined Allen and Diane Keaton in the film version of \"Play It Again, Sam\" (directed by Herbert Ross), and went on to appear in \"Annie Hall,\" \"Stardust Memories,\" \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,\" \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" and \"Radio Days.\"\nOther film credits include \"Serpico,\" \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,\" \"Just Tell Me What You Want,\" \"Amityville 3-D,\" and \"Seize the Day.\"\nHe recounted his long career in a 2015 autobiography, \"Do You Know Me?\"\nDavid Edward Byrd\nThe poster designs of graphic artist David Edward Byrd (April 4, 1941-Feb. 3, 2025), for artists like The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Traffic, Ravi Shankar, The Grateful Dead, The Rolling Stones, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Prince and Van Halen, perfectly captured the psychedelic era of the 1960s and '70s. Byrd also created ovation-worthy posters for Broadway, for the musicals \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" \"Follies,\" \"Godspell\" and \"Little Shop of Horrors.\"\nOne admirer described Byrd's work as \"kind of like Art Nouveau on acid.\"\nBorn in Tennessee and raised in Florida, Byrd studied at the Boston Museum School and Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He later taught at the Pratt Institute and the School of Visual Arts in New York City.\nIn 1968 he was asked to create a poster for Bill Graham's Fillmore East in New York's East Village. This led to a series of graphics for concerts, tours, and record albums. He won a Grammy for the packaging of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's version of The Who's \"Tommy.\"\nThe \"Follies\" poster was inspired by an evocative portrait of Marlene Dietrich, painted in bright colors with a crack through her face. It led to numerous Broadway assignments. He also designed the movie poster for the 1975 film version of Nathanael West's \"The Day of the Locust.\"\nBeginning in the 1980s, he served as the art director for The Advocate. He published an autobiography, \"Poster Child,\" in 2023.\nIn a 2016 interview for Carnegie Mellon University, Byrd said, \"When you created a rock poster, the subject matter was neither here nor there. It had to be wild, it had to be mysterious, it had to have fantastic colors, and it had to be difficult to read. I wanted to establish a look that really punched you in the face.\"\nDick Button\nOne of the most accomplished men's figure skaters in history, Dick Button (July 18, 1929-Jan. 30, 2025) was also familiar as a broadcaster, covering skating and Olympic events for more than four decades.\nIn 1946, at age 16, he was the youngest U.S. men's champion, and two years later he won gold at the St. Moritz Olympics — the first American to win the men's event. The winner of five consecutive world championships (1948-1952), Button performed the first double axel in any competition.\nIn 1952, Button (then a student at Harvard, where he earned a law degree) won a second gold at the Oslo Games, with the first triple jump in competition. He also invented the flying camel spin. He gave up his eligibility as an amateur to perform in the Ice Capades.\nAfter the 1961 world championships were canceled following a plane crash that killed the entire U.S. figure skating team, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on \"Wide World of Sports.\" Button joined the network as a commentator, bringing figure skating to a mainstream TV audience as an Emmy-winning sports analyst.\nButton later ran professional skating events, including the World Professional Figure Skating Championships, and the Challenge of Champions. His company, Candid Productions, helped to produce programs such as \"Battle of the Network Stars\" and \"The Superstars.\"\nIn a 2014 interview with The New York Times, Button said he never tired of talking about skating: \"Skating encourages you to learn about so many art forms: dance, performance, athleticism, history, choreography, even haute couture. How could anyone tire of it?\"\nHe didn't tire of describing his own legacy: \"I was a skater with a lot of hair who too frequently wore sassy jackets,\" he said.\nMarianne Faithfull\nShe was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"\nThe daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"\nJust as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"\nShe then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.\nShe played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.\nShe fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was 8 or 10 – I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"\nIt would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"\nFaithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\"\nJules Feiffer\nThe works of the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and humorist Jules Feiffer (Jan. 26, 1929-Jan. 17, 2025) included a long-running comic strip, plays, screenplays and children's books in which he chronicled childhood, urban angst, politics, sexism, war, and other topics. To each he brought a sharp wit and acute observations of the personal and political quandaries that colored 20th century life.\nAs Feiffer explained to the Chicago Tribune in 2002, his work dealt with \"communication and the breakdown thereof, between men and women, parents and children, a government and its citizens, and the individual not dealing so well with authority.\"\nAfter attending the Pratt Institute in New York City, Feiffer drew his first comic strip, \"Clifford,\" from the late 1940s until he was drafted in 1951. After leaving the Army, he returned to cartooning, and joined The Village Voice beginning in 1956. Feiffer became a fixture of the New York City alternative weekly newspaper. His satirical strip, \"Feiffer,\" ran there for more than four decades.\nHe also wrote novels, plays and screenplays, to convey ideas, he told Time magazine, that he felt he couldn't address \"in six panels of a cartoon.\" His book \"Passionella\" became the basis of the musical \"The Apple Tree.\" He won an Obie Award for 1967's \"Little Murders,\" and wrote \"The White House Murder Case,\" \"A Think Piece,\" \"Knock Knock,\" \"Grown Ups,\" and \"A Bad Friend.\" He wrote \"Carnal Knowledge\" as both a play and a film, directed by Mike Nichols. He also scripted Robert Altman's film based on the \"Popeye\" comic strip.\nOne of his most enduring works was his illustrations for \"The Phantom Tollbooth,\" published in 1961. The adventure story of a bored child who is transformed upon entering a magic tollbooth, it was written by Feiffer's friend, Norton Juster. \"Norton would read me what he had written,\" Feiffer told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2012, \"and in order to avoid doing the work I was supposed to doing, I began sketching characters for the 'Phantom Tollbooth.' And as it evolved, it just seemed like a natural act, that if this book was going to be Illustrated, why not by me?\"\nBob Uecker\nIn six undistinguished seasons as a catcher in the majors, Bob Uecker (Jan. 26, 1934-Jan. 16, 2025) played for four teams, with a career batting average of .200. But for a half-century as a play-by-play announcer, the Milwaukee native was a mascot for his city, and for the sport at which he never quite excelled, his enthusiasm and humor earning him the nickname \"Mr. Baseball.\"\nHired by the Milwaukee Brewers as a scout, Uecker demonstrated his lack of ability in that department. But then, the team's owner moved him to the broadcast booth, where Uecker stayed for 54 years.\nA favorite Uecker line? \"'Juuuuust a bit outside.' That's where my wife put me a lotta times!\"\nHis dry wit fueled his second career as an actor, comedian, commercial pitchman, and perennial guest on Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show.\" He notably played announcer Harry Doyle in the \"Major League\" movies.\nIn 2024, Uecker told \"Sunday Morning\" he shared a bond with players on the field: \"I played the game. So, I know how hard it is. I know how tough it is. ... The game celebrations, when we win, that's a big part of it, man, to be able to walk into that clubhouse and be with 'em.\"\nDavid Lynch\nWriter, director and painter David Lynch (Jan. 20, 1946-Jan. 15, 2025) was a remarkable cinematic visionary, whose films \"Blue Velvet,\" \"Mulholland Drive,\" \"Lost Highway,\" and the TV series \"Twin Peaks\" were highly stylized dream states, evoking lost innocence, eroticism, and the roiling mysteries that exist underneath placid, peaceful exteriors. His films' interior logic would invariably prompt more questions than answers, but the imagery and sonic sensations he mastered would generate a tremendous devotion from his fellow filmmakers and audiences.\nA Montana native, Lynch studied at the American Film Institute and turned his thesis project into his first feature, \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white experimental film about parenthood. Its exceptional photography and sound design made it a cult favorite. On the basis of \"Eraserhead,\" Lynch was hired by Mel Brooks' production company to write and direct his first Hollywood feature, \"The Elephant Man.\" Lynch earned two Oscar nominations.\nHe turned down George Lucas' offer to direct the third \"Star Wars\" film, \"Return of the Jedi,\" and instead tackled Frank Herbert's \"Dune.\" A visual feast, the film was a critical failure. But his relationship with producer Dino de Laurentiis got him his next major film, \"Blue Velvet,\" an idiosyncratic murder mystery starring Kyle MacLachlan, Isabella Rossellini and Dennis Hopper.\nLynch's subsequent films, for the most part, were similarly dream-like in their narrative and presentation: \"Wild at Heart,\" \"Lost Highway,\" \"Mulholland Drive,\" \"Inland Empire.\" But his biggest imprint on the popular zeitgeist was with the 1990 TV series \"Twin Peaks,\" about the investigation into a teenage girl's murder. A wonderfully moody drama, it blended the form of TV soap operas with the paranormal, all in the deceptively tranquil setting of a Pacific Northwest logging town. Though only on ABC for two seasons, it spawned a feature film spinoff, \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,\" and a follow-up series on Showtime, in 2017.\nDespite being the director of some dark movies, Lynch called himself a \"bliss ninny.\" A longtime practitioner of transcendental meditation (or TM), in 2005 he began the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace. One of its goals: to teach students how to meditate.\nLynch told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2016 that he vividly remembers his very first experience with TM: \"I started meditation on July 1, 1973, on a sunny Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. I remember it as if it was yesterday. And it was so beautiful. I've been meditating twice a day for over 41 years and never missed a meditation.\n\"People see things like stress, traumatic stress, tension, anxiety, sorrow, depression, hate, anger and fear start to lift away,\" Lynch said. \"So, it's like pure gold coming in from within, and garbage going on.\"\nSam Moore\nIn the 1960s, Sam Moore (Oct. 12, 1935-Jan. 10, 2025) was one half of soul music's most explosive duo, Sam & Dave, who were known as \"double dynamite\" and \"the sultans of sweat.\" Their string of 10 straight Top 20 R&B hits included two soul masterpieces, \"Hold On, I'm Comin',\" \"and \"Soul Man.\"\nMoore developed his pleading tenor voice while singing in church (he initially wanted to become a preacher). In 1957, he was set to travel to Chicago to replace the great Sam Cooke in a gospel group, The Soul Stirrers. But then, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2014, he attended a Jackie Wilson concert: \"He was singing and winking and blinking and gyrating the body. ... I saw men screaming, women, and I said, I want to do that!\" laughed Moore. He ended up hiding from the gospel group, who left for Chicago without him. \"They had to, because they couldn't find me!\" he laughed.\nMoore met Dave Prater at a Miami nightclub, and their routine came together by accident. The two didn't even rehearse. \"It was all spontaneous. … We used the stage in the nightclubs like a pulpit. I preached. You would hear people from the audience go, 'Say it, Sam. Tell the truth, Sam.'\"\nProducer Jerry Wexler later caught their act, signed the duo to Atlantic Records, then sent them to Memphis, where Stax Records paired Sam & Dave with two young songwriters, Dave Porter and Isaac Hayes. The team turned out such hits as \"Soul Man,\" \"You Got Me Hummin,'\" \"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody,\" \"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby,\" \"I Thank You,\" \"Everybody Got to Believe in Somebody,\" and \"Soul Sister Brown Sugar.\"\nMoore's relationship with Prater was tumultuous, and never recovered after Prater shot and wounded his own wife in a domestic dispute in 1968. Moore recalled that he told Prater, \"'I'll sing, I'll even record with you. But I'll never talk to you again. Never. And I didn't for 12-and-a-half years. Didn't.\" (Prater died in a car accident in 1988.)\nMoore continued to tour, and in 2006 released the album \"Overnight Sensational,\" in which he performed alongside such artists as Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Mariah Carey, Sting, Billy Preston and Eric Clapton. He also recorded a tribute to George Jones with the country band Nu-Blu.\nIn 1992 Moore and (posthumously) Prater were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\nHe told \"Sunday Morning\" that he had always been uncomfortable being called the original \"Soul Man.\" \"But I know this: at the end of the night, before I leave the stage, I better do 'Soul Man.' Gotta do it. Do I get tired? Ya, but you know what? When they go into it and I look up and see them jumpin' up and down, it all leaves.\"",

    "body": "Timeline: The disappearance of George Smith\nThe family of a Connecticut man seek answers in the death of the newlywed who disappeared in 2005 while on Mediterranean honeymoon cruise.\nOn June 25, 2005, George Smith IV married Jennifer Hagel in a cliffside ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island.\nThe Smith Family\nGeorge was very close to his family. Here he is pictured with his father, George Smith III; his mother, Maureen, and his sister, Bree.\nFather and son\nGeorge Smith was slated to take over his father's liquor store in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nThe newlyweds\nNewlyweds George and Jennifer wave goodbye as they head off to catch a plane bound for their Mediterranean cruise.\nA honeymoon cruise\nOn June 29, 2005, the newlyweds, aboard Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas, set sail from Barcelona, Spain.\nThe Askins\nGeorge and Jennifer met 20-year-old Josh Askin and his family on a tour of Florence, Italy. The Askins were on the cruise as well.\nJuly 4, 2005\nOn July 4, 2005, George and Jennifer Smith spent the day touring Mykonos, Greece. George's family says Greece was one of his favorite places.\nToasting their future\nThat night, the couple had dinner aboard the ship and toasted their future together according to Jennifer.\nIn the casino\nAround midnight on July 5, the couple headed to the casino on the third floor. Casino security cameras captured Jennifer in the casino that night.\nLast known image of George Smith\nCasino security cameras also captured George at the casino. This is the last known image of George from that night.\nThe blood stain\nAt 7:30 a.m. on July 5, 2005, passengers awoke to a huge blood stain on the metal canopy. George Smith had gone overboard in the waters between Greece and Turkey.\nJennifer Smith\nJennifer Smith said she had very little memory after leaving the casino the night prior. She had been found passed out in a hallway around 4:30 a.m. -- the time George Smith is thought to have gone overboard.\nPassengers interviewed\nTurkish police boarded the ship and interviewed the last known men to see George Smith alive. Josh Askin and three Russian-American men: Rusty Kofman, Greg Rozenberg, and Zach Rozenberg. They said they had partied with George Smith into the early morning hours. [Shown clockwise from top right: Kofman, Zach Rozenberg, Greg Rozenberg and Askin]\nThe Smith's cabin\nAccording to the young men, shortly after 4 a.m., they had brought George back to his cabin and while Josh went to the bathroom, the other guys had taken off George's shoes and put a drunken George to bed. This is a photo of the Smith cabin showing one of George's shoes on the floor.\nRoom service\nThe young men said that after putting George to bed, they had all left and then went back to one of their cabins and ordered a lot of room service.\nRumors and theories\nRumors and theories surrounding George Smith's disappearance began almost immediately. Early on, the ship's captain described it as a likely accident.\nThe Smith's cabin\nA balcony chair had been found with its back against the railing. This photo taken by Royal Caribbean shows the balcony after the Turkish forensic investigation.\nBlood on bed sheets\nThe Smith family has never believed the accident theory. They believe there was foul play and point out that an \"ear witness\" heard an argument on George's balcony and George's blood had been found in the cabin -- two small lines of blood on the bed sheets.\nThe Smith's cabin\nThis photo was taken by the ship's safety officer upon entering the Smith cabin the morning of July 5, 2005. The room is messy, but not trashed.\nAttorney Mike Jones\nThe FBI has been investigating George Smith's disappearance for almost eight years, but it has gone nowhere. Mike Jones, an attorney hired by the Smiths, is trying to move the case forward.\nRoom service records checked\nIn 2010, Mike Jones got his hands on Royal Caribbean's case file. Room service records do not show any order being delivered to the men last seen with George Smith that night. Mike Jones believes that their alibis don't hold up.\nLawyer Keith Greer\nJosh Askin's lawyer, Keith Greer, argues that it could have been an oversight in the hand-written documentation.\nGreg Rozenberg questioned\nMike Jones took the depositions of the four young men last seen with George Smith. In 2010, he found Greg Rozenberg in a Florida prison serving a three-year sentence for trafficking oxycodone. Greg Rozenberg told Jones he didn't have it in his heart to kill anyone.\nProvacative video\nJones learned of a potentially damaging videotape made by some of these men just hours after George disappeared. On the tape, Jones says the three Russian-Americans are seen and heard making callous remarks about George's death and at the end Greg Rozenberg says \"I told you I was gangsta.\"\nThe provocative videotape\nThe FBI is in possession of the provocative videotape and the Smith family wonders why more has not been done. Lawyers for the young men say that their clients did nothing wrong. No one has ever been charged in connection with George Smith's disappearance.\nGeorge Smith\nThe Smith family hopes that one day the case will be solved and say they will never stop fighting for George.\nAnyone with information related to George Smith's disappearance is asked to call 1-844-651-1936 or send an email to georgesmithtipline@gmail.com",
